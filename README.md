# Daily Paper
This project is an automated pipeline for fetching, filtering, summarizing, and categorizing research papers from ArXiv. The goal is to streamline the process of identifying and analyzing research papers relevant to user-defined keywords. Using GitHub Actions for automation and an external Large Language Model (LLM) for summarization and scoring, the tool creates daily markdown reports of papers and highlights the most important ones.
