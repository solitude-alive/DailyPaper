- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image" addresses the challenges faced in evaluating the fidelity of images restored through Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, particularly those enhanced by recent advancements such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Traditional Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) techniques fall short, as they do not adequately measure the perceptual quality of restored images. The authors propose a new Image Quality Assessment system that evaluates fidelity through a methodology termed Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI), rather than direct comparisons with reference images. They introduce a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm to assess consistency across various degradation types without needing prior knowledge of the degradation parameters. Additionally, they propose a Reference Agnostic CDI method that eliminates the requirement of reference images altogether. To substantiate their method, the authors created a new dataset, the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD), for subjective evaluations, illustrating that their CDI approach significantly outperforms traditional Full Reference IQA methods in assessing BIR fidelity. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several notable contributions to the field of Blind Image Restoration (BIR) and Image Quality Assessment (IQA).  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The introduction of Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI) provides a fresh perspective on assessing BIR quality, a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on direct comparisons with reference images. This shift in approach addresses the critical issues of solution non-uniqueness and degradation indeterminacy inherent in BIR.     2. **Methodological Innovation:** The use of wavelet transformations to assess image consistency indicates a strong grasp of the technical aspects of image processing, and the development of both Reference Guided and Reference Agnostic methods widens the applicability of their approach significantly. 3. **Dataset Creation:** The introduction of the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluations is a constructive addition to the field, providing resources for performance validation of various methods against a consistent benchmark. 4. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments demonstrate that CDI offers substantial improvements over traditional methods, establishing its effectiveness in real-world applications of BIR. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the proposed CDI method shows superiority over traditional methods, the paper does not adequately discuss its limitations or the conditions under which its performance might degrade. Details regarding the type and extent of image degradations where CDI might fail to provide reliable assessments would strengthen the discussion. 2. **Lack of Extensive Comparative Analysis:** While comparisons with Full Reference methods are made, the paper could benefit from evaluations against other emerging IQA methods, particularly those aligned with deep learning frameworks, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its positioning in the current landscape. 3. **Subjectivity in Dataset Generation:** As the subjective nature of image quality assessment can vary among evaluators, the methodology for creating DISDCD may introduce biases that should be addressed to reinforce the credibility of the findings. This paper effectively introduces a promising paradigm in the evaluation of BIR fidelity, filling a significant gap in current methods. However, for its impact to reach its full potential, further validation and exploration of its boundaries are necessary. **Score: 8**  Overall, the contributions are substantial and hold the potential to significantly influence both BIR and IQA methodologies, earning a high score due to its innovative approach and practical applications. The weaknesses identified, while notable, do not overshadow the overall merit of the work, thus justifying an 8 rather than a higher score.
