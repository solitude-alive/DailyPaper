The BRiTE algorithm operates in two main phases: (1) it generates high-quality rationales through reinforcement learning with an innovative reward shaping method, and (2) it optimizes the base LLM’s performance by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation. The authors claim theoretical convergence of BRiTE at a rate of $1/T$ as iterations increase. Empirical tests on math and coding tasks reveal that BRiTE enhances performance across various model bases, outperforming both existing bootstrapping algorithms and even matching the effectiveness of supervised fine-tuning approaches that utilize human-annotated data. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The BRiTE framework presents a noteworthy advancement in the field of LLM reasoning, particularly through its novel approach of integrating reinforcement learning with a graphical model. By focusing on rationales as a key element of reasoning and optimizing the model's parameters for rationale generation, it tackles a significant challenge in model comprehension and performance, adding a valuable dimension to existing techniques. The use of reward shaping stands out as both innovative and practical.  **Strengths:** 1. The two-step process for generating rationales and enhancing LLMs provides a clear framework that is grounded in established machine learning principles, making it both credible and reproducible. 2. The empirical results demonstrating performance improvements across several benchmarks lend strong validation to the proposed method. 3. The theoretical analysis concerning the convergence of the BRiTE algorithm adds a layer of mathematical rigor to the framework, which is vital for its credibility. **Weaknesses:** 1. While the empirical results are promising, more comprehensive experimentation across a wider range of tasks and with various types of LLMs would strengthen the argument for BRiTE's generalizability. 2.

- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper titled "Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior" critically examines the methodology behind Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), a technique widely utilized for addressing inverse problems using diffusion models. The authors assert that previous interpretations of DPS as a conditional score estimator are flawed; rather, it aligns more closely with a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) principle. Through empirical evaluations using ImageNet images, they highlight significant deficiencies in DPS's conditional score estimation, pointing out its divergence from expected scores, higher levels of sample quality but reduced diversity, and mean deviation from zero, suggesting invalid estimation. The authors then introduce enhancements to DPS, advocating for the explicit maximization of posterior probabilities and proposing a lightweight conditional score estimator. Experimental results show marked improvements in DPS's performance following these modifications. The source code for these enhancements is made available online. **Evaluation**: In terms of novelty, the paper presents a compelling critique of an established method—DPS—by successfully challenging the common understanding of its functionality. It encourages a reevaluation of traditional frameworks in diffusion models, moving beyond relying solely on conditional score estimations. This shift to emphasize MAP principles introduces a new direction for research in the field. The enhancements proposed are practical and based on empirical evidence, motivating further advancements in sampling techniques. However, while the critique is valid and the proposed modifications show improved performance, one may argue that the extent of innovation may not be groundbreaking but rather represents a refinement of existing methodologies. Additionally, the reliance on a relatively small dataset (100 images) for training the conditional score estimator raises questions about scalability and generalizability in broader applications. Despite these weaknesses, the paper significantly contributes to the discourse on diffusion models, urging future researchers to reconsider foundational assumptions and explore new pathways for advancement.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s importance in advancing the understanding of DPS by challenging prevailing assumptions, as well as its practical contributions, while acknowledging some limitations in the scale of experimentation and the generalizability of the proposed methods.

The authors propose a blackbox adaptation technique called Retrieval Augmented Search (RAS), which employs a beam search strategy to discover program optimizations. At each search step, RAS retrieves in-context examples of slow-fast program pairs from a training dataset, based on descriptions generated by the LLM, rather than relying on source code alone. This approach shows improved performance over traditional retrieval methods. Additionally, the authors introduce AEGIS, a technique that enhances interpretability by breaking down training examples into smaller, "atomic edits." The results demonstrate that RAS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 1.8 times, and AEGIS results in a 1.37 times improvement with smaller edits.  ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance This paper presents a substantial advancement in the application of LLMs for program optimization, which has garnered increasing interest in the programming languages research community. The introduction of RAS is particularly noteworthy, as it shifts the paradigm from traditional code-based retrieval to contextual retrieval using natural language descriptions. This shift addresses a critical oversight in prior methods, enhancing the effectiveness of optimization tasks by aligning with how humans conceptualize program behavior. #### Strengths: 1. **Innovation**: The proposal of using an LLM-generated natural language description for contextual retrieval signifies a creative and well-justified approach to program optimization that builds on existing methodologies. 2. **Performance Metrics**: The reported improvements (1.8x for RAS and 1.37x for AEGIS) over previous methods are compelling, suggesting significant advancements in both efficiency and interpretability. 3. **Interpretability**: The AEGIS method addresses a prevalent concern in machine learning and programming; by decomposing changes into atomic edits, it allows for a clearer understanding of the optimization process. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generality**: The paper lacks a discussion on the scalability of RAS across different types or sizes of programming tasks. It's essential to assess whether these methods hold up under various conditions or languages beyond the tested scenarios. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: While improvements over state-of-the-art techniques are shown, a deeper comparative analysis with a broader set of methodologies might provide greater context for the magnitude of these improvements. 3. **Data Dependency**: The reliance on a specific training dataset raises concerns about generalization; it may limit the applicability of RAS and AEGIS to cases where similar slow-fast pairs exist. #### Conclusion: Overall, the paper provides innovative solutions to current challenges in program optimization using LLMs and shows promising results. Nevertheless, a more extensive exploration of limitations and broader applicability would elevate the insights. Hence, I assign a score based on the presented contributions and potential impact on the field while considering the aforementioned strengths and weaknesses. **Score: 8**
