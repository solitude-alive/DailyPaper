Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency or require extensive retraining when priors are adjusted. The Distribution Transformer maps prior distributions, modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to corresponding posterior distributions using a transformer architecture, which incorporates both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. This results in a flexible system that can efficiently accommodate varying priors while significantly decreasing computation times—from minutes to milliseconds. The authors demonstrate that the Distribution Transformer can achieve competitive or superior log-likelihood performance compared to existing methods across various applications, including sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference. ### Evaluation **Novelty:** The Distribution Transformer introduces an innovative approach by synthesizing transformer architectures and GMMs for approximating Bayesian inference.

The study attributes the limited transferability to the overfitting of attack strategies to the source model's parameters. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a novel approach called the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which helps obscure harmful intents by dispersing focus across neutral tokens. The results from extensive experiments suggest that PiF significantly enhances the effectiveness of red-teaming evaluations for proprietary LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy characteristics that contribute to its significance in the field of AI safety and security. Firstly, it tackles a pressing issue—jailbreaking of LLMs—that holds substantial relevance given the rapid advancement and deployment of these technologies. By focusing on enhancing the transferability of jailbreaking attacks and presenting a novel approach (PiF), the authors address a clear gap in existing research concerning the limitations of adversarial strategies on proprietary systems. One of the core strengths of this work is its empirical basis; the authors provide extensive experimental results to validate their methodology and findings, which enhances the credibility of their claims. The introduction of the PiF method is innovative and offers a practical avenue for improving the robustness of proprietary LLMs against manipulation, contributing valuable insights for developers and researchers in AI safety. However, there are several areas where the paper could see improvement. The analysis of limited transferability primarily focuses on model intent perception but does not extensively explore other factors that could impact transferability, such as model architecture or training data diversity. A broader exploration could enrich the findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the transferability issue. Additionally, while the proposed method shows promise, its evaluation might benefit from an exploration of real-world applicability, including scalability to different LLM architectures or varying attack vectors. In terms of novelty, the introduction of PiF stands out as a significant contribution; however, the background context regarding adversarial attack methodologies is fairly established in prior literature, slightly detracting from the paper's innovative edge. Overall, the paper's contribution to the field is impactful, especially concerning practical red-teaming strategies for addressing vulnerabilities in AI models. The proposed method is relevant and timely in the context of ongoing discussions about LLM safety. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a recognition of the paper's novel approach and empirical contributions while accounting for areas that could benefit from further exploration and the background established in existing literature. The work has the potential to significantly influence practices in securing proprietary LLMs against jailbreaking attacks.

### **[Structured Token Retention and Computational Memory Paths in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03102v1)**
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents Structured Token Retention (STR) and Computational Memory Paths (CMP), innovative approaches to enhance memory retention in large language models (LLMs) for better handling of extended sequences. Traditional token management methods often lead to inefficiencies due to rigid retention thresholds or uniform attention weights, which can cause significant information loss. STR proposes a probabilistic framework that adjusts the retention of tokens based on contextual importance, while CMP builds upon this by providing a hierarchical memory allocation that optimally reallocates token embeddings based on structured criteria. The authors demonstrate through empirical assessments that these methods improve the survival rates of tokens in long sequences and reduce errors across processing layers. Moreover, they highlight improvements in inference speed and context coherence, along with a more efficient use of resources in attention calculations. The integration of these methodologies into an open-source model underscores their versatility in applications such as generative text processing and scalable sequence modeling. ### Critical Evaluation This paper presents several innovative contributions to the fields of natural language processing and architecture design for LLMs. The introduction of the STR framework is particularly notable; it moves away from conventional, static methods for memory retention and provides a probabilistic model that is adaptive to context. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the integrity and relevance of information over long sequences, a persistent challenge in the field. CMP further enhances STR by providing more structured memory management, resulting in higher retention efficiency and less error propagation. This hierarchical enhancement signifies a deeper understanding of token relationships over extended contexts, equipping future models with better data handling capabilities. The empirical results indicated in the paper are promising, showing improved retention rates and efficiency metrics compared to baseline models. However, while the novelty of these approaches is evident, there are areas that could limit the impact of the research. The paper could benefit from more extensive comparisons with a wider variety of existing models and more nuanced discussions on the limitations of STR and CMP. Additionally, scalability and potential trade-offs in multi-task scenarios or other varied language tasks remain underexplored, raising questions about the generalizability of the proposed methods. Overall, the paper provides significant contributions to improving LLM performance on extended sequences, laying foundational work for future research.

### **[SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SymAgent, a neural-symbolic framework designed to enhance complex reasoning capabilities by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Existing methods suffer from two main limitations: they often disregard KG incompleteness and treat KGs as static databases without leveraging their logical structures. SymAgent addresses these issues by conceptualizing KGs as dynamic environments, allowing them to actively engage in a multi-step reasoning process. The framework includes two core components: an Agent-Planner, which uses LLMs for extracting symbolic rules and efficient question decomposition, and an Agent-Executor, which autonomously gathers information from KGs and external sources to mitigate completeness issues. The self-learning aspect of SymAgent enables continuous improvement through exploration and iterative updates. Experiments show that SymAgent outperforms or matches strong baselines even with weaker LLMs. The framework's capability to identify missing triples also permits automatic updates to KGs. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the SymAgent framework lies in its integration of dynamic reasoning and self-learning within a neural-symbolic architecture, differentiating it from existing approaches that treat KGs statically and fail to account for their incompleteness. This conceptual shift represents a significant step forward in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, which is vital given the challenges associated with hallucinations in LLM outputs. Strengths of the paper include its innovative approach to treating KGs as dynamic entities, the effective use of LLMs to extract symbolic rules, and the implementation of a self-learning mechanism that enables continuous improvement. The empirical results demonstrating performance improvements over established baselines add credibility to the framework. However, there are some limitations. The performance comparisons might not cover all relevant models or approaches, potentially underestimating the competitiveness of alternative methodologies. The paper could also benefit from more extensive discussions on the scalability of the proposed framework and its applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors do not extensively discuss the limitations of their approach or the potential risks associated with relying on KGs and self-learning methods. Given these strengths and weaknesses, as well as the reasonable potential for SymAgent to influence future research in neural-symbolic reasoning and knowledge graph applications, I would assign a score of **8**. This reflects a substantial contribution to the field, with room for further exploration and refinement in subsequent research. **Score: 8**

- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation" discusses a novel approach to intent-based recommendation systems, which are essential for uncovering users' fine-grained preferences. The authors argue that existing methods for defining intent often fail to use available textual information, such as user reviews and item descriptions, which can help address the sparsity of interaction data. They highlight two main challenges: aligning multimodal intents while managing noise and matching latent intents across different modalities. To address these challenges, they introduce a model-agnostic framework called Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec) that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents. The framework uses a dual-tower architecture for intent representation, employs pairwise and translation alignment to manage modal discrepancies, and incorporates momentum distillation for effective teacher-student learning on intent representations. Empirical results on three datasets demonstrate that IRLLRec outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing recommendation systems. The code for the implementation is made available online. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The originality of this paper lies in its attempt to merge intents derived from various modalities (textual data and interaction data) using a large language model framework, addressing a gap in traditional intent-based recommendation systems. While the application of LLMs is becoming common, the specific use of a dual-tower architecture, alignment methodologies, and momentum distillation to harmonize multimodal representations and combat noise is a relatively novel contribution. **Significance:** The significance of the research is notable, especially concerning the growing importance of interpretability in recommendation systems.

### **[A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03450v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework that facilitates reasoning and planning over scene graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features two cooperative LLM agents: a Reasoner, which generates task plans and information queries, and a Retriever, which extracts relevant graph data based on those queries. This two-agent system allows them to collaborate iteratively, promoting sequential reasoning and improved attention to graph information. A distinct advantage of this approach is that both agents are only provided with the schema of the scene graph rather than the entire graph data, effectively mitigating issues of hallucination by limiting input and prompting the Reasoner to produce more abstract traces. Subsequently, the Retriever retrieves necessary data dynamically, optimizing alignment between reasoning and retrieval processes. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-RwR outperforms existing LLM-based methods in numerical question answering and planning tasks, also showing adaptability to task-level few-shot examples without relying on agent-level demonstrations. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of SG-RwR lies in its dual-agent architecture focused on scene graphs, which represents a differentiated approach compared to previous LLM applications that often deal with full graph data. By emphasizing a schema-guided methodology, the authors address the challenges of information overload and the tendency for LLMs to generate irrelevant outcomes (hallucinations). This methodology is particularly significant in contexts that demand structured reasoning, such as planning in complex environments. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The introduction of a cooperative dual-agent system is a clear advancement in the field of spatial reasoning with LLMs.  2. **Reduction of Hallucination**: By employing a schema rather than full data, the potential for LLMs to exhibit hallucinations appears to be significantly reduced. 3. **Empirical Validation**: Through comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over existing models, the authors bolster the credibility of their claims. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Generalization Concerns**: While the results appear promising, the effectiveness of the framework across diverse real-world scenarios hasn't been established, potentially limiting its generalizability. 2. **Scalability**: The reliance on schema-guided methods raises questions about scalability and adaptability within more complex or varied environments. 3. **Implementation Details**: The framework's implementation may not be trivial, and the paper lacks detailed explanation on the potential challenges others may face in replication or application. In comparison to existing works, while SG-RwR does offer a significant contribution, it may not represent a paradigm shift in the field of LLM reasoning. It builds upon prior studies but provides a noteworthy enhancement rather than a completely new methodology. Given the framework's innovative approach, empirical support, and the potential for practical applications in spatial reasoning, I assign a score of 8. This score reflects the paper's significant but not groundbreaking contribution, acknowledging both its strengths and its limitations in broader applicability or transformative impact within the field. **Score: 8**

### **[Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03460v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training" focuses on enhancing the efficiency of small language models (SLMs) through a novel pruning technique called layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner). This approach aims to address the challenges of training SLMs from scratch or pruning existing large language models (LLMs), which often results in performance degradation. The key findings include: 1. Adapt-Pruner significantly improves the performance of LLMs through more effective pruning. 2. When combined with further training, adaptive pruning achieves performance levels comparable to models pre-trained from scratch. 3. An incremental pruning strategy allows for fine-tuning during the training process, gradually removing around 5% of neurons at a time and leading to notable performance gains. Experimentally, Adapt-Pruner surpasses existing methods (LLM-Pruner, FLAP, SliceGPT) by 1%-7% accuracy on commonsense benchmarks using LLaMA-3.1-8B. Moreover, it restores MobileLLM-125M performance on the MMLU benchmark to a level akin to that of larger models while using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, it achieves the novel development of a new 1B model that outperforms the LLaMA-3.2-1B across multiple benchmarks. --- **Evaluation:** The paper presents a clear advancement in the field of small language model optimization, primarily via its proposed Adapt-Pruner technique. Its ability to enhance performance while effectively pruning demonstrates significant novelty, especially given the challenges associated with maintaining model efficacy post-pruning. Conventional methods typically fall short by either suffering from substantial performance drops or requiring prohibitive computational resources for training from scratch.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** Introduces a new methodology for structured pruning which is shown to be effective and adaptable during training phases. 2. **Comparative Results:** Empirical validation against existing state-of-the-art pruning methods showcases tangible improvements. 3. **Broader Implications:** The ability to create smaller models with high performance is particularly relevant for deployment on edge devices, aligning with current industry trends focusing on efficiency. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising for specific configurations (like LLaMA-3.1-8B), the generalizability of the findings to other architectures or tasks warrants further exploration. 2. **Complexity in Application:** The proposed method may introduce additional complexity into the model training process which could hinder adoption among practitioners who prefer simpler approaches. 3. **Limited Theoretical Framework:** The paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning justifying the mechanisms behind adaptive pruning's effectiveness. **Final Influence:** While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of model compression and efficiency for SLMs, its impact could be tempered by the need for further validations across diverse contexts and architectures. Future work could explore the breadth of Adapt-Pruner's applicability, potentially increasing its significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's innovative contributions and its pragmatic application in a relevant field, while also accounting for the need for further validation and simplification for broader adoption.
- **Score**: 8/10
