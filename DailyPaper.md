### **[Bilevel ZOFO: Bridging Parameter-Efficient and Zeroth-Order Techniques for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning and Meta-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03604v1)**
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces Bilevel ZOFO, a novel optimization framework that integrates Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with Zeroth-Order (ZO) techniques to improve the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) while reducing computational demands. The key challenge addressed is the high resource requirement associated with fine-tuning LLMs using First-Order (FO) optimizers. While PEFT allows for fine-tuning a small subset of parameters, it may underperform in achieving optimal task-specific results compared to full fine-tuning. On the other hand, ZO methods eliminate back-propagation but require effective hard prompts, which can be suboptimal when fixed. Bilevel ZOFO employs a double-loop optimization strategy, allowing the use of gradients from the PEFT model alongside ZO methods, thus enhancing flexibility and performance. The paper provides theoretical guarantees for the convergence of Bilevel ZOFO and empirical evidence showing that it outperforms both standard PEFT and ZO methods in single-task setups while maintaining memory efficiency. Furthermore, it demonstrates promising results for multitask learning with lower computational demands compared to existing first-order meta-training algorithms. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the realm of large-scale model fine-tuning by proposing an innovative dual-approach framework that combines existing PEFT and ZO techniques. The originality lies in addressing the weaknesses of each method — the sensitivity to hard prompts in ZO and the potential performance limitations of PEFT — and proposing a solution that seeks to leverage the strengths of both.  The convergence guarantees offered provide theoretical backing to the methodology, which is critical for the adoption in academic and industrial settings. Furthermore, the empirical results indicating that Bilevel ZOFO not only competes on performance with existing methods but also brings down computational resource requirements is highly relevant in an era where model size and by extension, computational costs are growing. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework:** The Bilevel ZOFO presents a compelling synthesis of two prominent methods in a way that enhances their strengths and mitigates weaknesses. 2. **Theoretical Contribution:** The convergence guarantees add a layer of scholarly rigor that supports its claims. 3. **Empirical Validation:** Strong empirical results demonstrating both the efficiency and effectiveness of the method across tasks validate its practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The implementation details of a bilevel optimization framework can be complex, which might constitute a barrier for practitioners wanting to adopt the methodology without sufficient background. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** While performance improvements in specific tasks are shown, generalizability across a wide array of tasks and models may require further investigation. 3. **Limited Comparative Analysis:** While the study compares against PEFT and ZO, a broader comparison with more recent state-of-the-art methods could provide a deeper understanding of where Bilevel ZOFO stands. Given the above factors, I would assigned a **Score: 8**. The paper makes a noticeable contribution towards bridging the gap between PEFT and ZO methods, presents innovative approaches to fine-tuning LLMs effectively, and seems poised to influence future research directions in efficient model training. However, further examination of its practical implementation challenges and broader applicability will be necessary to fully assess its impact in the field.

They propose a perturbation-constrained selection algorithm aimed at minimizing output perturbation, which shows substantial improvements over current cache eviction techniques in benchmarks like Needle-in-a-Haystack and Longbench. The algorithm notably reduces output perturbations in over 92% of attention heads within the Llama model, showcasing its efficacy. **Evaluation**:   The novelty of this paper lies in its formal approach to an often-empirical problem of identifying critical KV cache entries, which broadens the understanding beyond just attention weights to include value states and pretrained parameters. This comprehensive view could potentially lead to better caching strategies in large models, making the research relevant and timely given the growing demands for efficiency in LLM inference. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Formal Analysis**: By grounding their approach in perturbation theory, the authors provide a strong theoretical justification for their method, advancing the conversation in a well-regarded field. 2. **Algorithmic Contribution**: The proposed perturbation-constrained selection algorithm is a clear advancement over existing methods, with empirical results demonstrating its effectiveness. 3. **Relevant Benchmarks**: Testing on recognized benchmarks increases the applicability and credibility of the findings. However, the paper also has weaknesses: 1. **Scope of Analysis**: While the study improves upon current methods, practical deployment aspects, such as computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm, aren't fully explored. 2. **Generalizability**: There are no discussions on how these findings can be transferred or applied to other model architectures beyond what was tested in the specific Llama model, which may limit broader impact. Given these points and considering the active interest in optimizing LLMs, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field, although there’s room for further expansion on deployment and applicability. **Score: 8**

### **[DeblurDiff: Real-World Image Deblurring with Generative Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03810v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents DeblurDiff, a novel method for real-world image deblurring using Generative Diffusion Models, specifically leveraging the pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models. The critical innovation is the introduction of the Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN), which is trained in latent space alongside the conditional diffusion process. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel to guide the restoration of sharp images by employing element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), which helps maintain structural integrity during the deblurring process. This approach allows for iterative kernel estimation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness in image restoration. Through extensive experiments, the proposed method reportedly outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques on both benchmark and real-world datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's novelty lies primarily in the combination of latent space processing with adaptive convolution techniques to enhance the deblurring efficacy of generative models. By addressing the limitations of using blurry or pre-deblurred images as conditions for Stable Diffusion, it seeks to refine the deblurring process without compromising on detail. The LKPN's capability to adaptively adjust to input features through learned kernels represents a meaningful advancement in the field, particularly in real-world applications where image blurriness can vary significantly. However, the paper does have certain weaknesses. One potential shortcoming is the heavy reliance on existing diffusion models, which may limit the perceived originality of the contribution. While the method shows promise in its improvements over benchmarks, the comparisons must be scrutinized. If the state-of-the-art methods included are not rigorously selected, the claim of outperforming them could be undermined. Additionally, the continual emphasis on structural integrity might overshadow other crucial aspects of image quality, such as color fidelity or noise levels, which should also be assessed in practical deblurring tasks. In summary, the implementation of LKPN alongside diffusion models is a novel step forward in image deblurring that pushes the boundaries of current methodologies. The thorough approach taken in training and adapting the model adds substantial merit to the work. Therefore, while there are limitations and potential areas for stronger validation, the overall contribution is significant enough to warrant a positive evaluation. **Score: 8**

### **[Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper: Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs** The paper introduces Syntriever, a novel training framework designed for information retrieval systems that leverages synthetic data generated from black-box Large Language Models (LLMs). Recognizing that traditional distillation methods rely on output probabilities which are not available in contemporary LLMs, the authors propose a two-stage approach.  In the first stage, known as the distillation stage, Syntriever generates both relevant and irrelevant passages along with augmented queries through a "chain of thoughts" methodology. The model then performs self-verification to identify and rectify any synthetic data hallucinations before training retrievers with an embedding clustering loss function focused on relevant passages.  The second stage, termed the alignment stage, involves refining the retriever's output to better match the preferences exhibited by LLMs. This is accomplished through a preference modeling technique called partial Plackett-Luce ranking, which introduces regularization to ensure consistent alignment with the previously trained model in the distillation phase.  Empirical results demonstrate that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performance across various domains in terms of normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG@$K$). The authors also provide open access to their code to facilitate further use and exploration of their framework. --- **Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance** **Novelty (Score: 8/10)**:  Syntriever presents a significant advancement in the domain of information retrieval by addressing the challenges faced with black-box LLMs. The method of using synthetic data creation (relevant and irrelevant passages) in conjunction with a self-verification mechanism is innovative, particularly in the context of LLMs where traditional output probabilities cannot be harnessed. The two-stage process balances the need for robust training data with a nuanced approach to aligning the retrievers with LLM preferences. This represents a novel contribution to the integration of LLMs in information retrieval tasks. While the use of synthetic data itself is not new, the application of such a method in the specific context of black-box LLMs showcases significant originality. **Impact (Score: 7/10)**:  The practical implications of Syntriever are evidently robust given its state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. This suggests it could significantly enhance retrieval systems in real-world applications, which is critical as the demand for effective information retrieval continues to grow in tandem with the proliferation of LLMs. However, the paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion on potential limitations of synthetic data (e.g., biases, representativeness) and its application to different retrieval tasks and contexts. Perhaps more empirical comparisons to existing methods could further establish its relative impact in the field. **Strengths**:  - Novel integration of synthetic data from LLMs tailored specifically for retriever training. - Strong empirical results showcasing performance improvements over traditional methods. - Code availability fostering further development and usability within the research community. **Weaknesses**:  - Limited discussion on the robustness of the synthetic data against potential biases and limitations. - The need for comprehensive comparisons with a broader range of existing methods to validate claims of superiority. In conclusion, Syntriever is a compelling contribution to the body of research on information retrieval systems, particularly in leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. Its dual-stage training framework is innovative and well-founded, although some areas could see improvement through deeper analysis and broader empirical validation. **Score: 8**
