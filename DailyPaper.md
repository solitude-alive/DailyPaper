The model addresses the challenges faced by large-scale models, particularly in resource-constrained environments like edge devices. To enhance both efficiency and predictive performance on non-stationary time series, SWIFT leverages wavelet transform for lossless downsampling, integrates cross-band information through a learnable filter, and utilizes a shared linear layer or shallow MLP for mapping sub-series. Through comprehensive experimentation, SWIFT demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets while maintaining a significantly reduced parameter count—only 25% of that of a single-layer linear model—making it a promising option for practical applications in edge computing. Code implementation for this model is made publicly available. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance 1. **Novelty**:     The paper introduces several innovative techniques, specifically the use of wavelet decomposition for lossless downsampling and cross-band information fusion, which are not commonly implemented together in traditional time-series forecasting methods.

### **[Sparse Autoencoders Trained on the Same Data Learn Different Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16615v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Sparse Autoencoders Trained on the Same Data Learn Different Features" investigates the behavior of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) when trained on large language models (LLMs). The key finding is that different SAEs, initialized with different random seeds but trained on the same model and dataset, extract substantially different feature sets. Specifically, the study reports that only 30% of the features are consistent across different seeds in an SAE with 131K latents on a feedforward network in Llama 3 8B. This variability is consistent across multiple layers of three different LLMs and two datasets, highlighting the inherent randomness in feature extraction by SAEs. Notably, while ReLU-based SAEs demonstrate more stability across seeds, SAEs using the TopK activation function show significant seed-dependence, regardless of sparsity constraints. The authors argue that the features identified by SAEs should be seen as practical representations of activation spaces rather than definitive features that are universally applicable. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a thought-provoking challenge to the understanding of SAEs in the context of LLMs. By demonstrating that feature extraction is significantly affected by the initialization parameters, it contributes a critical insight into the reliability of features learned by SAEs.
