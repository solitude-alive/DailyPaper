### **[Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18913v1)**
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior" examines the framework of Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), a method utilized in diffusion models for solving inverse problems. The authors challenge the current understanding that DPS operates primarily by approximating the conditional score, arguing instead that it more closely aligns with the principles of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation. Their investigation reveals several significant issues: (1) DPS's conditional score estimation diverges substantially from established conditional scores, (2) its mean score estimation notably strays from zero, and (3) it generates qualitatively high samples with reduced diversity. To address these shortcomings, the authors propose enhancements to DPS by implementing multi-step gradient ascent for explicit posterior maximization and employing a simplified conditional score estimator trained on limited data. Experimental results demonstrate that these modifications lead to notable performance improvements. The authors share their code online for wider accessibility. **Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its critical reevaluation of DPS and its theoretical basis, which is positioned to shift the discourse surrounding diffusion models in solving inverse problems. The finding that the conditional score estimation is both ineffective and misleading presents a strong argument for the proposed changes, marking a discontinuity from established practices.

Moreover, while the theoretical discourse is substantial, the paper might benefit from more extensive comparative analyses with existing methods beyond those mentioned. Also, the eventual implications on broader applications of diffusion models could be clarified further. In conclusion, the paper presents a significant contribution to the understanding of DPS by reevaluating its core operation and proposing actionable improvements. It opens avenues for subsequent research and potential application refinements in diffusion models. Score: 8

- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them" addresses a significant issue in diffusion models related to the selective unlearning of harmful content, termed concept erasure. Previous methods used a fixed-target approach to replace undesirable concepts, which the authors argue is suboptimal because it does not consider the interrelated structure of concepts, leading to unintended consequences. The authors propose a novel approach called Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE), which uses a graph representation of the concept space to dynamically select target concepts tailored to each specific concept that needs erasure. Their experiments demonstrate that AGE preserves unrelated concepts better than existing methods while effectively achieving the intended concept removal. The code for implementing AGE is available publicly. ### Critical Evaluation: The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its approach to concept erasure.

While speculative decoding allows for accelerated generation by utilizing a faster draft model to propose candidate tokens, it often fails to retain quality because high-quality draft tokens are frequently rejected during the verification process with the target model. The authors argue that this low acceptance rate is primarily due to excessive reliance on alignment between draft and target models. To address this, they propose an innovative method that adapts the verification process to identify and accept valid tokens that may not align perfectly with the target model. Drawing inspiration from the LLM-as-a-judge framework, they create a dataset and train a compact module to evaluate token continuations more flexibly. Their approach is demonstrated on the Llama-3.1 family, yielding a significant speedup in generation rates (up to 9x faster) without sacrificing quality on diverse benchmarks, even in optimized inference scenarios. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the field of LLM inference techniques by addressing a critical bottleneck—the drastic rejection rates in speculative decoding due to alignment issues.
