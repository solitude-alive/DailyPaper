Traditional fault localization methods require extensive supplementary data, such as source code or test failures, which are often unavailable in production environments. The authors specifically tackle scenarios where the root cause of a crash is not indicated by the closest stack trace entries. To address the limitations posed by a lack of historical crash data, the authors augment their dataset by generating synthetic crashes through code mutation, resulting in a dataset of 64,369 crashes from 4.1 million mutations from the SAP HANA code base. The approach yields a fault localization accuracy of 66.9%, substantially outperforming baseline methods that achieved 12.6% and 10.6%. Further testing on other open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, reveals accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. The results suggest that fine-tuning LLMs is significantly more effective than using non-finetuned models for fault localization in these scenarios. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper introduces a significant innovation by applying fine-tuning of LLMs to the specific domain of fault localization using only stack trace information.

- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents EvalPlanner, an innovative algorithm designed to enhance the process of evaluating responses generated by large language models (LLMs). Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches often limit their reasoning to pre-defined frameworks, including specific criteria and manually generated components. EvalPlanner diverges from this norm by generating an unconstrained evaluation plan, executing it, and rendering a final judgment. Through a self-training mechanism involving synthetic evaluation plans and executions, EvalPlanner optimizes reasoning capabilities, resulting in improved final verdicts. The method sets a new benchmark in performance for generative reward models on the RewardBench, achieving a score of 93.9 and demonstrating efficacy across various other benchmarks such as RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies primarily in its approach to separating planning and execution within the evaluation process of LLMs. Previous methodologies often conflated these stages, potentially leading to rigid and less effective reasoning processes. By allowing for an unconstrained planning stage, the authors introduce flexibility that could lead to richer and more accurate evaluations of generated responses. One of the strengths of the paper is its empirical validation. The authors not only achieve state-of-the-art results on RewardBench but also demonstrate the effectiveness of EvalPlanner across multiple benchmarks. This broad testing supports the claim of efficacy and indicates that the method can generalize well to different types of evaluation tasks in the realm of LLMs. However, a potential weakness is the reliance on synthetically generated evaluation plans and preference pairs, which may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of human judgment. While self-training can provide significant advancements, the degree to which synthetic data can replace human annotations for establishing robust reasoning processes remains a point of contention. Future work may need to integrate more human-in-the-loop approaches to bolster the reliability of these evaluations. Overall, the paper represents a thoughtful advance in the landscape of LLM evaluation methodologies. It opens doors for subsequent research to explore the interplay between planning and reasoning in AI evaluations and offers a fresh perspective on approaching generative models' assessments. Considering the strengths of the undeniably innovative approach and its significant empirical contributions, along with noted weaknesses surrounding the reliance on synthetic evaluations, I assign this paper a score of **8**. **Score: 8**

### **[CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18457v1)**
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering" investigates the inconsistencies in performance that large language models (LLMs) exhibit across different languages when answering culture-independent questions. The authors introduce a novel framework called CALM, which leverages the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of language models. Under this framework, for a given question, the model samples multiple responses from various languages and selects the most consistent one as the target, while treating others as negative examples. This process is facilitated by direct preference optimization (DPO) to align knowledge across languages effectively. The paper reports evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets that demonstrate CALM's efficacy in improving cross-lingual question answering accuracy in both zero-shot and retrieval-augmented scenarios. Additionally, increasing the number of languages during CALM training appears to further enhance accuracy and consistency. The authors also provide a qualitative analysis showing how cross-lingual consistency contributes to better knowledge alignment and discuss the generalizability of their method. The paper concludes with the availability of its source code and datasets on GitHub. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The concept of aligning knowledge across languages in LLMs through self-consistency checks is relatively innovative. While previous works have explored multilingual model training and knowledge transfer, the CALM framework employs a unique approach by initially sampling responses and leveraging DPO for optimizing language alignment. This aspect marks a noteworthy contribution to the field, as it specifically addresses cross-lingual performance disparities, which remain a significant challenge in multilingual NLP. **Significance**:  The significance of this work is underscored by the ongoing interest in improving LLMs' cross-lingual capabilities, given the increasing prevalence of these models in applications that require cultural sensitivity and linguistic versatility. The effectiveness demonstrated on two benchmark datasets (MEDQA and X-CSQA) suggests practical applicability and relevance within the realm of multilingual question answering. **Strengths**:  - The paper’s experimental results are robust, illustrating effective performance improvements across various languages and conditions. - The qualitative analysis provides additional insights into the mechanisms by which cross-lingual consistency influences knowledge alignment, enhancing the understandability of the results. - The availability of the code and datasets further supports reproducibility and community advancement. **Weaknesses**:  - While the paper presents solid results, it could benefit from a broader evaluation across more languages and a more extensive range of question types to ascertain the method's generalizability and robustness. - The reliance on self-consistency alone might overlook cases where nuanced cultural differences lead to varying interpretations of questions, which could limit the applicability of CALM in some contexts. - More discussion on limitations and potential biases introduced by the training data across different languages would strengthen the paper's scholarly rigor. ### Conclusion Considering the paper’s contributions to the field, its innovative approach to a pressing issue in multilingual NLP, and the solid empirical validation of claims, it scores relatively highly. However, the need for broader applicability and deeper exploratory analysis limits its impact slightly. **Score: 8**
