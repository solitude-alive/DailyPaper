- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the increasing importance of organizing scholarly knowledge due to the rapid growth of published articles. It highlights traditional challenges in transforming unstructured knowledge from scholarly articles into structured, semantically rich formats, historically requiring considerable human intervention. The authors propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent user interfaces that assist in this transformation, enhancing existing scholarly knowledge infrastructures. They share insights from their integration of LLMs into these interfaces, including best practices and encountered obstacles, and conclude with a small-scale evaluation involving domain experts to assess the effectiveness of their approach. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its application of LLMs to enhance user interfaces for scholarly knowledge organization, which is a relatively innovative approach in the context of information retrieval and data curation. By addressing the gulf between unstructured text and structured knowledge representation, the paper presents a timely contribution to the fields of natural language processing and scholarly communication. However, the paper does have some limitations. While it proposes a practical integration strategy and reports on experiences, the details of these integrations and the evaluation methodologies lack depth. The user evaluation appears small-scale and may not be sufficient to substantiate broader claims about the effectiveness and generalizability of the LLM-supported components. Additionally, the obstacles encountered during LLM integration are minimally addressed, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the practical challenges. The significance of the research is notable as it connects advanced artificial intelligence techniques with tangible applications in scholarly communication, an area ripe for innovation. However, the abstract and results would benefit from clearer exposition on how their findings can influence future work in the field and whether such integrations could reshape scholarly practices on a larger scale. In summary, while the paper provides a fresh perspective on utilizing LLMs for creating intelligent user interfaces, it does not fully capitalize on its potential impact due to limitations in evaluation scope and depth. **Score: 6**
- **Abstract**: The number of published scholarly articles is growing at a significant rate, making scholarly knowledge organization increasingly important. Various approaches have been proposed to organize scholarly information, including describing scholarly knowledge semantically leveraging knowledge graphs. Transforming unstructured knowledge, presented within articles, to structured and semantically represented knowledge generally requires human intelligence and labor since natural language processing methods alone typically do not render sufficient precision and recall for many applications. With the recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly possible to provide truly intelligent user interfaces guiding humans in the transformation process. We present an approach to integrate non-intrusive LLMs guidance into existing user interfaces. More specifically, we integrate LLM-supported user interface components into an existing scholarly knowledge infrastructure. Additionally, we provide our experiences with LLM integration, detailing best practices and obstacles. Finally, we evaluate the approach using a small-scale user evaluation with domain experts.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces TokenVerse, a novel framework for multi-concept personalization using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. TokenVerse can successfully disentangle intricate visual elements from a single image, allowing users to generate new images that combine concepts derived from multiple images. The key innovation is the utilization of a DiT-based T2I model where text input influences the image generation process through attention and modulation techniques. The authors note that their modulation space is semantic, providing localized control over various complex concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, poses, and lighting. The framework functions by optimizing the relationship between image input and text descriptions to map specific words to distinct directions in this modulation space, effectively allowing for the generation of personalized images. The effectiveness of TokenVerse is demonstrated in challenging personalization scenarios, outperforming existing methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of TokenVerse lies in its approach to handling multiple images that can embody multiple concepts, which is a notable advancement over previous methods. This ability to combine and modulate concepts semantically and effectively through a pre-trained model suggests significant potential for fine-tuned personalization in image generation. Additionally, the identification of distinct directions for different concepts in the modulation space is a progressive step that may inspire future research in T2I tasks and personalized content creation. However, while the technical advances are impressive, the paper may not sufficiently explore the limitations of the method or its applicability in real-world scenarios. For example, while the framework claims to provide localized control, it remains to be seen how it performs in a broader range of contexts or with more complex scenes that may not fit neatly into the defined modulation categories. Furthermore, the practical usability of the method needs clarification, including the computational efficiency and the resources required for leveraging such a framework in everyday applications. In terms of impact, the paper seems to be positioned well within the evolving field of AI-driven image generation, particularly with increasing demand for personalized content across various platforms. However, it would benefit from a deeper discussion of future work or potential challenges that may arise in extending the framework. In summary, the strengths of TokenVerse include its innovative approach to multi-concept personalization and the practical utility demonstrated through its application. However, the paper somewhat under-reports the challenges and future directions necessary for broader implementation. Based on these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of 8. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: We present TokenVerse -- a method for multi-concept personalization, leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our framework can disentangle complex visual elements and attributes from as little as a single image, while enabling seamless plug-and-play generation of combinations of concepts extracted from multiple images. As opposed to existing works, TokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports a wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and lighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input text affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and scale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized control over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an optimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text description, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation space. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine the learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and showcase its advantages over existing methods. project's webpage in https://token-verse.github.io/

### **[CDW-CoT: Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12226v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuanheng Fang, Guoqing Chao, Wenqiang Lei, Shaobo Li, Dianhui Chu
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning (CDW-CoT), a novel method aimed at enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting methods tend to employ a uniform set of prompts for an entire dataset, which may not effectively address the diverse needs presented by different instances within the dataset. CDW-CoT overcomes this limitation by clustering the dataset to identify distinct groups and tailoring prompt construction to reflect characteristics specific to each group. The method trains a prompt probability distribution for each cluster and dynamically selects prompts for individual test instances based on their proximity to cluster centers. The evaluation shows that CDW-CoT significantly outperforms standard CoT techniques, with notable accuracy improvements on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**:  CDW-CoT introduces a new paradigm in approaching CoT prompting by integrating clustering and prompt optimization, which is a distinct advancement from traditional uniform prompt strategies. By recognizing the diversity within datasets and tailoring prompts accordingly, the authors exhibit a nuanced understanding that has the potential to drive improvements in the application of LLMs. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The combination of clustering and distance-weighted selection of prompts represents a creative solution to address the limitations of generic CoT methods. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The thorough experimentation across six diverse datasets bolsters the claims made, providing robust evidence of effectiveness. 3. **Significant Results**: The reported accuracy improvements over both standard CoT and manual prompting illustrate the potential for practical application and real-world relevance. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Clustering Limitations**: The effectiveness of clustering methods can vary significantly based on the underlying algorithm and parameters chosen, which may limit the approach if certain datasets are difficult to cluster effectively. 2. **Generalizability**: While promising results are shown, the paper does not discuss the applicability of CDW-CoT across different domains extensively, which raises questions about its generalizability. 3. **Complexity**: The added complexity of implementing clustering and customizing prompts may pose challenges in terms of scalability and ease of use, especially for practitioners without extensive ML backgrounds. **Impact**: The contribution of CDW-CoT is relevant and significant, as it could set a precedent for developing more context-sensitive reasoning frameworks in LLMs. This can lead to improved performance in applications requiring nuanced understanding, although its adaptation by the broader community will depend on overcoming the cited weaknesses. **Score**: 8 This score reflects the paper's considerable novelty and potential impact on the field of LLMs and reasoning tasks while acknowledging its limitations regarding clustering and generalizability, which leave room for further research and refinement.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in complex reasoning tasks through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. However, most existing CoT methods rely on using the same prompts, whether manually designed or automatically generated, to handle the entire dataset. This one-size-fits-all approach may fail to meet the specific needs arising from the diversities within a single dataset. To solve this problem, we propose the Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain of Thought (CDW-CoT) method, which dynamically constructs prompts tailored to the characteristics of each data instance by integrating clustering and prompt optimization techniques. Our method employs clustering algorithms to categorize the dataset into distinct groups, from which a candidate pool of prompts is selected to reflect the inherent diversity within the dataset. For each cluster, CDW-CoT trains the optimal prompt probability distribution tailored to their specific characteristics. Finally, it dynamically constructs a unique prompt probability distribution for each test instance, based on its proximity to cluster centers, from which prompts are selected for reasoning. CDW-CoT consistently outperforms traditional CoT methods across six datasets, including commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically, when compared to manual CoT, CDW-CoT achieves an average accuracy improvement of 25.34% on LLaMA2 (13B) and 15.72% on LLaMA3 (8B).

- **Abstract**: The improved competence of generative models can help building multi-modal virtual assistants that leverage modalities beyond language. By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.

### **[FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12243v1)**
- **Authors**: Yizhou Liu, Ziming Liu, Jeff Gore
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme" explores methods to enhance the pre-training of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations found in existing optimizers such as Adam when faced with gradient noise. The authors hypothesize that the loss landscape during pre-training behaves like a narrowing valley, where noise levels can significantly impact optimization performance. Experiments with synthetic loss functions reveal that under conditions of high gradient query noise, Adam's reduction of effective step size contributes to suboptimal performance compared to the Signum optimizer. To address this issue, the authors introduce FOCUS, an optimizer that combines features from Signum with an attraction mechanism towards moving average parameters, promoting larger step sizes while maintaining stability in the presence of noise. Their empirical results, particularly in training GPT-2, show that FOCUS outperforms Signum in stability and is faster than Adam. The findings encourage further investigation into the role of gradient noise in LLM training. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty:** 1. **Innovative Approach to Noise Handling:** The introduction of FOCUS represents a significant innovation by combining the strengths of existing optimization techniques (Signum and Adam) while also addressing a notable gap regarding gradient noise. 2. **Experimental Insights:** The use of synthetic loss functions to investigate optimizer performance under varying conditions of noise adds a unique dimension to the understanding of how different optimizers behave, which is not commonly addressed in the literature. **Significance:** 1. **Potential Impact on LLM Training:** By postulating that gradient noise is an underappreciated factor in the performance of optimizers, the paper opens avenues for future research that could lead to more efficient training approaches for LLMs. 2. **Practical Applications:** The demonstration of FOCUSâs effectiveness, particularly with a widely-used model like GPT-2, indicates practical implications for trainers and researchers in improving performance and stability in various machine learning applications. **Strengths:** - The alignment of theoretical insights with empirical results enhances the validity of the proposed method. - Clear motivation and justification for exploring new optimization strategies in LLM training, rooted in established concepts. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper discusses the implications of gradient noise, it could provide a more detailed analysis of varying noise levels in real-world scenarios, beyond the synthetic benchmarks. - Additional comparisons with other emerging optimizers and more extensive experiments on different models would strengthen the claims made about performance improvements. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field, particularly for those involved in the optimization challenges of LLMs. Its combination of theoretical exploration, empirical validation, and focus on a relevant problem makes it a meaningful addition to current research. **Score: 8**  ### Justification for the Score: The score of 8 reflects a robust contribution but acknowledges areas that could benefit from further elaboration and evidence. The novelty is significant in terms of exploring an often-overlooked aspect (gradient noise), and the results demonstrate clear performance benefits of the proposed optimizer, FOCUS. However, the paper could be strengthened by more comprehensive analysis and wider exploratory comparisons, which somewhat limit its overall impact. Therefore, while it provides a noteworthy step forward, there remains room for additional development and verification within the broader optimization landscape for LLMs.
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance, and improving their pre-training process appears to be key to enhancing their capabilities further. Based on the documented success of Adam, learning rate decay, and weight decay, we hypothesize that the pre-training loss landscape features a narrowing valley structure. Through experiments with synthetic loss functions, we discover that when gradient query noise is high relative to the valley's sharpness, Adam's performance falls behind that of Signum because Adam reduces the effective step size too drastically. This observation led us to develop FOCUS, an optimizer that enhances Signum by incorporating attraction toward moving averaged parameters, allowing it to handle noise better while maintaining larger step sizes. In training GPT-2, FOCUS proves to be more stable than Signum and faster than Adam. These results suggest that gradient noise may be an underappreciated limiting factor in LLM training, and FOCUS offers promising solutions.

### **[VipDiff: Towards Coherent and Diverse Video Inpainting via Training-free Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12267v1)**
- **Authors**: Chaohao Xie, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces VipDiff, a novel framework for video inpainting that employs training-free denoising diffusion models. Addressing the limitations of traditional video inpainting techniques that rely on optical flow for pixel propagation, VipDiff effectively handles large masked areas, which often suffer from artifacts due to the absence of pixel correspondences in their centers. This framework uniquely conditions diffusions on the reverse process, utilizing optical flow to extract valid pixels from reference frames. As a result, it optimizes randomly sampled Gaussian noise into temporally coherent inpainted outputs, allowing for diverse results by sampling different noise patterns. Experimental results indicate that VipDiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity in video inpainting. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  VipDiff presents an innovative approach by integrating diffusion models into video inpainting without requiring extensive training or fine-tuning, which is a notable departure from existing methods that necessitate predefined training data. The idea of conditioning the diffusion process utilizing optical flow for coherent results is also a fresh perspective, highlighting the interoperability of diffusion models with temporal constraints in video data. **Significance:**  The significance of VipDiff lies in its potential to alleviate common pitfalls in video inpaintingânamely, the generation of artifacts in regions where large areas need reconstruction. This addresses crucial practical challenges faced in video editing and restoration fields, potentially leading to applications in film post-production, archival video restoration, and real-time streaming enhancements. **Strengths:**  - The approach is innovative and leverages cutting-edge techniques in the realm of generative models without the burdensome requirements of training. - The focus on temporal coherence addresses a substantial gap in existing methods. - The experimental results provided are quantitative, showcasing significant improvements over current technologies. **Weaknesses:** - While the framework is compelling, the lack of a comprehensive training component may limit its application versatility compared to methods that can be fine-tuned for specific visual characteristics in different types of videos. - The paper could benefit from more qualitative assessments or comparisons, such as user studies, to confirm perceptions of fidelity beyond numerical results. - Depending on the experimental setup and random noise sampling, there may be limitations on the diversity of results, which warrants further exploration in various contexts. Based on these considerations, VipDiff is assessed as a notable contribution to the field of video inpainting, particularly in terms of addressing existing weaknesses in coherence and fidelity. However, the reliance on a purely training-free methodology may present long-term performance concerns in specialized applications. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent video inpainting methods have achieved encouraging improvements by leveraging optical flow to guide pixel propagation from reference frames either in the image space or feature space. However, they would produce severe artifacts in the mask center when the masked area is too large and no pixel correspondences can be found for the center. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating diverse and high-quality images, and have been exploited in a number of works for image inpainting. These methods, however, cannot be applied directly to videos to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, named VipDiff, for conditioning diffusion model on the reverse diffusion process to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models. VipDiff takes optical flow as guidance to extract valid pixels from reference frames to serve as constraints in optimizing the randomly sampled Gaussian noise, and uses the generated results for further pixel propagation and conditional generation. VipDiff also allows for generating diverse video inpainting results over different sampled noise. Experiments demonstrate that VipDiff can largely outperform state-of-the-art video inpainting methods in terms of both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity.

### **[Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12273v1)**
- **Authors**: Maosong Cao, Taolin Zhang, Mo Li, Chuyu Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Haodong Duan, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement" addresses the challenge of inadequately available high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for Large Language Models (LLMs) as they become increasingly sophisticated. The authors propose a two-stage synthetic data generation framework called Condor, which leverages a World Knowledge Tree and a Self-Reflection Refinement mechanism to create scalable, high-quality SFT data. Experimental results indicate that a base model fine-tuned on just 20,000 Condor-generated samples outperforms those trained on larger sets of traditional data. Furthermore, the paper highlights the iterative self-improvement potential of LLMs using the additional refinement stage, demonstrating effectiveness across different model sizesâup to 72 billion parameters. The authors also explore the significant but underutilized potential for performance enhancements through synthetic data post-training, suggesting interesting paths for future research. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its structured approach to synthetic data generation, specifically through its two intertwined componentsâWorld Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement. By explicitly addressing the current bottleneck of human-annotated data, the framework has the potential to significantly mitigate this issue in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs. The claim that models fine-tuned on Condor data can outperform those with traditional data configurations at small scales presents not only a practical advancement but also an intriguing method to maximize the use of synthetic data. However, while the methods proposed appear innovative, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous comparison with existing synthetic data generation techniques, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or traditional augmentation methods. Without sufficient benchmarks against these methods, it may be challenging to ascertain the absolute efficacy of Condor over prior approaches. Moreover, the scope of the experiments could be expanded to include a more varied set of tasks to fully validate the generalizability of their findings. Another point to consider is the potential risk of reliance on synthetic data, particularly regarding biases and misalignments that can arise from inadequate modeling of complex human language and knowledge structures. Such issues, while recognized in the paper, warrant a more detailed discussion on the implications of using synthetics extensively. In conclusion, Condor presents a significant contribution to the field by introducing a scalable method for generating high-quality synthetic data, with possibilities for iterative self-improvement in LLMs. Its promise is tempered, however, by the need for deeper analysis against existing frameworks and potential challenges in applicability. Given these strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of 7. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as LLMs become more advanced, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.

### **[MoGERNN: An Inductive Traffic Predictor for Unobserved Locations in Dynamic Sensing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12281v1)**
- **Authors**: Qishen Zhou, Yifan Zhang, Michail A. Makridis, Anastasios Kouvelas, Yibing Wang, Simon Hu
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MoGERNN, a novel inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model designed for predicting traffic states in partially observed road networksâa scenario where sensor coverage is limited due to financial constraints. Traditional traffic prediction models often require extensive retraining when sensor setups change and typically assume complete sensor data, which is unrealistic in practice. MoGERNN tackles these challenges by incorporating the Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block, which uses multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network to effectively model complex spatial relationships. This approach estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are further refined through a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates spatial and temporal dependencies for predicting future traffic states. The effectiveness of MoGERNN was validated through experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms baseline methods in traffic prediction, including in areas without sensors, thereby enhancing its utility for traffic management. The model also adapts well to changing sensor networks, maintaining performance comparable to retrained alternatives. Ablation studies affirm the contributions of its critical components to overall predictive performance. **Critical Evaluation and Score:** **Novelty and Contribution:** MoGERNN presents a meaningful advancement in the field of traffic prediction, particularly for scenarios involving limited sensor availability. By integrating principles from Large Language Models through the Mixture of Experts paradigm into traffic modeling, it establishes a new approach that tackles the inherent challenges of sparsity in sensor data. This innovation potentially shifts the way researchers and practitioners approach traffic state predictions, emphasizing adaptability and efficiency. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Architecture:** The introduction of the MoGE block offers a fresh perspective on incorporating multiple data aggregators, which may significantly enhance predictive accuracy across diverse scenarios. 2. **Real-World Relevancy:** The focus on unobserved locations reflects a real-world challenge, making the model applicable and valuable for urban traffic management. 3. **Robust Testing:** The use of real-world datasets and comprehensive testing (including ablation studies) provides confidence in the model's performance and reliability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization Limitations:** While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on two datasets, it remains uncertain how well the model generalizes across various urban environments and sensor configurations that were not explored. 2. **Model Complexity:** The incorporation of multiple components increases the modelâs complexity, which may lead to challenges in deployment and real-time application. 3. **Assessment of Scalability:** The paper does not extensively address how the model scales with significantly larger networks or with more dynamic changes in sensor setups. **Overall Assessment:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of traffic prediction by addressing practical limitations associated with sensor availability and model retraining. However, the model's generalizability and complexity could be further explored in future work. Nonetheless, the advancements made by MoGERNN represent a noteworthy step in improving traffic management systems through innovative modeling techniques. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Given a partially observed road network, how can we predict the traffic state of unobserved locations? While deep learning approaches show exceptional performance in traffic prediction, most assume sensors at all locations of interest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, these methods typically require costly retraining when sensor configurations change. We propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model, to address these challenges. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts approach in Large Language Models, we introduce a Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block to model complex spatial dependencies through multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network. This block estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are then processed by a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates a graph message aggregator to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict future states. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNN consistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobserved locations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areas without sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management. Moreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintaining competitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart. Tests with different numbers of available sensors confirm its consistent superiority, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of its key modules.

- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to curriculum modeling in personalized higher education by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion. The authors argue that effective learning personalization requires a thorough understanding of domain models and learning contexts. By linking university subjects and their topics to domain models, they aim to create a cohesive learning path that integrates modules across different faculties. The methodology involves a collaborative process where LLMs aid experts in extracting detailed educational content from lecture materials. The authors develop comprehensive models that encompass domain, curriculum, and user aspects, specifically implementing their approach in two modules related to Embedded Systems. The study evaluates the constructed KG through expert validation and graph quality metrics, demonstrating that their method significantly enhances interdisciplinary course connections for personalized learning experiences. Feedback from domain experts indicates a strong acceptance of the proposed approach for concept extraction and classification. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper asserts a unique application of LLMs in enhancing knowledge graph completion for higher education curriculum modeling, which is a relatively underexplored area. Traditionally, curriculum design has relied heavily on expert knowledge without leveraging computational methods to connect disparate topics across domains. By integrating LLMs in this process, the approach demonstrates an innovative blend of technology and pedagogy that is timely and relevant in today's educational landscape. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to reshape the personalization of learning paths in higher education. The creation of a comprehensive KG linking various disciplines can facilitate tailored educational experiences, possibly improving student engagement and retention. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the model development highlights the potential for stakeholder involvement, which is critical for the acceptance and effectiveness of educational technologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of LLMs with expert human curation presents a fresh perspective on curriculum design. 2. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: The ability to connect courses across faculties promotes an integrated educational approach, which is increasingly relevant. 3. **Validation Framework**: The dual evaluation method (qualitative expert feedback and quantitative metrics) adds robustness to the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns**: While the model was developed for two specific modules, the scalability of this approach to larger academic programs or institutions is not discussed thoroughly. 2. **Dependence on Expert Input**: The reliance on human experts for concept extraction may introduce bias or limit the model's efficacy if expert perspectives are narrow or inconsistent. 3. **Limited Generalizability**: The findings, if only applied within the contexts of the two chosen modules, may not necessarily be applicable across all fields of higher education. In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the intersection of technology and education, with a focus on enhancing learning personalization. However, there are aspects related to scalability and generalizability that require further exploration. Overall, its forward-thinking integration of LLMs in education holds promise, yet demands more empirical validation across diverse contexts. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics.

- **Authors**: Thomas Walshe, Sae Young Moon, Chunyang Xiao, Yawwani Gunawardana, Fran Silavong
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration" addresses the challenge of acquiring high-quality labeled training data in machine learning, which is often expensive and time-consuming. The authors investigate the potential of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic data labeling, given the limitations and concerns associated with proprietary models like GPT-4. They introduce a novel approach called Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC), which focuses on using label schema dynamically during the labeling process. This technique allows the LLM to consider one label at a time, starting from the most relevant, thus improving performance in high-cardinality labeling tasks. The results indicate that RAC enhances labeling accuracy while balancing label quality and coverage, providing a viable solution for automating the labeling of internal datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several significant strengths. Firstly, the choice to explore open-source LLMs addresses crucial concerns regarding privacy and cost, which are barriers to the widespread application of advanced machine learning techniques in industry. The introduction of the RAC method represents a thoughtful innovation; by dynamically integrating label descriptions, the paper shifts away from traditional, less efficient methods of label classification that can struggle with high cardinality. However, the paper has some limitations. While the approach demonstrates improvements, the experimental details, such as the datasets used and metrics for evaluation, are not discussed in depth, which may impede reproducibility and limit the understanding of the method's applicability across different scenarios. Additionally, although the paper claims performance improvements, it would benefit from a stronger comparative analysis with existing methods to quantify the advantages more convincingly. The novelty of the study lies not only in the application of RAC but also in its broader implications for how LLMs can manage label integration in machine learning tasks. The concept of dynamically iterating through labels to enhance classification mirrors emerging trends towards more interactive and user-influenced AI systems. Overall, the paper has a meaningful impact on the field of automated machine learning and the use of LLMs for data labeling. Given the significant concerns it addresses, alongside its innovative approach, I would rate the paper as follows: **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to open-source LLM application and labeling methodologies while noting certain areas for improvement in clarity and comparative analysis. The work provides valuable insights and lays a foundation for further exploration in enhancing the efficacy of label integration in machine learning.
- **Abstract**: Acquiring labelled training data remains a costly task in real world machine learning projects to meet quantity and quality requirements. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.

### **[Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352v1)**
- **Authors**: Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Emily B. Fox
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a unifying framework for understanding various architectures used in sequence modeling through the lens of associative memory and regression at test-time. The authors argue that effective sequence models must have the capability for associative recall, which they show is linked to the ability to memorize input tokens. They analyze numerous contemporary architectures, such as linear attention models and state-space models, framing them as different strategies for performing test-time regression. The paper outlines three design choices that dictate an architecture's performance: the weight of associations, the nature of the regressor function, and the optimization method used. This approach not only provides insights into model design but also offers theoretical validation for existing methods, paving the way for advanced developments in sequence modeling. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's central thesis provides a significant contribution to the field by proposing a coherent framework that connects a variety of seemingly disparate sequence modeling techniques. The emphasis on associative memory as a key component in sequence modeling is innovative and highlights an often-overlooked aspect of model performanceârecall of learned inputs. One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to derive insights from existing models and establish connections that may inspire further research. The treatment of models like linear attention and softmax attention is particularly notable, as it contextualizes these methods within a broader theoretical framework. Additionally, the authors' introduction of regression as a critical function at test-time could stimulate new research directions aimed at more effective design principles. However, while the framework is unifying, it risks oversimplifying the complexities inherent in the design and behavior of advanced sequence models. Moreover, the empirical validation of the framework and its propositions could be stronger; the paper largely relies on theoretical underpinnings without detailed experiments to substantiate the claims regarding model performance or efficiency. The theoretical connections drawn in the paper, such as the justification for QKNorm, are valuable but could be built upon with more rigorous analytical or empirical studies. As a result, while the framework is promising, the actual application of it in new model development and real-world scenarios remains to be fully tested. In summary, while the paper articulates a compelling vision for understanding and integrating sequence models, the potential impact may be somewhat tempered by the need for more empirical grounding.  **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.

### **[Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1)**
- **Authors**: Yeounoh Chung, Gaurav T. Kakkar, Yu Gan, Brenton Milne, Fatma Ozcan
- **Classification**: cs.DB
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL" investigates how the extended context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically Google's gemini-1.5-pro, can enhance the natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) transformation task. NL2SQL is inherently complex due to the ambiguity of natural language questions and the precise requirements for SQL syntax in relation to complex data schemas. The authors explore various forms of contextual informationâincluding column example values, question and SQL pairs, user hints, and SQL documentationâto assess their impact on the model's performance and latency. This research is unique in its comprehensive analysis of how extended context and additional contextual elements contribute to accuracy and efficiency in NL2SQL tasks. The results indicate that the long-context capabilities of LLMs are effective, as demonstrated by a benchmark score of 67.41% on the BIRD dataset without needing finetuning or complex techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel exploration of the relationship between extended context usage in LLMs and the efficiency of NL2SQL generation. This is highly relevant due to the increasing importance of automated querying systems, especially with the growth of data-centric applications.  Strengths: 1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The exploration of long context in LLMs aligns with current trends in NLP and data querying, offering insights that reflect the advancements in model architecture and capabilities. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides a thorough examination of various types of contextual prompts, which could benefit further research and practical implementations in NL2SQL tasks. 3. **Strong Performance Results**: Achieving a 67.41% accuracy on the BIRD benchmark with minimal additional techniques is impressive and suggests significant potential for real-world applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Benchmark Comparisons**: While the BIRD benchmark is relevant, further comparisons with other NL2SQL benchmarks or datasets could strengthen the validity of the results and generalizability to different contexts. 2. **Lack of Finetuning Analysis**: The paper mentions the lack of finetuning and more sophisticated methods, which raises questions about the model's scalability and adaptability in different scenarios with more complex datasets. 3. **Potential Overlook of Complexity**: The simplifying assumption that longer context alone yields better results may overlook other crucial factors impacting model performance, such as the nature of the queries or inherent biases in data schema representations. Overall, while the paper provides valuable insights and has potential implications for the field, its empirical analysis feels somewhat limited in scope when considering the diverse nature of real-world NL2SQL applications. Given these points, I would rate the paper as a **7** out of 10.  **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.

### **[Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongjun Wang, Wonmin Byeon, Jiarui Xu, Jinwei Gu, Ka Chun Cheung, Xiaolong Wang, Kai Han, Jan Kautz, Sifei Liu
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), an innovative attention mechanism designed to address limitations faced by existing models in efficiently processing multi-dimensional, spatially coherent image data. Unlike conventional methods that transform multi-dimensional data into 1D sequences, GSPN retains 2D spatial structures and deploys a line-scan approach to establish dense pairwise connections. This mechanism implements the Stability-Context Condition to maintain stable, context-aware data propagation, effectively reducing the sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for square maps, thereby improving computational efficiency. The GSPN operates with learnable, input-dependent weights and eliminates the need for positional embeddings, resulting in enhanced spatial fidelity. Its performance outstrips current standards in several vision tasks, exemplified by accelerated generation in SD-XL models by more than 84 times for 16K image outputs. **Critical Evaluation:** The introduction of GSPN marks a notable advancement in the field of attention mechanisms, particularly for vision tasks where spatial coherence is crucial. The emphasis on maintaining 2D spatial structures while reducing computational demands presents a compelling challenge to traditional transformer models that typically flatten data for processing. The Stability-Context Condition represents a novel conceptual framework that aims to optimize propagation across 2D sequences, which could inspire further research into context-aware models for various applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** GSPN introduces a fundamentally new way to approach attention mechanisms that can directly benefit tasks uniquely tied to spatial representational fidelity. 2. **Computational Efficiency:** The significant reduction in effective sequence length and improved speed for high-resolution image generation highlights GSPN's practical advantages, potentially enabling faster workflows in real-world applications. 3. **Performance Metrics:** Achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse vision tasks lends credibility to the methodologies adopted and underscores the competitive edge of GSPN over prior models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While GSPN shows promise, how it scales with even larger datasets or more intricate tasks remains an open question. The multi-fold increase in computational performance should be weighed against potential complexities arising from its dense connection strategy. 2. **Dependence on Specific Context:** The reliance on the Stability-Context Condition may pose challenges in varied applications with highly dynamic spatial relationships; additional empirical evidence across a broader spectrum of tasks would strengthen its validity. 3. **Comparison with Existing Models:** While claimed improvements in specific tasks are impressive, a more exhaustive comparison against contemporary models in diverse settings and datasets would provide a better insight into its overall effectiveness. This paper represents a substantial contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision. Its novel approach could inspire future research, although the practical implications of broader applications still need to be evaluated. Given the strengths and room for further validation, I assign a score of 8. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a new attention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2D spatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linear attention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as 1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomes these limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data and forming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central to GSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-aware propagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and no reliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity and state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNet classification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation. Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ when generating 16K images.

- **Authors**: Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Sihui Ji, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces **DiffDoctor**, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to enhance image diffusion models by reducing the production of artifacts. The first stage involves creating a robust artifact detection system, supported by a dataset of over 1 million flawed synthesized images and an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation strategy that ensures a balanced representation of defects. The second stage integrates the developed artifact detector to generate per-pixel confidence maps for the image generation process, allowing for more focused refinement of the diffusion model. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments that their approach effectively reduces artifacts in text-to-image diffusion models, supporting the proposed diagnose-then-treat paradigm. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The novelty of DiffDoctor lies in its dual approachâfirst diagnosing the specific locations of artifacts and then treating them rather than relying solely on holistic quality assessments. This targeted methodology is a marked advancement over existing strategies that do not account for spatial variations in defects. Additionally, the creation of a large dataset specifically for artifact detection contributes to the field by providing necessary resources for development and evaluation. **Significance:** In the context of the rapidly evolving field of image synthesis, as seen with the growing interest in diffusion models, producing cleaner images is paramount. The proposed methodology addresses a significant issueâartifactsâthat hinder the full potential of these technologies in practical applications. By introducing a systematic process for detecting and correcting defects, DiffDoctor could enhance the reliability of image generation tools, which may lead to wider adoption in various fields such as gaming, film, and virtual reality. **Strengths:** - The large-scale dataset and human-in-the-loop annotation process are well-conceived and likely to yield high-quality training for the artifact detection model. - The rigorous experimental setup provides compelling evidence for the proposed method's effectiveness, enhancing confidence in the results. **Weaknesses:** - The study focuses exclusively on text-to-image diffusion models, which may limit the general applicability of the findings to other diffusion tasks or models. - The potential computational overhead introduced by the two-stage process may raise concerns about efficiency and feasibility in real-time applications. **Potential Influence:** Given the growing importance of mitigating artifacts in image synthesis, DiffDoctor could set a precedent for future research focused on defect identification and correction in generative models. It highlights the importance of not only generating high-quality images but also understanding and managing the failures of these models. **Score: 8** This score reflects a balanced view of the paper's contributions and limitations. While indeed innovative and addressing a relevant problem within the field of image diffusion models, there remains a gap in applicability across various contexts and model types that future research will need to address. The strong methodological approach and the potential impact on the domain bolster its overall significance, yet further generalization and efficiency improvements would enhance its utility.
- **Abstract**: In spite of the recent progress, image diffusion models still produce artifacts. A common solution is to refine an established model with a quality assessment system, which generally rates an image in its entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to tune the diffusion model through assigning a per-pixel confidence map for each synthesis. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.

### **[Audio Texture Manipulation by Exemplar-Based Analogy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12385v1)**
- **Authors**: Kan Jen Cheng, Tingle Li, Gopala Anumanchipalli
- **Classification**: cs.SD
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel method for audio texture manipulation using an exemplar-based analogy model. Rather than relying on text-based commands, the technique utilizes pairs of audio clips: one representing the original sound and another exemplifying the desired transformation. The model is designed to learn this transformation and apply it to new inputs, successfully enabling various modifications to audio textures. A curated quadruplet dataset was created for different editing tasks, and the authors trained a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised way. Evaluation results, both quantitative and perceptual, demonstrate that this approach exceeds the performance of traditional text-conditioned models and can adapt to real-world and non-speech scenarios. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its shift from conventional text-based audio manipulation to a more intuitive and example-driven approach. This is significant because audio manipulation often struggles with subjective interpretations of text-based instructions, leading to less effective or less controllable outputs. By using audio pairs, the model allows for clearer transformation guidance, potentially making it more user-friendly and applicable in practical scenarios, such as sound design and music production. One strength of the paper is its emphasis on a self-supervised learning paradigm, which enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse audio domains. This is particularly relevant given the abundance of unlabeled audio data available. Additionally, the construction of a quadruplet dataset for training highlights the authors' approach to addressing the complexity of audio transformations, which may not map neatly to textual representations. However, there are also several weaknesses and areas for improvement. The scope of the evaluation could benefit from a larger variety of conditions and scenarios beyond speech, particularly concerning different genres of music or environmental sounds. Moreover, while the paper claims to outperform existing models, the specific metrics used for comparison and the extent of this performance gap should be detailed with clearer visualizations to substantiate the claims made, thus reinforcing the arguments presented. Furthermore, the direct applicability and computational efficiency of the model in real-time scenarios remain to be assessed, an essential factor for broader adoption in production environments. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insight into a potentially transformative method for audio manipulation, balancing novelty with practical applications. However, due to the current limitations in evaluation scope and depth, as well as a lack of extensive comparative analysis, I assign the following score: Score: 7
- **Abstract**: Audio texture manipulation involves modifying the perceptual characteristics of a sound to achieve specific transformations, such as adding, removing, or replacing auditory elements. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based analogy model for audio texture manipulation. Instead of conditioning on text-based instructions, our method uses paired speech examples, where one clip represents the original sound and another illustrates the desired transformation. The model learns to apply the same transformation to new input, allowing for the manipulation of sound textures. We construct a quadruplet dataset representing various editing tasks, and train a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised manner. We show through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies that our model outperforms text-conditioned baselines and generalizes to real-world, out-of-distribution, and non-speech scenarios.

The novel use of dense annotations and adaptive token compression represents a useful contribution to the field. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The demonstration of improved performance benchmarks lends credibility to the proposed methods. The results showing a sixfold increase in input memory are particularly significant, indicating a substantial advancement in the modelâs capabilities. 3. **Potential for Further Research**: By emphasizing multimodal context richness, the paper opens pathways for future explorations in video understanding and MLLM architectures. However, there are some weaknesses to consider: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results are compelling, a more rigorous comparative analysis with other leading MLLM frameworks could strengthen the paper by positioning the contributions more clearly against existing state-of-the-art models. 2. **Generalizability**: The focus on specific benchmarks may limit the perceived robustness of the findings. It would benefit the authors to validate their model across a broader set of datasets and tasks to ensure versatility in diverse real-world applications. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The methods proposed, given their innovative nature, may introduce computational complexity that could hinder practical application. A discussion on computational trade-offs and efficiency could further substantiate the impact of their work.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation" explores the utility of GPS data embedded in photo metadata as a control signal for generating images. The authors train models that convert GPS coordinates into images, particularly focusing on a diffusion model that generates images conditioned on both GPS locations and text. This allows for the generation of images that authentically reflect the unique characteristics of different city neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. Furthermore, the study details a method for extracting three-dimensional models from the two-dimensional GPS-to-image outputs by employing score distillation sampling, accentuating how GPS conditioning facilitates the quality of reconstructed images from various viewpoints. Evaluations demonstrate that the models infused with GPS data are adept at producing location-specific images and enhancing the accuracy of estimated 3D structures. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper presents a compelling novel approach by integrating GPS data with image generation processes through a diffusion model. While the application of GPS in image modeling has been touched upon in previous studies, the authors add value by demonstrating how GPS can serve as a control signal for generating highly localized images and reconstructing 3D structures. The combination of text and GPS data to condition image generation creates a new avenue for high-fidelity synthetic media that reflects real-world variations, which is a significant contribution. **Significance:** The significance lies in the practical implications of the research, especially in fields such as urban planning, tourism, and virtual simulations, where realistic representations of varying locales are essential. The ability to generate images that accurately convey the essence of different geographic areas opens new possibilities for user-guided imagery and interactive applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of diffusion models for conditioning on GPS and text is an innovative approach that can inspire future research. 2. **Multidimensional Output:** The ability to extract 3D models from the generated images is a noteworthy advancement that goes beyond image generation to spatial representation. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The evaluation results suggest that the models effectively learn location-based characteristics, providing solid empirical support for the claims made. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Contextual Application:** While the results are promising, the application seems primarily urban-centric, which could limit broader generalizability to diverse environments (e.g., rural areas) where GPS data may not carry the same significance. 2. **Complexity of Model Training:** The addition of GPS and text as conditioning elements may complicate the model training process, requiring substantial computational resources and potentially influencing accessibility for broader research engagement. 3. **Lack of Wider Comparisons:** The paper could improve its impact by comparing its outcomes directly to other state-of-the-art techniques in the image generation field, thereby contextualizing its contributions more sharply. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution by addressing an innovative intersection of geographical information systems and image generation technologies. It enhances depth in understanding spatial variations through data-driven methodologies, suggesting potential future avenues for applied research. However, the limitations in broader applicability and direct comparative evaluations weaken the impact somewhat. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovative aspect and practical significance, while also acknowledging the limitations in scope and comparative analysis, which are essential for positioning advancements within an evolving research landscape.
- **Abstract**: We show that the GPS tags contained in photo metadata provide a useful control signal for image generation. We train GPS-to-image models and use them for tasks that require a fine-grained understanding of how images vary within a city. In particular, we train a diffusion model to generate images conditioned on both GPS and text. The learned model generates images that capture the distinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. We also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillation sampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of the reconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that our GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Towards Affordance-Aware Articulation Synthesis for Rigged Objects" addresses the challenge of articulating rigged objects in a way that is both realistic and context-sensitive. These objects, prevalent in the artistic and animation pipelines, can be difficult to pose naturally without extensive input from skilled artists. The authors introduce a novel system called A3Syn, which automates the synthesis of articulation parameters for various rigged objects based on specific contexts defined by environment meshes and text prompts. A3Syn employs a 2D inpainting diffusion model and advanced control techniques to generate affordance-aware postures. It also innovates a robust bone correspondence alignment approach using differentiable rendering and semantic matching. The process is designed to operate efficiently, delivering results in minutes without the need for extensive training data or rigid topological constraints on the rigs used. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The paper makes several notable contributions to the field of computer graphics and animation. The approach of synthesizing articulation based on environmental context and affordance awareness is quite innovative, addressing a significant limitation in current rigged object manipulation systems. The use of a 2D inpainting diffusion model for generating complex poses is a fresh perspective that suggests potential for broader applications beyond the specific case of rigged objects. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach**: The integration of inpainting diffusion models and the lack of strict topological assumptions represent a significant advancement. This opens doors for more flexible and varied applications in animations and simulations. 2. **Efficiency**: The ability of A3Syn to produce results within minutes while maintaining stability and plausibility in output is a strong advantage, particularly in high-demand creative environments. 3. **Broad Applicability**: The systemâs compatibility with a wide range of rigged objects found online enhances its practical relevance and usability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Training Data Limitations**: The claim of operating with limited training data, while ambitious and beneficial, may lead to challenges in the robustness of the models, especially in edge cases where unique rig variations are presented. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could fall short regarding the quantitative evaluation of the synthesized articulations; stronger metrics could reinforce claims about convergence and plausibility. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: There is minimal discussion on how A3Syn compares to existing methods in terms of both qualitative output and computational efficiency, which could leave some questions around its relative performance. **Potential Influence**: This work has the potential to significantly impact fields such as game design, animation, and virtual reality, where the need for dynamic and realistic representations of objects is increasing. If the methodologies presented in A3Syn are adopted and further developed, they could change the landscape of rigged object utilization in these areas. ### Conclusion Overall, while the paper presents a compelling foundation and a clear advancement in affordance-aware articulation for rigged objects, it has room for improvement in terms of validation and comparative analysis. Its innovative aspect, particularly with the synthesis methods and operational efficiency, however, positions it as a noteworthy contribution to the field of computer graphics. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Rigged objects are commonly used in artist pipelines, as they can flexibly adapt to different scenes and postures. However, articulating the rigs into realistic affordance-aware postures (e.g., following the context, respecting the physics and the personalities of the object) remains time-consuming and heavily relies on human labor from experienced artists. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem and design A3Syn. With a given context, such as the environment mesh and a text prompt of the desired posture, A3Syn synthesizes articulation parameters for arbitrary and open-domain rigged objects obtained from the Internet. The task is incredibly challenging due to the lack of training data, and we do not make any topological assumptions about the open-domain rigs. We propose using 2D inpainting diffusion model and several control techniques to synthesize in-context affordance information. Then, we develop an efficient bone correspondence alignment using a combination of differentiable rendering and semantic correspondence. A3Syn has stable convergence, completes in minutes, and synthesizes plausible affordance on different combinations of in-the-wild object rigs and scenes.

### **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v1)**
- **Authors**: Matthew Gwilliam, Han Cai, Di Wu, Abhinav Shrivastava, Zhiyu Cheng
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), an innovative method aimed at enhancing the inference speed of diffusion models. ILF introduces a lightweight module that predicts future features during the denoising process by using outputs from a specific block in the diffusion backbone at a particular time step. The method relies on two primary insights: that outputs from adjacent time steps are typically similar and that performing partial computations on a step is more efficient than completely skipping it. The feedback module can be based on any block from the diffusion backbone, with its effect modulated by a learnable scaling factor initialized to zero. ILF is trained using distillation losses, but unlike previous approaches, the backbone is kept frozen, focusing the training on the feedback module. The goal is to achieve high image quality in fewer steps while reducing runtime effectively. Empirical results demonstrate that ILF can significantly match the performance of diffusion models that require more steps while achieving 1.7x to 1.8x speedups based on metrics like FID, CLIP score, and qualitative assessments. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The Inner Loop Feedback methodology introduces an efficient mechanism to predict future features during the denoising process, which can be seen as a novel contribution in the realm of diffusion models. 2. **Practical Implications:** Reducing inference time while maintaining image quality is a significant challenge in the field. ILF demonstrates that this can be achieved by leveraging existing network structures creatively. 3. **Robust Testing:** The paper supports its claims with various quantitative metrics, such as FID and CLIP scores, providing a well-rounded validation of the proposed method's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Improvement:** While ILF does provide speed improvements, the extent to which it impacts broader applications or more complex diffusion models remains unclear. The paper does not sufficiently explore all potential environments where this technique may or may not apply. 2. **Assumption on Similarity:** The approach relies heavily on the assumption that outputs from adjacent steps are similar. While this may hold for many cases, exceptions could limit the approach's robustness. 3. **Interaction with Other Techniques:** The paper does not extensively discuss how ILF can be integrated with or benefit from existing acceleration techniques in diffusion models, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability. **Impact on the Field:** ILF's approach to deepening the understanding of the efficient use of feedback mechanisms in diffusion models may spur further research into optimizing inference speeds in other types of generative models. However, its adoption and relevance will highly depend on the community's reception and further corroboration through empirical testing in diverse scenarios. **Score Justification:** Assigning a score of 7 reflects the paper's notable innovation and practical contributions to the field, balanced with concerns regarding the limits of its assumptions and the potential for broader integration. It stands out for clarity and rigorous empirical evaluation, yet the need for wider applicability and consideration of the competitive landscape reduces the maximum impact score. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

- **Abstract**: Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.

- **Authors**: Xin Xu, Jiaxin Zhang, Tianhao Chen, Zitong Chao, Jishan Hu, Can Yang
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces UGMathBench, a new benchmark for assessing undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The benchmark consists of 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring varied answer types and multiple randomized versions of each problem. Two innovative metrics are proposed: effective accuracy (EAcc), which gauges the correctness of solved problems across all versions, and the reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which indicates the robustness of reasoning by representing the difference between average accuracy and EAcc. An evaluation of 23 prominent LLMs found that the highest EAcc was 56.3% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with notable $\Delta$ values signaling room for improvement. The authors aim for UGMathBench to facilitate future advancements in LLMs' mathematical problem-solving capabilities by providing a comprehensive testing framework. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution by identifying gaps in existing benchmarks for mathematical reasoning with LLMs and proposing UGMathBench as a solution. The scale and diversity of UGMathBench (covering 5,062 problems and multiple subjects) represent significant progress over previous benchmarks, which often lack comprehensive coverage or exhibit test-set contamination. The introduction of both EAcc and $\Delta$ metrics is particularly innovative as they provide nuanced insights into model performance beyond mere accuracy. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensiveness**: The large number of problems and subjects covered enhances the benchmark's applicability and relevance to undergraduate mathematical reasoning. 2. **Dynamic Nature**: The provision for multiple randomized problem versions and future expansion is a forward-thinking approach, addressing potential overfitting to a static dataset. 3. **Insightful Metrics**: EAcc and reasoning gap ($\Delta$) offer deeper evaluation criteria that prompt further understanding and research into LLM performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Baseline Performance**: While the paper reports the highest EAcc at 56.3%, this statistic alone may obscure broader performance trends or the challenge of achieving effective reasoning. The reasons for the varying performance across LLMs need closer examination. 2. **Generalizability**: Although UGMathBench focuses on undergraduate-level problems, its effectiveness in evaluating mathematical reasoning in other educational contexts or for different complexity levels remains untested. 3. **Future Work**: The paperâs call for "large reasoning models" implies a need for further development and exploration, but it lacks a clear roadmap or specific methodologies for achieving this within the context of the current limitations identified. **Overall Evaluation:** Despite its strengths, such as innovation in benchmarking and insightful metrics, the paper's complexity and implications may not be fully realizable until the dynamic nature of UGMathBench is put to the test against a broader spectrum of LLMs and educational settings. The novelty of using comprehensive sets of problems with dynamic versions is promising, and the preliminary results suggest ample room for improvement in LLMs' mathematical reasoning.  Considering these points, I would assign the paper a score of **8**, indicating a strong and significant contribution to the field with a well-defined methodology that challenges existing benchmarks and encourages innovative thinking for future LLM developments. Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.

### **[An Efficient Diffusion-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13767v1)**
- **Authors**: Mingzhao Wang, You Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yubin Xiao, Xuan Wu, Wei Pang, Yuan Jiang, Hui Yang, Peng Zhao, Yuanshu Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents DEITSP, an innovative diffusion-based model designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in a non-autoregressive (NAR) fashion. It addresses the common trade-off where NAR methods often lag in solution quality compared to autoregressive approaches while benefitting from faster inference times. DEITSP introduces a one-step diffusion model that enhances solution prediction through a process of controlled noise addition and self-consistency, allowing simultaneous denoising of multiple potential solutions. The model employs a dual-modality graph transformer for improved feature extraction and fusion, enhancing the inference efficiency with a leaner architecture. An iterative strategy is developed to optimize exploration by alternating noise addition and removal, complemented by a scheduling framework that progressively refines the solution space. Empirical results indicate that DEITSP outperforms other neural models on various TSP instances in terms of solution quality, speed, and generalization capabilities. **Evaluation**: The paper exhibits significant novelty due to its approach to integrating diffusion models in the context of TSP, particularly with an emphasis on NAR methodologies. The combination of a one-step diffusion process, dual-modality feature extraction, and iterative noise management reflects a comprehensive strategy that appears to effectively tackle the limitations of previous models in this domain. The application of controlled noise addition offers potential for improved exploration of the solution space, which is critical in combinatorial optimization scenarios like TSP. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The blending of diffusion models with NAR techniques provides a fresh perspective and could pave the way for subsequent research in related optimization fields. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments conducted against both real-world and large-scale instances bolster the credibility of the results and the proposed methods. 3. **Code Availability**: Providing access to the implementation encourages reproducibility and further experimentation by other researchers. However, certain aspects raise questions: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results show improvement over existing methods, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the limitations of autoregressive models and how DEITSP addresses these more directly. 2. **Generalizability**: The implications of the proposed method on problems beyond TSP or in different contexts are not thoroughly discussed, leaving uncertainty about the broader applicability. Given these observations, I assign a score of **8**. The paper marks a noteworthy contribution to the field by addressing a relevant problem with an innovative method that shows promise for better performance than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, more explorative comparisons and a discussion on the generalization of results could strengthen its impact and future applicability.  Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted engineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

While investigation into security issues surrounding text and vision-language models has been comprehensive, the effects of audio-specific edits on LALMs remain largely unexamined. This study addresses this gap by utilizing an Audio Editing Toolbox (AET) that allows modifications such as tone adjustments, word emphasis, and noise injection. The authors also introduce Edited Audio Datasets (EADs) as a new benchmark for assessing the influence of these audio edits. Through detailed evaluations of leading LALMs, the research assesses their robustness in the face of these manipulations, contributing foundational knowledge for future studies on audio interaction security in LALMs. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant and timely investigation into a relatively unexplored area of multimodal artificial intelligence, focusing on the security implications of LALMs. The introduction of the AET and EADs addresses a crucial need for tools and benchmarks in studying audio manipulability, thus expanding the existing literature beyond text and vision. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** By focusing explicitly on audio modalities in jailbreak contexts, this paper fills a critical gap in current research. It shifts attention from predominately text-oriented studies to an area that is increasingly relevant as audio-based applications grow. 2. **Methodology:** The proposal of both a toolbox and datasets specifically designed for audio edits represents a methodological advancement in the field, allowing for repeatable experiments that further validate the findings. 3. **Implications for Security:** Understanding how specific audio edits can exploit LALMs is an essential insight for developing models that are resilient to such manipulations, influencing research and practice in AI safety. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Technical Depth:** While the practical tools introduced (AET and EADs) are promising, the paper may benefit from a deeper technical analysis or case studies demonstrating tangible improvements in robustness based on the insights gained. 2. **Scope of Evaluation:** Outputs from LALMs should be scrutinized not only for robustness but also for qualitative aspects of harmfulness; a broader evaluation could enhance the paper's validity and practical relevance. 3. **Interdisciplinary Context:** The work could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the implications of audio edits compared to other modalities. This could aid in establishing a more comprehensive view of multimodal security. In light of these observations, the paper represents an important advancement in understanding the security risks associated with LALMs and lays a solid foundation for future research in the area. Although it has areas that could be improved, the novelty and timely emergence of this research justify a high score. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the geometric abilities of large language models (LLMs) and presents the GeomRel dataset, specifically designed to evaluate the understanding of geometric structures rather than merely the ability to arrive at correct answers. By concentrating on geometric relationship identification, the authors evaluate multiple LLMs and pinpoint significant gaps in their comprehension of spatial concepts. Additionally, the paper proposes the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) methodology, which improves LLM performance in identifying geometric relationships, demonstrating notable advancements in understanding spatial reasoning. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces several compelling contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in the understanding of geometry by LLMs. A novel aspect is the GeomRel dataset, which fills a critical gap in existing evaluations by focusing on the process of geometric reasoning rather than the correctness of answers alone. This alignment with deeper understanding fosters a more meaningful assessment of LLM capabilities. Furthermore, the GeoCoT method showcases a practical application designed to improve those capabilities, suggesting a route for future enhancements in model training and evaluation. However, there are some drawbacks that temper the paper's impact. The primary weakness lies in the evaluation methodology â while it identifies limitations in LLMs, it does not explore how these models can adaptively improve their geometric understanding beyond the GeoCoT framework. Moreover, the broader implications of these findings for LLM applications in real-world scenarios remain underexplored.  Overall, the research is novel in its premise and offers valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs with respect to geometry, suggesting potential pathways for development. The significance of the findings in fostering a better comprehension of spatial reasoning within LLMs and the introduction of a specialized dataset are noteworthy accomplishments. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, striking a balance between novelty and practical application, while recognizing the limitations and the need for further exploration in the domain of geometric understanding by language models.
- **Abstract**: Geometric ability is a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for advanced spatial comprehension and abstract thinking. Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.

- **Abstract**: We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.

### **[Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13779v1)**
- **Authors**: Tanya Rodchenko, Natasha Noy, Nino Scherrer, Jennifer Prendki
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling" argues that the influx of data needed for training Large Language Models (LLMs) should not be approached indiscriminately. Instead, researchers should prioritize specific tasks that are more likely to yield improvements from data scaling. The authors emphasize that the structure and topology of the data can guide this intentionality in data acquisition and suggest that understanding these factors will influence the development of future computational paradigms, especially for tasks where increasing data may not necessarily lead to better outcomes. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a compelling perspective on the growing reliance on data in AI, particularly in training LLMs. By advocating for a more strategic, topology-driven approach to data acquisition, it challenges the prevailing notion that simply accumulating more data will result in enhanced model performance. This notion has been implicit in much of the literature but not strongly articulated. This focus on the relationship between data structure and task efficiency represents a meaningful contribution to the discourse on data-driven AI development. **Significance:** The implications of this work extend to both academic research and practical applications in AI. By changing how researchers and practitioners think about data scaling and its relationship to task effectiveness, the paper could foster a paradigm shift in data acquisition strategies. It addresses an important gap where the sheer volume of data often overshadows qualitative considerations that could lead to more efficient model training processes. **Strengths:** - The paper effectively identifies a critical issue in the AI field: the often uncritical accumulation of large datasets. - It builds a theoretical framework around which tasks should be prioritized for data scaling, which could guide future research. - The discussion about the topology of data opens avenues for exploration into whether all data is equally useful across different tasks. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper poses valuable questions, it could benefit from concrete examples or case studies that illustrate its claims regarding efficient versus inefficient data scaling. - The methodology for assessing which tasks are computationally intensive and which are not is not fully fleshed out, limiting its practical applicability. - The paper might risk oversimplifying the challenges associated with data scaling by suggesting hierarchy without adequately addressing the complexities involved. Overall, while the theoretical foundation and practical implications of the paper are strong, the lack of empirical evidence and specific methodologies presents a limitation. The call for intentionality in data scaling is laudable but needs elaboration on how stakeholders can implement these ideas. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's significant conceptual contribution and potential impact on the field while recognizing its limitations in empirical grounding and practical guidance.
- **Abstract**: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the topology of data itself informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.

### **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction" focuses on improving mobile traffic prediction, which is critical for network optimization and urban planning. Given the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, caused by human behaviors and environmental changes, it often presents both predictable patterns and sudden fluctuations. While current methods emphasize the development of advanced denoising networks, the authors argue that understanding and effectively utilizing noise is equally vital for enhancing prediction accuracy. They introduce a new framework called NPDiff that distinguishes between noise as a prior component derived from data dynamics and residual noise. This separation allows NPDiff to better model the complexities of mobile traffic, leading to significant performance enhancements. Experimental results indicate that NPDiff surpasses previous models by over 30%, suggesting a potential shift in how diffusion models can be applied in this area of research. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Perspective on Noise:** The paper brings attention to a relatively unexplored aspect of mobile traffic predictionâthe role of noise as a contributing factor rather than merely a nuisance. This approach could inspire future research directions, potentially changing the foundational understanding of noise in predictive modeling. 2. **Framework Contribution:** The proposed NPDiff framework, which segments noise into prior and residual components, adds a new dimension to the functionality of diffusion models, making it a notable advancement in the field of network traffic prediction. 3. **Significant Performance Improvement:** The reported performance improvements of over 30% in predictive accuracy substantiate the proposed methodology, indicating a practical application of the theory and a strong validation of the authors' claims. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation:** The paper could benefit from a more robust theoretical underpinning explaining why treating noise in this way enhances predictive capability, particularly in comparison to traditional methods. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** While extensive experiments showcase superior performance, the results would be stronger with a broader comparison across various existing frameworks, ideally in multiple real-world scenarios, to contextualize the benefits of NPDiff comprehensively. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The practicality of implementing this novel approach at scale, particularly in real-time mobile traffic systems, remains uncertain and could be a subject of further exploration. ### Influence on the Field The paper contributes an innovative perspective on an established area, proposing an intriguing methodology that could influence the way researchers and practitioners approach mobile traffic prediction. By centering the discussion on the roles of noise, it opens avenues for future explorations and enhancements of diffusion models beyond the presented case. The significant improvements reported could also stimulate interest and subsequent studies focusing on similar noise-related dynamics across different domains. **Score:** 8 **Rationale for the Score:** The score of 8 reflects a solid contribution to the field, particularly with its novel emphasis on noise and impressive performance outcomes. However, the absence of a strong theoretical framework and limited comparative analysis limit its overall impact and applicability. The paper's approach is significant enough to warrant attention and inspire further research, yet there are areas for improvement and deeper exploration, which prevent it from achieving a perfect score.
- **Abstract**: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.

- **Classification**: cs.CY
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper examines the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in combating climate misinformation rather than exacerbating the issue. It assesses the performance of both proprietary and open-source LLMs in classifying climate misinformation using a well-annotated expert dataset and a selection of social media content. Key findings indicate that state-of-the-art open-source models significantly lag behind proprietary ones in this domain. Additionally, existing computer-assisted tools surpass several proprietary models in performance, including GPT-4o. Notably, fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert data allows it to achieve classification accuracy comparable to seasoned climate communication professionals. The study underscores the necessity of human oversight in training LLMs for governance roles, particularly in specialized fields like climate change, and suggests potential applications of LLMs for civil society in addressing misinformation across various domains. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper contributes meaningfully to the discourse on LLMs and their appropriateness for handling specialized tasks necessitating expert knowledge. Its innovative approach lies in the comparative analysis of proprietary and open-source models using an expert-annotated dataset, addressing a pressing concern regarding the implications of LLMs in misinformation.  **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The pressing issue of climate misinformation is increasingly critical in today's socio-political landscape. 2. **Methodology:** The use of expert-annotated datasets enhances the credibility of the results and directly addresses a gap in existing techniques by incorporating domain expertise. 3. **Practical Findings:** Demonstrating that fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance showcases the actionable nature of the research, which can influence both policy and technology development. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the study focuses on climate misinformation, the findings may not directly translate to other domains of misinformation, such as politics or health, as complexities differ. 2. **Limitations of Open-Source Models:** The study notes the performance gap without sufficiently exploring the innovative aspects of open-source models or their potential when adequately fine-tuned. 3. **Dependency on Human Oversight:** While human oversight is highlighted as beneficial, the paper could delve deeper into the challenges and logistics of maintaining and integrating such oversight into LLM training processes. **Overall Assessment:** Given the paper's substantial contributions to both the understanding of LLM capabilities in governance contexts and the methodologies for countering misinformation, it is a noteworthy work that raises critical questions and offers viable solutions. However, the limitations regarding generalization and depth of exploration of open-source potential reduce the impact somewhat. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Climate misinformation is a problem that has the potential to be substantially aggravated by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.

### **[Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13816v1)**
- **Authors**: Jie Wang, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Joemon M. Jose
- **Classification**: cs.IR
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems" addresses challenges faced by Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Recommender Systems (RS), specifically regarding distribution shifts and the balance between exploration and exploitation. It proposes a new approach called Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP), which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to pre-train offline policies based on user preferences. The method extracts item preferences from user states, learns rewards through user feedback, and updates the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. To enable effective online deployment, the paper introduces an adaptive version, A-iALP, consisting of fine-tuning (A-iALP$_{ft}$) and adaptive (A-iALP$_{ap}$) strategies aimed at resolving issues linked to unstable policies and insufficient exploration. Experimental results indicate that A-iALP significantly enhances performance across simulated environments. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of LLMs with RL-based RS to improve initial policy recommendations and address the inherent challenges of offline RL when placed in dynamic online environments. By focusing on user preference extraction through LLMs, the authors provide a fresh perspective on how to tackle exploration-exploitation trade-offs effectively. This is particularly significant due to the growing interest in utilizing LLMs in various domains. However, there are some potential weaknesses to consider. Firstly, the experiments are conducted in simulated environments, which may not fully capture the complexities and variability of real-world RS challenges. The performance improvements, though substantial in simulations, require further validation in practical implementations. Additionally, the paper does not deeply explore the limitations or computational costs associated with the proposed LLM augmentation methods, which could be significant when scaling to larger user bases. Overall, the paper contributes new methodologies to the field of RS and addresses critical issues that are prevalent in current systems. It opens avenues for further research on the combination of LLMs with RL. Considering these aspects, I assess the paper's novelty and significance as an 8. The approach is innovative and practical, but the dependency on simulated data and lack of exhaustive exploration of limitations might inhibit immediate applicability. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments. Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains. Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings. Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM. Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements

- **Authors**: Shuzhou Yuan, Michael FÃ¤rber
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery" explores the potential benefits of hallucinationsâunintended outputs not directly grounded in factual dataâproduced by large language models (LLMs) in the context of drug discovery. The authors hypothesize that these hallucinations can enhance the performance of LLMs on specific drug discovery tasks. They conducted an experiment utilizing seven different LLMs and five classification tasks, demonstrating that integrating hallucinated descriptions of molecular SMILES strings into LLM prompts leads to improved performance. Particularly, Llama-3.1-8B shows a significant 18.35% increase in ROC-AUC scores compared to a baseline devoid of hallucinations. The paper highlights GPT-4o's hallucinations as offering the most robust improvements. Additionally, the authors carried out empirical analyses and a case study to understand the nuances influencing model performance. The main contribution lies in demonstrating that, in certain creative domains like drug discovery, hallucinations from LLMs might not only be harmless but could also be advantageous. ### Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The paper challenges conventional views about hallucinations in LLMs, proposing that they can have a beneficial role in creative and exploratory tasks such as drug discovery. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide substantial empirical evidence supporting their hypothesis, showing measurable performance gains across multiple models and tasks. 3. **Relevance:** With the growing interest in utilizing AI for drug discovery, this research is timely and addresses a significant area within the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the paper shows improvements in specific tasks, the results may not generalize across all types of drug discovery or to other fields. The research is somewhat limited in scope. 2. **Mechanistic Understanding:** The paper lacks a robust theoretical framework explaining why hallucinations contribute to improved performance. More insight into the mechanisms by which these hallucinations enhance LLM functioning would strengthen the findings. 3. **Focus on Specific Models:** The analysis centers around a limited number of LLMs, which may lead to questions about the applicability of the findings to a broader array of models and methodologies in drug discovery. **Impact on the Field:** The implications of this research are significant, as it opens new avenues for utilizing LLMs in drug discovery, particularly in areas requiring innovative thought. If further validated, this could reshape how researchers view the role of hallucinations in AI applications, suggesting a model where, rather than merely being flagged as undesirable, such outputs could lead to creative breakthroughs. Considering the combination of its novel perspective, empirical basis, and relevance to a growing domain, while also acknowledging the limitations in terms of generalizability and mechanism derivation: **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons. Our research sheds light on the potential use of hallucinations for LLMs and offers new perspectives for future research leveraging LLMs in drug discovery.

### **[Predicting Compact Phrasal Rewrites with Large Language Models for ASR Post Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13831v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Zhang, Felix Stahlberg, Shankar Kumar
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for rewriting tasks, particularly focusing on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post-editing. It notes the inefficiencies inherent in decoding lengthy outputs despite potential overlaps between input and output, paralleling prior work by Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) that introduced model-agnostic edit span representations for compressing rewrites. The authors propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation, comparing their phrasal approach to the previous span representations. The findings demonstrate that their target-phrase-only edit representation achieves an efficient balance between accuracy and computational expense, illustrated by a 50-60% reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech test set compared to the span model, while maintaining a significant length reduction. **Evaluation:** The paper presents noteworthy contributions to the field of LLM applications in ASR post-editing. One of its key strengths lies in the novel approach of phrasal representations, which provide a viable alternative to existing span-based techniques. This represents an advancement in improving the efficiency of LLMs in rewriting tasks, crucial given the computational demand of larger models. However, while the modification and comparison are methodologically sound, the innovation may not be radically transformative; it builds upon prior work and may not introduce fundamentally new ideas beyond the adaptations from statistical machine translation principles. The paperâs actual contribution to the efficiency-accuracy trade-off could also benefit from more comprehensive quantitative evaluations across a wider range of datasets and tasks beyond LibriSpeech. The practical implications focus on improving efficiency in ASR systems. Still, the margin of improvement in WER could be seen as modest given the prominent challenges in ASR accuracy improvement across diverse applications, which may limit the immediate applicability of the findings. In summary, the paper offers a solid expansion of the body of knowledge regarding LLMs in ASR contexts, demonstrating clear applicability and improvement therein. Nonetheless, its reliance on adaptations of pre-existing concepts and potential limitations in broader applicability reduce its overall novelty. Thus, I assign a score of 7/10. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at rewriting tasks such as text style transfer and grammatical error correction. While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.

- **Authors**: Santosh Kumar Radha, Oktay Goktas
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It" addresses the ongoing discussion surrounding the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While these models perform well on various benchmarks, they struggle with complex reasoning tasks, prompting the authors to propose a new evaluation framework. This framework focuses on understanding the models' reasoning mechanisms beyond mere accuracy. The authors demonstrate this approach using positional bias in multiple-choice tasks, introducing two complementary models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that categorizes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing, and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis to quantify model confidence versus strategy selection. Their findings indicate that LLMs often fail to engage in true reasoning, relying instead on memorization and pattern matching. The paper calls for the use of quantitative criteria for evaluating AI applications, suggesting a need to define reliability thresholds in terms of cognitive strategy distributions rather than just performance metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions. Firstly, it identifies a significant gap in the existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs by highlighting their reasoning limitations. Furthermore, it proposes a novel phenomenological approach that encompasses a deeper analysis of model behavior through a mixture of theoretical models, which is a constructive step toward understanding reasoning in AI systems. In terms of novelty, the integration of PMM and ITC analysis offers a fresh perspective on how AI models operate, shedding light on their underlying mechanics. This dual approach is commendable and demonstrates an innovative method for dissecting model behavior in a rigorous manner, which is necessary for advancing AI evaluation. However, the paper does have its weaknesses. The implementation details of the proposed models might lack depth, which could hinder reproducibility and practical application. Additionally, while the authors emphasize the dual approach's theoretical impact, empirical results might be limited, and the discussions could benefit from a broader context of how these findings compare to existing methodologies in AI evaluation. Moreover, while the analysis focuses on reasoning, it could have included practical implications or case studies showcasing how this framework could be utilized in real-world scenarios, enhancing its relevance. Overall, despite these limitations, the paper's contribution is significant, as it provides a pathway for more nuanced assessments of AI reasoning capabilities, addressing a crucial area of research. Thus, while it may not be groundbreaking, it is an important advancement in the ongoing quest to demystify AI reasoning. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate surrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While achieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models exhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological approach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying mechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly impact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in multiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic perturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To analyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model confidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning benchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models, with apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's reasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying mechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models dynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This framework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing applications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions rather than aggregate performance metrics.

- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant" addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling knowledge-intensive tasks that require access to structured databases or specific document content. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model designed for the University of SÃ£o Paulo, which combines a retriever module and a generative model. The study experimentally evaluates various models for both components and optimizes hyperparameters, achieving a Top-5 accuracy of 30% for the retriever and 22.04% for the generative model against ground truth answers. Notably, the study finds that when relevant document chunks are provided to LLMs, their accuracy improves significantly (to 54.02%), indicating the necessity of direct knowledge access for effective generative performance. Conversely, without context, performance drops to 13.68%, underscoring the importance of well-tuned retrieval mechanisms. ### Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about enhancing LLMs with retrieval mechanisms, a relevant and timely topic given the rapid advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The integration of a RAG framework for a specific institutional context, such as the University of SÃ£o Paulo, adds a layer of applied research that is often underexplored. However, the concept of retrieval-augmented models is not entirely novel, as similar works exist in the literature, indicating that while the study is relevant, it may not significantly advance theoretical frameworks. **Significance:** The findings presented in this work indicate the crucial role that structured document access plays in the performance of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. The clear performance distinctions documented in terms of retrieval efficacy are commendable, providing valuable insights for future research. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of alternative retrieval techniques and broader applications beyond a singular institutional assistant. **Strengths:**  - The empirical evaluation presents a structured approach to assessing LLM performance in conjunction with retrieval mechanisms, providing tangible metrics that can guide further research. - The focus on a specific institutional application may aid in practical implementation and offer a foundation for other educational institutions to develop similar tools. **Weaknesses:**  - The paper's discussion on current semantic search limitations lacks depth, missing an opportunity to contextualize findings with existing literature, thus reducing potential implications for advancing semantic search methodologies. - Insights into how the retriever model could be improved or further optimized are sparse, which could enhance the utility of the research for practitioners and researchers alike. **Overall Assessment:** While the paper provides a focused exploration of an emerging area of research and presents compelling experimental results, its contributions to the broader field of LLMs and retrieval systems may not be groundbreaking enough to warrant high praise. The practical implications of the findings for education and institutional use are significant, but the novelty is somewhat diminished by the existing body of knowledge in RAG frameworks. Score: 6
- **Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.

### **[Utilizing Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13883v1)**
- **Authors**: MatyÃ¡Å¡ Lorenc
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the application of evolution strategies (ES) for training agents with decision-making policies based on transformer architectures in reinforcement learning (RL). Using OpenAI's evolution strategy, the authors conducted experiments in two environments: Humanoid locomotion and Atari games. They explored the viability of ES as a black-box optimization method for training complex models, including the Decision Transformer. A notable contribution is the introduction of a pretraining phase prior to the application of ES, which, although shown to be generally unnecessary for achieving strong performance, provided insights into the training process. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of ES in producing high-performing agents. **Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions, particularly in combining advanced ES techniques with transformers, which adds to the body of knowledge in both RL and evolutionary algorithms. However, several factors warrant a critical assessment: 1. **Novelty**: While the application of ES to transformer architectures is interesting, the approach itself is not entirely novel within the broader field of RL and optimization algorithms. Progress has been made in related domains exploring similar methodologies. The novelty primarily lies in demonstrating its effectiveness in more complex scenarios (like Transformers), yet this remains a relatively incremental step. 2. **Methodological Robustness**: The experiments conducted in well-defined environments (Humanoid locomotion and Atari) are a strength, indicating that the techniques may have practical applicability. However, the lack of a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art RL approaches or detail on hyperparameter optimization raises questions about the robustness of the findings. 3. **Insights and Practical Implications**: The observations regarding the pretraining phase, while highlighting potential insights gained, are somewhat diluted by the conclusion that pretraining was shown as unnecessary. This contradiction may detract from the practical implications of the findings, limiting their usefulness for practitioners in the field. 4. **Impact**: The contribution appears to extend existing knowledge on ES in RL but lacks significant disruptive potential or revolutionary insights that could reshape current methodologies in RL training. The paper could stimulate further research but does not fundamentally shift paradigms. In conclusion, while the paper has merits in its approach and execution, its contributions to the fields of RL and ES are more incremental rather than groundbreaking. Thus, the paper is evaluated with a score reflecting its moderate impact and significance. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: We explore a capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with its policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). We also proposed a method to aid the training by first pretraining the model before using the OpenAI-ES to train it further, and tested its effectiveness. The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to obtain high-performing agents. Therefore, the pretraining was shown to be unnecessary; yet still, it helped us observe and formulate several further insights.

### **[Exploring Finetuned Audio-LLM on Heart Murmur Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13884v1)**
- **Authors**: Adrian Florea, Xilin Jiang, Nima Mesgarani, Xiaofan Jiang
- **Classification**: eess.AS
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Exploring Finetuned Audio-LLM on Heart Murmur Features" investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for the analysis of heart sounds, specifically phonocardiograms (PCGs), in the context of diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Despite the success of LLMs in areas like speech and music recognition, their application in biomedical sound analysis remains significantly underexplored. The authors propose finetuning the Qwen2-Audio model on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope dataset to classify 11 heart murmur features, advancing beyond traditional deep neural networks which mainly differentiate between healthy and unhealthy murmurs. Furthermore, they introduce a preprocessing segmentation algorithm to enhance noise robustness and generalization. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based model surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for 8 of the 11 features, managing to classify long-tail features that previous techniques struggled with. This suggests a promising role for audio LLMs in assisting cardiologists with heart disease diagnosis. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper's novelty lies in its application of a fine-tuned audio LLM to classify detailed acoustic features of heart murmurs, extending beyond the basic healthy/unhealthy classification typical of existing approaches. By focusing on nuanced characteristics like timing and pitch, the authors address an important gap in biomedical sound analysis. The methodology also includes a novel preprocessing step that enhances the model's robustness against noise, which is a common challenge in real-world clinical settings.  **Strengths:** - The study employs state-of-the-art technology (LLMs) to tackle biomedical sound analysis, potentially revolutionizing the detection and diagnosis of heart conditions. - It demonstrates superior performance in classifying a range of murmur features, especially underrepresented ones, which highlights the model's broader applicability. - The combination of LLMs and innovative preprocessing techniques creates a comprehensive approach that is well-positioned to adapt to real-world clinical data, which is often noisy and incomplete. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a comparative analysis with more diverse datasets, as reliance on a single dataset may limit the generalizability of the modelâs findings. - While the performance metrics are promising, the study does not delve deeply into the implications of misclassifications, particularly in clinical practice, which is crucial for understanding potential risks. - The paper does not sufficiently discuss the need for validation in a clinical environment, which is essential before implementing such models in routine diagnostics. **Potential Influence:** This research exemplifies the intersection of machine learning and clinical practice and emphasizes the need for contemporary analytic approaches in healthcare. Should the findings hold in diverse clinical environments, the potential for LLMs to assist in diagnostic processes could be transformative, paving the way for more personalized medicine. The research also opens avenues for further studies on using LLMs in other areas of biomedical sound analysis. Based on the strengths and weaknesses evaluated, the paper shows significant contributions to the field with a robust application of AI in healthcare. However, more comprehensive validation and broader applications are needed for it to be fully impactful. ### Overall Score: 8 **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.

### **[Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13904v1)**
- **Authors**: Linh Tran, Wei Sun, Stacy Patterson, Ana Milanova
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach called Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL), designed to enhance the personalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) while ensuring privacy. This is particularly relevant in applications like customer support, where the integration of various modalities (text, image, audio) is crucial. The authors identify the challenge of maintaining a balance between personalization and generalization without compromising user privacy. To address this, they utilize a low-rank adaptation scheme that allows for effective generalization, while incorporating a residual term for personalization. They implement a method that applies local differential privacy to the low-rank components of local prompts and global differential privacy to the global prompts to enhance privacy while reducing the detrimental effects of privacy noise on model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DP-FPL method outperforms existing benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving the delicate balance of personalization, generalization, and privacy. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of federated learning with differencing approaches to privacy in the context of multimodal LLMs. While federated learning and differential privacy have both been previously explored in isolation, this paper successfully combines them to address the emerging challenge of personalization in AI systems. The application of a low-rank adaptation scheme is a clever way to maintain generalization, a significant contribution that could influence further research in this area. However, the paper does have some strengths and weaknesses. A notable strength is its thorough experimental validation, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach against established benchmarks, which adds rigor to its claims. Furthermore, the systematic treatment of privacy concerns is commendable, given the increasing importance of user privacy in AI. On the downside, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the proposed method, as federated learning can inherently be resource-intensive. Additionally, the scalability of the method to larger datasets and more complex tasks remains to be fully assessed, which is a crucial aspect when considering deployment in real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper provides a meaningful contribution to the field by addressing critical challenges in privacy, personalization, and generalization within multimodal LLMs.  **Score: 8.**   This score reflects the paper's solid contributions and its potential impact on future research in privacy-preserving AI systems, while noting that more detailed evaluations of computational aspects and scalability could further enhance its significance.
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.

- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Improving Video Generation with Human Feedback" addresses ongoing challenges in video generation, such as unsmooth motion and prompt misalignment, despite advancements using rectified flow techniques. The authors propose a comprehensive pipeline that integrates human feedback to enhance video generation models. Initially, they create a large-scale human preference dataset centered on modern video generation, which includes multi-dimensional pairwise annotations. The core innovation is the introduction of VideoReward, a reward model that incorporates these annotations. The paper explores the impact of different design choices on the effectiveness of rewards. It presents three novel alignment algorithms for flow-based models, derived from diffusion model strategies: Flow-DPO (direct preference optimization), Flow-RWR (reward weighted regression), and Flow-NRG (inference-time reward guidance). Experimental findings demonstrate that VideoReward surpasses existing models significantly, with Flow-DPO leading in performance. Flow-NRG facilitates user customization of objective weights during inference, enhancing personalization in video generation. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The work introduces several key innovations, including a large-scale human preference dataset specific to video generation and the VideoReward model. The adaptation of alignment algorithms from diffusion models to flow-based models is particularly noteworthy and reflects creative integration across methodologies. The authors also address a critical gap in the current video generation landscapeâperformance issues when aligning generated videos with promptsâby leveraging human feedback, which has not been extensively explored in prior works.  **Significance**: The significance of this research is substantial as it offers a meaningful contribution to the field of video generation, which faces ongoing challenges related to quality and alignment. By enhancing these areas through user feedback mechanisms, the study paves the way for more sophisticated and user-centered video generation systems, potentially influencing applications in entertainment, education, and personalized content creation. **Strengths**:  - The systematic approach to incorporating human feedback into video generation addresses real-world user needs, making the advancements potentially more applicable and beneficial. - The thorough experimental validation demonstrates clear superiority over existing models and methods, bolstering the claims of the paper. **Weaknesses**:  - While the focus on human feedback is a strong point, the reliance on a human preference dataset could raise questions about scalability and generalizability. The need for extensive human annotations may limit the applicability of the proposed methods in more resource-constrained settings. - The paper may not sufficiently address how different dimensions of user preference interact and how this can be effectively normalized or balanced in practice.  **Potential Impact**: Given the direction in which video generation is headed, this paper's methods and findings hold the potential to inform future developments, leading to enhanced usability and performance. However, the need for human feedback could be seen as a double-edged sword, requiring ongoing effort to curate datasets and manage the computational complexity involved. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a strong contribution to the field with several innovative elements and a systematic approach.

The paper is well-positioned to influence future research and application in video generation, making it a relevant and impactful addition to the literature.
- **Abstract**: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.

Nevertheless, it undoubtedly contributes valuable insights into the ongoing development and potential applications of T2I models. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models have made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt following and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI tools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future trajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.

- **Authors**: Guofeng Cui, Pichao Wang, Yang Liu, Zemian Ke, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CRPO (Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization), a novel approach designed to enhance machine translation by improving data selection through the integration of reward scores and model confidence. The authors argue that the current methods, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are limited due to their reliance on the quality of preference data. CRPO targets challenging sentence pairs, specifically those where the model shows uncertainty or poor performance, thereby fostering more effective learning. The method is primarily aimed at large language models (LLMs) but is also applicable to encoder-decoder frameworks like NLLB. Empirical results indicate that CRPO surpasses competing methods, such as RS-DPO, RSO, and MBR score, in terms of both translation accuracy and data efficiency. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of machine translation, particularly in the context of LLMs, by addressing a well-recognized limitationâthe effective utilization of preference data in DPO methods. The introduction of a strategy that leverages model uncertainty to prioritize data selection is both innovative and pragmatic, suggesting a clear pathway for enhancing machine translation performance. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The combination of confidence metrics and reward scoring to filter training data is a fresh approach. By focusing on uncertain model predictions, CRPO addresses the shortcomings of current preference optimization methods, which tend to rely on a more generic selection process. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide robust empirical results demonstrating the superiority of CRPO over established methods, lending credibility to their claims. 3. **Versatility**: The ability of CRPO to generalize beyond LLMs to systems like NLLB shows the method's broader applicability in the field of MT. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Underlying Models**: The effectiveness of CRPO still hinges on the quality and architecture of the underlying model. If the baseline model has substantial limitations, CRPO may not yield significant improvements. 2. **Preference Data Quality**: While CRPO addresses the selection of training scenarios, the dependence on initial human feedback quality for training could still pose challenges, especially in low-resource languages or dialects. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: Integrating CRPO into existing workflows may add complexity, which could deter researchers and practitioners who are seeking simpler adaptations. Overall, CRPO exhibits a meaningful contribution to the field of machine translation through its innovative methodology and achieved results. Its emphasis on effectively managing training data based on model confidence can inspire further research into adaptive learning methods. Considering the strengths, weaknesses, and the potential for CRPO to influence future research and practices in machine translation, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. This score reflects a solid contribution with pragmatic implications but acknowledges that the methodâs broader applicability may be constrained by underlying model architectures and data quality issues. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.
