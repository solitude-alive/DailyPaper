- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the increasing importance of organizing scholarly knowledge due to the rapid growth of published articles. It highlights traditional challenges in transforming unstructured knowledge from scholarly articles into structured, semantically rich formats, historically requiring considerable human intervention. The authors propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent user interfaces that assist in this transformation, enhancing existing scholarly knowledge infrastructures. They share insights from their integration of LLMs into these interfaces, including best practices and encountered obstacles, and conclude with a small-scale evaluation involving domain experts to assess the effectiveness of their approach. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its application of LLMs to enhance user interfaces for scholarly knowledge organization, which is a relatively innovative approach in the context of information retrieval and data curation. By addressing the gulf between unstructured text and structured knowledge representation, the paper presents a timely contribution to the fields of natural language processing and scholarly communication. However, the paper does have some limitations. While it proposes a practical integration strategy and reports on experiences, the details of these integrations and the evaluation methodologies lack depth. The user evaluation appears small-scale and may not be sufficient to substantiate broader claims about the effectiveness and generalizability of the LLM-supported components. Additionally, the obstacles encountered during LLM integration are minimally addressed, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the practical challenges. The significance of the research is notable as it connects advanced artificial intelligence techniques with tangible applications in scholarly communication, an area ripe for innovation. However, the abstract and results would benefit from clearer exposition on how their findings can influence future work in the field and whether such integrations could reshape scholarly practices on a larger scale. In summary, while the paper provides a fresh perspective on utilizing LLMs for creating intelligent user interfaces, it does not fully capitalize on its potential impact due to limitations in evaluation scope and depth. **Score: 6**
- **Abstract**: The number of published scholarly articles is growing at a significant rate, making scholarly knowledge organization increasingly important. Various approaches have been proposed to organize scholarly information, including describing scholarly knowledge semantically leveraging knowledge graphs. Transforming unstructured knowledge, presented within articles, to structured and semantically represented knowledge generally requires human intelligence and labor since natural language processing methods alone typically do not render sufficient precision and recall for many applications. With the recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly possible to provide truly intelligent user interfaces guiding humans in the transformation process. We present an approach to integrate non-intrusive LLMs guidance into existing user interfaces. More specifically, we integrate LLM-supported user interface components into an existing scholarly knowledge infrastructure. Additionally, we provide our experiences with LLM integration, detailing best practices and obstacles. Finally, we evaluate the approach using a small-scale user evaluation with domain experts.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces TokenVerse, a novel framework for multi-concept personalization using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. TokenVerse can successfully disentangle intricate visual elements from a single image, allowing users to generate new images that combine concepts derived from multiple images. The key innovation is the utilization of a DiT-based T2I model where text input influences the image generation process through attention and modulation techniques. The authors note that their modulation space is semantic, providing localized control over various complex concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, poses, and lighting. The framework functions by optimizing the relationship between image input and text descriptions to map specific words to distinct directions in this modulation space, effectively allowing for the generation of personalized images. The effectiveness of TokenVerse is demonstrated in challenging personalization scenarios, outperforming existing methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of TokenVerse lies in its approach to handling multiple images that can embody multiple concepts, which is a notable advancement over previous methods. This ability to combine and modulate concepts semantically and effectively through a pre-trained model suggests significant potential for fine-tuned personalization in image generation. Additionally, the identification of distinct directions for different concepts in the modulation space is a progressive step that may inspire future research in T2I tasks and personalized content creation. However, while the technical advances are impressive, the paper may not sufficiently explore the limitations of the method or its applicability in real-world scenarios. For example, while the framework claims to provide localized control, it remains to be seen how it performs in a broader range of contexts or with more complex scenes that may not fit neatly into the defined modulation categories. Furthermore, the practical usability of the method needs clarification, including the computational efficiency and the resources required for leveraging such a framework in everyday applications. In terms of impact, the paper seems to be positioned well within the evolving field of AI-driven image generation, particularly with increasing demand for personalized content across various platforms. However, it would benefit from a deeper discussion of future work or potential challenges that may arise in extending the framework. In summary, the strengths of TokenVerse include its innovative approach to multi-concept personalization and the practical utility demonstrated through its application. However, the paper somewhat under-reports the challenges and future directions necessary for broader implementation. Based on these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of 8. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: We present TokenVerse -- a method for multi-concept personalization, leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our framework can disentangle complex visual elements and attributes from as little as a single image, while enabling seamless plug-and-play generation of combinations of concepts extracted from multiple images. As opposed to existing works, TokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports a wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and lighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input text affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and scale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized control over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an optimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text description, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation space. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine the learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and showcase its advantages over existing methods. project's webpage in https://token-verse.github.io/

### **[CDW-CoT: Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12226v1)**
- **Authors**: Yuanheng Fang, Guoqing Chao, Wenqiang Lei, Shaobo Li, Dianhui Chu
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning (CDW-CoT), a novel method aimed at enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting methods tend to employ a uniform set of prompts for an entire dataset, which may not effectively address the diverse needs presented by different instances within the dataset. CDW-CoT overcomes this limitation by clustering the dataset to identify distinct groups and tailoring prompt construction to reflect characteristics specific to each group. The method trains a prompt probability distribution for each cluster and dynamically selects prompts for individual test instances based on their proximity to cluster centers. The evaluation shows that CDW-CoT significantly outperforms standard CoT techniques, with notable accuracy improvements on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**:  CDW-CoT introduces a new paradigm in approaching CoT prompting by integrating clustering and prompt optimization, which is a distinct advancement from traditional uniform prompt strategies. By recognizing the diversity within datasets and tailoring prompts accordingly, the authors exhibit a nuanced understanding that has the potential to drive improvements in the application of LLMs. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The combination of clustering and distance-weighted selection of prompts represents a creative solution to address the limitations of generic CoT methods. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The thorough experimentation across six diverse datasets bolsters the claims made, providing robust evidence of effectiveness. 3. **Significant Results**: The reported accuracy improvements over both standard CoT and manual prompting illustrate the potential for practical application and real-world relevance. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Clustering Limitations**: The effectiveness of clustering methods can vary significantly based on the underlying algorithm and parameters chosen, which may limit the approach if certain datasets are difficult to cluster effectively. 2. **Generalizability**: While promising results are shown, the paper does not discuss the applicability of CDW-CoT across different domains extensively, which raises questions about its generalizability. 3. **Complexity**: The added complexity of implementing clustering and customizing prompts may pose challenges in terms of scalability and ease of use, especially for practitioners without extensive ML backgrounds. **Impact**: The contribution of CDW-CoT is relevant and significant, as it could set a precedent for developing more context-sensitive reasoning frameworks in LLMs. This can lead to improved performance in applications requiring nuanced understanding, although its adaptation by the broader community will depend on overcoming the cited weaknesses. **Score**: 8 This score reflects the paper's considerable novelty and potential impact on the field of LLMs and reasoning tasks while acknowledging its limitations regarding clustering and generalizability, which leave room for further research and refinement.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in complex reasoning tasks through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. However, most existing CoT methods rely on using the same prompts, whether manually designed or automatically generated, to handle the entire dataset. This one-size-fits-all approach may fail to meet the specific needs arising from the diversities within a single dataset. To solve this problem, we propose the Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain of Thought (CDW-CoT) method, which dynamically constructs prompts tailored to the characteristics of each data instance by integrating clustering and prompt optimization techniques. Our method employs clustering algorithms to categorize the dataset into distinct groups, from which a candidate pool of prompts is selected to reflect the inherent diversity within the dataset. For each cluster, CDW-CoT trains the optimal prompt probability distribution tailored to their specific characteristics. Finally, it dynamically constructs a unique prompt probability distribution for each test instance, based on its proximity to cluster centers, from which prompts are selected for reasoning. CDW-CoT consistently outperforms traditional CoT methods across six datasets, including commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically, when compared to manual CoT, CDW-CoT achieves an average accuracy improvement of 25.34% on LLaMA2 (13B) and 15.72% on LLaMA3 (8B).

- **Abstract**: The improved competence of generative models can help building multi-modal virtual assistants that leverage modalities beyond language. By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.

### **[FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12243v1)**
- **Authors**: Yizhou Liu, Ziming Liu, Jeff Gore
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme" explores methods to enhance the pre-training of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations found in existing optimizers such as Adam when faced with gradient noise. The authors hypothesize that the loss landscape during pre-training behaves like a narrowing valley, where noise levels can significantly impact optimization performance. Experiments with synthetic loss functions reveal that under conditions of high gradient query noise, Adam's reduction of effective step size contributes to suboptimal performance compared to the Signum optimizer. To address this issue, the authors introduce FOCUS, an optimizer that combines features from Signum with an attraction mechanism towards moving average parameters, promoting larger step sizes while maintaining stability in the presence of noise. Their empirical results, particularly in training GPT-2, show that FOCUS outperforms Signum in stability and is faster than Adam. The findings encourage further investigation into the role of gradient noise in LLM training. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty:** 1. **Innovative Approach to Noise Handling:** The introduction of FOCUS represents a significant innovation by combining the strengths of existing optimization techniques (Signum and Adam) while also addressing a notable gap regarding gradient noise. 2. **Experimental Insights:** The use of synthetic loss functions to investigate optimizer performance under varying conditions of noise adds a unique dimension to the understanding of how different optimizers behave, which is not commonly addressed in the literature. **Significance:** 1. **Potential Impact on LLM Training:** By postulating that gradient noise is an underappreciated factor in the performance of optimizers, the paper opens avenues for future research that could lead to more efficient training approaches for LLMs. 2. **Practical Applications:** The demonstration of FOCUSâs effectiveness, particularly with a widely-used model like GPT-2, indicates practical implications for trainers and researchers in improving performance and stability in various machine learning applications. **Strengths:** - The alignment of theoretical insights with empirical results enhances the validity of the proposed method. - Clear motivation and justification for exploring new optimization strategies in LLM training, rooted in established concepts. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper discusses the implications of gradient noise, it could provide a more detailed analysis of varying noise levels in real-world scenarios, beyond the synthetic benchmarks. - Additional comparisons with other emerging optimizers and more extensive experiments on different models would strengthen the claims made about performance improvements. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field, particularly for those involved in the optimization challenges of LLMs. Its combination of theoretical exploration, empirical validation, and focus on a relevant problem makes it a meaningful addition to current research. **Score: 8**  ### Justification for the Score: The score of 8 reflects a robust contribution but acknowledges areas that could benefit from further elaboration and evidence. The novelty is significant in terms of exploring an often-overlooked aspect (gradient noise), and the results demonstrate clear performance benefits of the proposed optimizer, FOCUS. However, the paper could be strengthened by more comprehensive analysis and wider exploratory comparisons, which somewhat limit its overall impact. Therefore, while it provides a noteworthy step forward, there remains room for additional development and verification within the broader optimization landscape for LLMs.
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance, and improving their pre-training process appears to be key to enhancing their capabilities further. Based on the documented success of Adam, learning rate decay, and weight decay, we hypothesize that the pre-training loss landscape features a narrowing valley structure. Through experiments with synthetic loss functions, we discover that when gradient query noise is high relative to the valley's sharpness, Adam's performance falls behind that of Signum because Adam reduces the effective step size too drastically. This observation led us to develop FOCUS, an optimizer that enhances Signum by incorporating attraction toward moving averaged parameters, allowing it to handle noise better while maintaining larger step sizes. In training GPT-2, FOCUS proves to be more stable than Signum and faster than Adam. These results suggest that gradient noise may be an underappreciated limiting factor in LLM training, and FOCUS offers promising solutions.

### **[VipDiff: Towards Coherent and Diverse Video Inpainting via Training-free Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12267v1)**
- **Authors**: Chaohao Xie, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces VipDiff, a novel framework for video inpainting that employs training-free denoising diffusion models. Addressing the limitations of traditional video inpainting techniques that rely on optical flow for pixel propagation, VipDiff effectively handles large masked areas, which often suffer from artifacts due to the absence of pixel correspondences in their centers. This framework uniquely conditions diffusions on the reverse process, utilizing optical flow to extract valid pixels from reference frames. As a result, it optimizes randomly sampled Gaussian noise into temporally coherent inpainted outputs, allowing for diverse results by sampling different noise patterns. Experimental results indicate that VipDiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity in video inpainting. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  VipDiff presents an innovative approach by integrating diffusion models into video inpainting without requiring extensive training or fine-tuning, which is a notable departure from existing methods that necessitate predefined training data. The idea of conditioning the diffusion process utilizing optical flow for coherent results is also a fresh perspective, highlighting the interoperability of diffusion models with temporal constraints in video data. **Significance:**  The significance of VipDiff lies in its potential to alleviate common pitfalls in video inpaintingânamely, the generation of artifacts in regions where large areas need reconstruction. This addresses crucial practical challenges faced in video editing and restoration fields, potentially leading to applications in film post-production, archival video restoration, and real-time streaming enhancements. **Strengths:**  - The approach is innovative and leverages cutting-edge techniques in the realm of generative models without the burdensome requirements of training. - The focus on temporal coherence addresses a substantial gap in existing methods. - The experimental results provided are quantitative, showcasing significant improvements over current technologies. **Weaknesses:** - While the framework is compelling, the lack of a comprehensive training component may limit its application versatility compared to methods that can be fine-tuned for specific visual characteristics in different types of videos. - The paper could benefit from more qualitative assessments or comparisons, such as user studies, to confirm perceptions of fidelity beyond numerical results. - Depending on the experimental setup and random noise sampling, there may be limitations on the diversity of results, which warrants further exploration in various contexts. Based on these considerations, VipDiff is assessed as a notable contribution to the field of video inpainting, particularly in terms of addressing existing weaknesses in coherence and fidelity. However, the reliance on a purely training-free methodology may present long-term performance concerns in specialized applications. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent video inpainting methods have achieved encouraging improvements by leveraging optical flow to guide pixel propagation from reference frames either in the image space or feature space. However, they would produce severe artifacts in the mask center when the masked area is too large and no pixel correspondences can be found for the center. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating diverse and high-quality images, and have been exploited in a number of works for image inpainting. These methods, however, cannot be applied directly to videos to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, named VipDiff, for conditioning diffusion model on the reverse diffusion process to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models. VipDiff takes optical flow as guidance to extract valid pixels from reference frames to serve as constraints in optimizing the randomly sampled Gaussian noise, and uses the generated results for further pixel propagation and conditional generation. VipDiff also allows for generating diverse video inpainting results over different sampled noise. Experiments demonstrate that VipDiff can largely outperform state-of-the-art video inpainting methods in terms of both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity.

### **[Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12273v1)**
- **Authors**: Maosong Cao, Taolin Zhang, Mo Li, Chuyu Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Haodong Duan, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement" addresses the challenge of inadequately available high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for Large Language Models (LLMs) as they become increasingly sophisticated. The authors propose a two-stage synthetic data generation framework called Condor, which leverages a World Knowledge Tree and a Self-Reflection Refinement mechanism to create scalable, high-quality SFT data. Experimental results indicate that a base model fine-tuned on just 20,000 Condor-generated samples outperforms those trained on larger sets of traditional data. Furthermore, the paper highlights the iterative self-improvement potential of LLMs using the additional refinement stage, demonstrating effectiveness across different model sizesâup to 72 billion parameters. The authors also explore the significant but underutilized potential for performance enhancements through synthetic data post-training, suggesting interesting paths for future research. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its structured approach to synthetic data generation, specifically through its two intertwined componentsâWorld Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement. By explicitly addressing the current bottleneck of human-annotated data, the framework has the potential to significantly mitigate this issue in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs. The claim that models fine-tuned on Condor data can outperform those with traditional data configurations at small scales presents not only a practical advancement but also an intriguing method to maximize the use of synthetic data. However, while the methods proposed appear innovative, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous comparison with existing synthetic data generation techniques, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or traditional augmentation methods. Without sufficient benchmarks against these methods, it may be challenging to ascertain the absolute efficacy of Condor over prior approaches. Moreover, the scope of the experiments could be expanded to include a more varied set of tasks to fully validate the generalizability of their findings. Another point to consider is the potential risk of reliance on synthetic data, particularly regarding biases and misalignments that can arise from inadequate modeling of complex human language and knowledge structures. Such issues, while recognized in the paper, warrant a more detailed discussion on the implications of using synthetics extensively. In conclusion, Condor presents a significant contribution to the field by introducing a scalable method for generating high-quality synthetic data, with possibilities for iterative self-improvement in LLMs. Its promise is tempered, however, by the need for deeper analysis against existing frameworks and potential challenges in applicability. Given these strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of 7. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as LLMs become more advanced, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.

### **[MoGERNN: An Inductive Traffic Predictor for Unobserved Locations in Dynamic Sensing Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12281v1)**
- **Authors**: Qishen Zhou, Yifan Zhang, Michail A. Makridis, Anastasios Kouvelas, Yibing Wang, Simon Hu
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MoGERNN, a novel inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model designed for predicting traffic states in partially observed road networksâa scenario where sensor coverage is limited due to financial constraints. Traditional traffic prediction models often require extensive retraining when sensor setups change and typically assume complete sensor data, which is unrealistic in practice. MoGERNN tackles these challenges by incorporating the Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block, which uses multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network to effectively model complex spatial relationships. This approach estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are further refined through a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates spatial and temporal dependencies for predicting future traffic states. The effectiveness of MoGERNN was validated through experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms baseline methods in traffic prediction, including in areas without sensors, thereby enhancing its utility for traffic management. The model also adapts well to changing sensor networks, maintaining performance comparable to retrained alternatives. Ablation studies affirm the contributions of its critical components to overall predictive performance. **Critical Evaluation and Score:** **Novelty and Contribution:** MoGERNN presents a meaningful advancement in the field of traffic prediction, particularly for scenarios involving limited sensor availability. By integrating principles from Large Language Models through the Mixture of Experts paradigm into traffic modeling, it establishes a new approach that tackles the inherent challenges of sparsity in sensor data. This innovation potentially shifts the way researchers and practitioners approach traffic state predictions, emphasizing adaptability and efficiency. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Architecture:** The introduction of the MoGE block offers a fresh perspective on incorporating multiple data aggregators, which may significantly enhance predictive accuracy across diverse scenarios. 2. **Real-World Relevancy:** The focus on unobserved locations reflects a real-world challenge, making the model applicable and valuable for urban traffic management. 3. **Robust Testing:** The use of real-world datasets and comprehensive testing (including ablation studies) provides confidence in the model's performance and reliability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization Limitations:** While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on two datasets, it remains uncertain how well the model generalizes across various urban environments and sensor configurations that were not explored. 2. **Model Complexity:** The incorporation of multiple components increases the modelâs complexity, which may lead to challenges in deployment and real-time application. 3. **Assessment of Scalability:** The paper does not extensively address how the model scales with significantly larger networks or with more dynamic changes in sensor setups. **Overall Assessment:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of traffic prediction by addressing practical limitations associated with sensor availability and model retraining. However, the model's generalizability and complexity could be further explored in future work. Nonetheless, the advancements made by MoGERNN represent a noteworthy step in improving traffic management systems through innovative modeling techniques. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Given a partially observed road network, how can we predict the traffic state of unobserved locations? While deep learning approaches show exceptional performance in traffic prediction, most assume sensors at all locations of interest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, these methods typically require costly retraining when sensor configurations change. We propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model, to address these challenges. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts approach in Large Language Models, we introduce a Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block to model complex spatial dependencies through multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network. This block estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are then processed by a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates a graph message aggregator to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict future states. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNN consistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobserved locations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areas without sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management. Moreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintaining competitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart. Tests with different numbers of available sensors confirm its consistent superiority, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of its key modules.

- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to curriculum modeling in personalized higher education by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion. The authors argue that effective learning personalization requires a thorough understanding of domain models and learning contexts. By linking university subjects and their topics to domain models, they aim to create a cohesive learning path that integrates modules across different faculties. The methodology involves a collaborative process where LLMs aid experts in extracting detailed educational content from lecture materials. The authors develop comprehensive models that encompass domain, curriculum, and user aspects, specifically implementing their approach in two modules related to Embedded Systems. The study evaluates the constructed KG through expert validation and graph quality metrics, demonstrating that their method significantly enhances interdisciplinary course connections for personalized learning experiences. Feedback from domain experts indicates a strong acceptance of the proposed approach for concept extraction and classification. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper asserts a unique application of LLMs in enhancing knowledge graph completion for higher education curriculum modeling, which is a relatively underexplored area. Traditionally, curriculum design has relied heavily on expert knowledge without leveraging computational methods to connect disparate topics across domains. By integrating LLMs in this process, the approach demonstrates an innovative blend of technology and pedagogy that is timely and relevant in today's educational landscape. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to reshape the personalization of learning paths in higher education. The creation of a comprehensive KG linking various disciplines can facilitate tailored educational experiences, possibly improving student engagement and retention. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the model development highlights the potential for stakeholder involvement, which is critical for the acceptance and effectiveness of educational technologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of LLMs with expert human curation presents a fresh perspective on curriculum design. 2. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: The ability to connect courses across faculties promotes an integrated educational approach, which is increasingly relevant. 3. **Validation Framework**: The dual evaluation method (qualitative expert feedback and quantitative metrics) adds robustness to the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns**: While the model was developed for two specific modules, the scalability of this approach to larger academic programs or institutions is not discussed thoroughly. 2. **Dependence on Expert Input**: The reliance on human experts for concept extraction may introduce bias or limit the model's efficacy if expert perspectives are narrow or inconsistent. 3. **Limited Generalizability**: The findings, if only applied within the contexts of the two chosen modules, may not necessarily be applicable across all fields of higher education. In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the intersection of technology and education, with a focus on enhancing learning personalization. However, there are aspects related to scalability and generalizability that require further exploration. Overall, its forward-thinking integration of LLMs in education holds promise, yet demands more empirical validation across diverse contexts. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics.

- **Authors**: Thomas Walshe, Sae Young Moon, Chunyang Xiao, Yawwani Gunawardana, Fran Silavong
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration" addresses the challenge of acquiring high-quality labeled training data in machine learning, which is often expensive and time-consuming. The authors investigate the potential of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic data labeling, given the limitations and concerns associated with proprietary models like GPT-4. They introduce a novel approach called Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC), which focuses on using label schema dynamically during the labeling process. This technique allows the LLM to consider one label at a time, starting from the most relevant, thus improving performance in high-cardinality labeling tasks. The results indicate that RAC enhances labeling accuracy while balancing label quality and coverage, providing a viable solution for automating the labeling of internal datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several significant strengths. Firstly, the choice to explore open-source LLMs addresses crucial concerns regarding privacy and cost, which are barriers to the widespread application of advanced machine learning techniques in industry. The introduction of the RAC method represents a thoughtful innovation; by dynamically integrating label descriptions, the paper shifts away from traditional, less efficient methods of label classification that can struggle with high cardinality. However, the paper has some limitations. While the approach demonstrates improvements, the experimental details, such as the datasets used and metrics for evaluation, are not discussed in depth, which may impede reproducibility and limit the understanding of the method's applicability across different scenarios. Additionally, although the paper claims performance improvements, it would benefit from a stronger comparative analysis with existing methods to quantify the advantages more convincingly. The novelty of the study lies not only in the application of RAC but also in its broader implications for how LLMs can manage label integration in machine learning tasks. The concept of dynamically iterating through labels to enhance classification mirrors emerging trends towards more interactive and user-influenced AI systems. Overall, the paper has a meaningful impact on the field of automated machine learning and the use of LLMs for data labeling. Given the significant concerns it addresses, alongside its innovative approach, I would rate the paper as follows: **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to open-source LLM application and labeling methodologies while noting certain areas for improvement in clarity and comparative analysis. The work provides valuable insights and lays a foundation for further exploration in enhancing the efficacy of label integration in machine learning.
- **Abstract**: Acquiring labelled training data remains a costly task in real world machine learning projects to meet quantity and quality requirements. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.

### **[Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352v1)**
- **Authors**: Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Emily B. Fox
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a unifying framework for understanding various architectures used in sequence modeling through the lens of associative memory and regression at test-time. The authors argue that effective sequence models must have the capability for associative recall, which they show is linked to the ability to memorize input tokens. They analyze numerous contemporary architectures, such as linear attention models and state-space models, framing them as different strategies for performing test-time regression. The paper outlines three design choices that dictate an architecture's performance: the weight of associations, the nature of the regressor function, and the optimization method used. This approach not only provides insights into model design but also offers theoretical validation for existing methods, paving the way for advanced developments in sequence modeling. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's central thesis provides a significant contribution to the field by proposing a coherent framework that connects a variety of seemingly disparate sequence modeling techniques. The emphasis on associative memory as a key component in sequence modeling is innovative and highlights an often-overlooked aspect of model performanceârecall of learned inputs. One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to derive insights from existing models and establish connections that may inspire further research. The treatment of models like linear attention and softmax attention is particularly notable, as it contextualizes these methods within a broader theoretical framework. Additionally, the authors' introduction of regression as a critical function at test-time could stimulate new research directions aimed at more effective design principles. However, while the framework is unifying, it risks oversimplifying the complexities inherent in the design and behavior of advanced sequence models. Moreover, the empirical validation of the framework and its propositions could be stronger; the paper largely relies on theoretical underpinnings without detailed experiments to substantiate the claims regarding model performance or efficiency. The theoretical connections drawn in the paper, such as the justification for QKNorm, are valuable but could be built upon with more rigorous analytical or empirical studies. As a result, while the framework is promising, the actual application of it in new model development and real-world scenarios remains to be fully tested. In summary, while the paper articulates a compelling vision for understanding and integrating sequence models, the potential impact may be somewhat tempered by the need for more empirical grounding.  **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.

### **[Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1)**
- **Authors**: Yeounoh Chung, Gaurav T. Kakkar, Yu Gan, Brenton Milne, Fatma Ozcan
- **Classification**: cs.DB
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL" investigates how the extended context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically Google's gemini-1.5-pro, can enhance the natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) transformation task. NL2SQL is inherently complex due to the ambiguity of natural language questions and the precise requirements for SQL syntax in relation to complex data schemas. The authors explore various forms of contextual informationâincluding column example values, question and SQL pairs, user hints, and SQL documentationâto assess their impact on the model's performance and latency. This research is unique in its comprehensive analysis of how extended context and additional contextual elements contribute to accuracy and efficiency in NL2SQL tasks. The results indicate that the long-context capabilities of LLMs are effective, as demonstrated by a benchmark score of 67.41% on the BIRD dataset without needing finetuning or complex techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel exploration of the relationship between extended context usage in LLMs and the efficiency of NL2SQL generation. This is highly relevant due to the increasing importance of automated querying systems, especially with the growth of data-centric applications.  Strengths: 1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The exploration of long context in LLMs aligns with current trends in NLP and data querying, offering insights that reflect the advancements in model architecture and capabilities. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides a thorough examination of various types of contextual prompts, which could benefit further research and practical implementations in NL2SQL tasks. 3. **Strong Performance Results**: Achieving a 67.41% accuracy on the BIRD benchmark with minimal additional techniques is impressive and suggests significant potential for real-world applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Benchmark Comparisons**: While the BIRD benchmark is relevant, further comparisons with other NL2SQL benchmarks or datasets could strengthen the validity of the results and generalizability to different contexts. 2. **Lack of Finetuning Analysis**: The paper mentions the lack of finetuning and more sophisticated methods, which raises questions about the model's scalability and adaptability in different scenarios with more complex datasets. 3. **Potential Overlook of Complexity**: The simplifying assumption that longer context alone yields better results may overlook other crucial factors impacting model performance, such as the nature of the queries or inherent biases in data schema representations. Overall, while the paper provides valuable insights and has potential implications for the field, its empirical analysis feels somewhat limited in scope when considering the diverse nature of real-world NL2SQL applications. Given these points, I would rate the paper as a **7** out of 10.  **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.

### **[Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongjun Wang, Wonmin Byeon, Jiarui Xu, Jinwei Gu, Ka Chun Cheung, Xiaolong Wang, Kai Han, Jan Kautz, Sifei Liu
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), an innovative attention mechanism designed to address limitations faced by existing models in efficiently processing multi-dimensional, spatially coherent image data. Unlike conventional methods that transform multi-dimensional data into 1D sequences, GSPN retains 2D spatial structures and deploys a line-scan approach to establish dense pairwise connections. This mechanism implements the Stability-Context Condition to maintain stable, context-aware data propagation, effectively reducing the sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for square maps, thereby improving computational efficiency. The GSPN operates with learnable, input-dependent weights and eliminates the need for positional embeddings, resulting in enhanced spatial fidelity. Its performance outstrips current standards in several vision tasks, exemplified by accelerated generation in SD-XL models by more than 84 times for 16K image outputs. **Critical Evaluation:** The introduction of GSPN marks a notable advancement in the field of attention mechanisms, particularly for vision tasks where spatial coherence is crucial. The emphasis on maintaining 2D spatial structures while reducing computational demands presents a compelling challenge to traditional transformer models that typically flatten data for processing. The Stability-Context Condition represents a novel conceptual framework that aims to optimize propagation across 2D sequences, which could inspire further research into context-aware models for various applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** GSPN introduces a fundamentally new way to approach attention mechanisms that can directly benefit tasks uniquely tied to spatial representational fidelity. 2. **Computational Efficiency:** The significant reduction in effective sequence length and improved speed for high-resolution image generation highlights GSPN's practical advantages, potentially enabling faster workflows in real-world applications. 3. **Performance Metrics:** Achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse vision tasks lends credibility to the methodologies adopted and underscores the competitive edge of GSPN over prior models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While GSPN shows promise, how it scales with even larger datasets or more intricate tasks remains an open question. The multi-fold increase in computational performance should be weighed against potential complexities arising from its dense connection strategy. 2. **Dependence on Specific Context:** The reliance on the Stability-Context Condition may pose challenges in varied applications with highly dynamic spatial relationships; additional empirical evidence across a broader spectrum of tasks would strengthen its validity. 3. **Comparison with Existing Models:** While claimed improvements in specific tasks are impressive, a more exhaustive comparison against contemporary models in diverse settings and datasets would provide a better insight into its overall effectiveness. This paper represents a substantial contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision. Its novel approach could inspire future research, although the practical implications of broader applications still need to be evaluated. Given the strengths and room for further validation, I assign a score of 8. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a new attention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2D spatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linear attention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as 1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomes these limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data and forming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central to GSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-aware propagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and no reliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity and state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNet classification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation. Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ when generating 16K images.

- **Authors**: Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Sihui Ji, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces **DiffDoctor**, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to enhance image diffusion models by reducing the production of artifacts. The first stage involves creating a robust artifact detection system, supported by a dataset of over 1 million flawed synthesized images and an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation strategy that ensures a balanced representation of defects. The second stage integrates the developed artifact detector to generate per-pixel confidence maps for the image generation process, allowing for more focused refinement of the diffusion model. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments that their approach effectively reduces artifacts in text-to-image diffusion models, supporting the proposed diagnose-then-treat paradigm. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The novelty of DiffDoctor lies in its dual approachâfirst diagnosing the specific locations of artifacts and then treating them rather than relying solely on holistic quality assessments. This targeted methodology is a marked advancement over existing strategies that do not account for spatial variations in defects. Additionally, the creation of a large dataset specifically for artifact detection contributes to the field by providing necessary resources for development and evaluation. **Significance:** In the context of the rapidly evolving field of image synthesis, as seen with the growing interest in diffusion models, producing cleaner images is paramount. The proposed methodology addresses a significant issueâartifactsâthat hinder the full potential of these technologies in practical applications. By introducing a systematic process for detecting and correcting defects, DiffDoctor could enhance the reliability of image generation tools, which may lead to wider adoption in various fields such as gaming, film, and virtual reality. **Strengths:** - The large-scale dataset and human-in-the-loop annotation process are well-conceived and likely to yield high-quality training for the artifact detection model. - The rigorous experimental setup provides compelling evidence for the proposed method's effectiveness, enhancing confidence in the results. **Weaknesses:** - The study focuses exclusively on text-to-image diffusion models, which may limit the general applicability of the findings to other diffusion tasks or models. - The potential computational overhead introduced by the two-stage process may raise concerns about efficiency and feasibility in real-time applications. **Potential Influence:** Given the growing importance of mitigating artifacts in image synthesis, DiffDoctor could set a precedent for future research focused on defect identification and correction in generative models. It highlights the importance of not only generating high-quality images but also understanding and managing the failures of these models. **Score: 8** This score reflects a balanced view of the paper's contributions and limitations. While indeed innovative and addressing a relevant problem within the field of image diffusion models, there remains a gap in applicability across various contexts and model types that future research will need to address. The strong methodological approach and the potential impact on the domain bolster its overall significance, yet further generalization and efficiency improvements would enhance its utility.
- **Abstract**: In spite of the recent progress, image diffusion models still produce artifacts. A common solution is to refine an established model with a quality assessment system, which generally rates an image in its entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to tune the diffusion model through assigning a per-pixel confidence map for each synthesis. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.

### **[Audio Texture Manipulation by Exemplar-Based Analogy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12385v1)**
- **Authors**: Kan Jen Cheng, Tingle Li, Gopala Anumanchipalli
- **Classification**: cs.SD
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel method for audio texture manipulation using an exemplar-based analogy model. Rather than relying on text-based commands, the technique utilizes pairs of audio clips: one representing the original sound and another exemplifying the desired transformation. The model is designed to learn this transformation and apply it to new inputs, successfully enabling various modifications to audio textures. A curated quadruplet dataset was created for different editing tasks, and the authors trained a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised way. Evaluation results, both quantitative and perceptual, demonstrate that this approach exceeds the performance of traditional text-conditioned models and can adapt to real-world and non-speech scenarios. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its shift from conventional text-based audio manipulation to a more intuitive and example-driven approach. This is significant because audio manipulation often struggles with subjective interpretations of text-based instructions, leading to less effective or less controllable outputs. By using audio pairs, the model allows for clearer transformation guidance, potentially making it more user-friendly and applicable in practical scenarios, such as sound design and music production. One strength of the paper is its emphasis on a self-supervised learning paradigm, which enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse audio domains. This is particularly relevant given the abundance of unlabeled audio data available. Additionally, the construction of a quadruplet dataset for training highlights the authors' approach to addressing the complexity of audio transformations, which may not map neatly to textual representations. However, there are also several weaknesses and areas for improvement. The scope of the evaluation could benefit from a larger variety of conditions and scenarios beyond speech, particularly concerning different genres of music or environmental sounds. Moreover, while the paper claims to outperform existing models, the specific metrics used for comparison and the extent of this performance gap should be detailed with clearer visualizations to substantiate the claims made, thus reinforcing the arguments presented. Furthermore, the direct applicability and computational efficiency of the model in real-time scenarios remain to be assessed, an essential factor for broader adoption in production environments. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insight into a potentially transformative method for audio manipulation, balancing novelty with practical applications. However, due to the current limitations in evaluation scope and depth, as well as a lack of extensive comparative analysis, I assign the following score: Score: 7
- **Abstract**: Audio texture manipulation involves modifying the perceptual characteristics of a sound to achieve specific transformations, such as adding, removing, or replacing auditory elements. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based analogy model for audio texture manipulation. Instead of conditioning on text-based instructions, our method uses paired speech examples, where one clip represents the original sound and another illustrates the desired transformation. The model learns to apply the same transformation to new input, allowing for the manipulation of sound textures. We construct a quadruplet dataset representing various editing tasks, and train a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised manner. We show through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies that our model outperforms text-conditioned baselines and generalizes to real-world, out-of-distribution, and non-speech scenarios.

The novel use of dense annotations and adaptive token compression represents a useful contribution to the field. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The demonstration of improved performance benchmarks lends credibility to the proposed methods. The results showing a sixfold increase in input memory are particularly significant, indicating a substantial advancement in the modelâs capabilities. 3. **Potential for Further Research**: By emphasizing multimodal context richness, the paper opens pathways for future explorations in video understanding and MLLM architectures. However, there are some weaknesses to consider: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results are compelling, a more rigorous comparative analysis with other leading MLLM frameworks could strengthen the paper by positioning the contributions more clearly against existing state-of-the-art models. 2. **Generalizability**: The focus on specific benchmarks may limit the perceived robustness of the findings. It would benefit the authors to validate their model across a broader set of datasets and tasks to ensure versatility in diverse real-world applications. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The methods proposed, given their innovative nature, may introduce computational complexity that could hinder practical application. A discussion on computational trade-offs and efficiency could further substantiate the impact of their work.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation" explores the utility of GPS data embedded in photo metadata as a control signal for generating images. The authors train models that convert GPS coordinates into images, particularly focusing on a diffusion model that generates images conditioned on both GPS locations and text. This allows for the generation of images that authentically reflect the unique characteristics of different city neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. Furthermore, the study details a method for extracting three-dimensional models from the two-dimensional GPS-to-image outputs by employing score distillation sampling, accentuating how GPS conditioning facilitates the quality of reconstructed images from various viewpoints. Evaluations demonstrate that the models infused with GPS data are adept at producing location-specific images and enhancing the accuracy of estimated 3D structures. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper presents a compelling novel approach by integrating GPS data with image generation processes through a diffusion model. While the application of GPS in image modeling has been touched upon in previous studies, the authors add value by demonstrating how GPS can serve as a control signal for generating highly localized images and reconstructing 3D structures. The combination of text and GPS data to condition image generation creates a new avenue for high-fidelity synthetic media that reflects real-world variations, which is a significant contribution. **Significance:** The significance lies in the practical implications of the research, especially in fields such as urban planning, tourism, and virtual simulations, where realistic representations of varying locales are essential. The ability to generate images that accurately convey the essence of different geographic areas opens new possibilities for user-guided imagery and interactive applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of diffusion models for conditioning on GPS and text is an innovative approach that can inspire future research. 2. **Multidimensional Output:** The ability to extract 3D models from the generated images is a noteworthy advancement that goes beyond image generation to spatial representation. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The evaluation results suggest that the models effectively learn location-based characteristics, providing solid empirical support for the claims made. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Contextual Application:** While the results are promising, the application seems primarily urban-centric, which could limit broader generalizability to diverse environments (e.g., rural areas) where GPS data may not carry the same significance. 2. **Complexity of Model Training:** The addition of GPS and text as conditioning elements may complicate the model training process, requiring substantial computational resources and potentially influencing accessibility for broader research engagement. 3. **Lack of Wider Comparisons:** The paper could improve its impact by comparing its outcomes directly to other state-of-the-art techniques in the image generation field, thereby contextualizing its contributions more sharply. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution by addressing an innovative intersection of geographical information systems and image generation technologies. It enhances depth in understanding spatial variations through data-driven methodologies, suggesting potential future avenues for applied research. However, the limitations in broader applicability and direct comparative evaluations weaken the impact somewhat. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovative aspect and practical significance, while also acknowledging the limitations in scope and comparative analysis, which are essential for positioning advancements within an evolving research landscape.
- **Abstract**: We show that the GPS tags contained in photo metadata provide a useful control signal for image generation. We train GPS-to-image models and use them for tasks that require a fine-grained understanding of how images vary within a city. In particular, we train a diffusion model to generate images conditioned on both GPS and text. The learned model generates images that capture the distinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. We also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillation sampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of the reconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that our GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure.

- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Towards Affordance-Aware Articulation Synthesis for Rigged Objects" addresses the challenge of articulating rigged objects in a way that is both realistic and context-sensitive. These objects, prevalent in the artistic and animation pipelines, can be difficult to pose naturally without extensive input from skilled artists. The authors introduce a novel system called A3Syn, which automates the synthesis of articulation parameters for various rigged objects based on specific contexts defined by environment meshes and text prompts. A3Syn employs a 2D inpainting diffusion model and advanced control techniques to generate affordance-aware postures. It also innovates a robust bone correspondence alignment approach using differentiable rendering and semantic matching. The process is designed to operate efficiently, delivering results in minutes without the need for extensive training data or rigid topological constraints on the rigs used. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The paper makes several notable contributions to the field of computer graphics and animation. The approach of synthesizing articulation based on environmental context and affordance awareness is quite innovative, addressing a significant limitation in current rigged object manipulation systems. The use of a 2D inpainting diffusion model for generating complex poses is a fresh perspective that suggests potential for broader applications beyond the specific case of rigged objects. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach**: The integration of inpainting diffusion models and the lack of strict topological assumptions represent a significant advancement. This opens doors for more flexible and varied applications in animations and simulations. 2. **Efficiency**: The ability of A3Syn to produce results within minutes while maintaining stability and plausibility in output is a strong advantage, particularly in high-demand creative environments. 3. **Broad Applicability**: The systemâs compatibility with a wide range of rigged objects found online enhances its practical relevance and usability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Training Data Limitations**: The claim of operating with limited training data, while ambitious and beneficial, may lead to challenges in the robustness of the models, especially in edge cases where unique rig variations are presented. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could fall short regarding the quantitative evaluation of the synthesized articulations; stronger metrics could reinforce claims about convergence and plausibility. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: There is minimal discussion on how A3Syn compares to existing methods in terms of both qualitative output and computational efficiency, which could leave some questions around its relative performance. **Potential Influence**: This work has the potential to significantly impact fields such as game design, animation, and virtual reality, where the need for dynamic and realistic representations of objects is increasing. If the methodologies presented in A3Syn are adopted and further developed, they could change the landscape of rigged object utilization in these areas. ### Conclusion Overall, while the paper presents a compelling foundation and a clear advancement in affordance-aware articulation for rigged objects, it has room for improvement in terms of validation and comparative analysis. Its innovative aspect, particularly with the synthesis methods and operational efficiency, however, positions it as a noteworthy contribution to the field of computer graphics. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Rigged objects are commonly used in artist pipelines, as they can flexibly adapt to different scenes and postures. However, articulating the rigs into realistic affordance-aware postures (e.g., following the context, respecting the physics and the personalities of the object) remains time-consuming and heavily relies on human labor from experienced artists. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem and design A3Syn. With a given context, such as the environment mesh and a text prompt of the desired posture, A3Syn synthesizes articulation parameters for arbitrary and open-domain rigged objects obtained from the Internet. The task is incredibly challenging due to the lack of training data, and we do not make any topological assumptions about the open-domain rigs. We propose using 2D inpainting diffusion model and several control techniques to synthesize in-context affordance information. Then, we develop an efficient bone correspondence alignment using a combination of differentiable rendering and semantic correspondence. A3Syn has stable convergence, completes in minutes, and synthesizes plausible affordance on different combinations of in-the-wild object rigs and scenes.

### **[Accelerate High-Quality Diffusion Models with Inner Loop Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13107v1)**
- **Authors**: Matthew Gwilliam, Han Cai, Di Wu, Abhinav Shrivastava, Zhiyu Cheng
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), an innovative method aimed at enhancing the inference speed of diffusion models. ILF introduces a lightweight module that predicts future features during the denoising process by using outputs from a specific block in the diffusion backbone at a particular time step. The method relies on two primary insights: that outputs from adjacent time steps are typically similar and that performing partial computations on a step is more efficient than completely skipping it. The feedback module can be based on any block from the diffusion backbone, with its effect modulated by a learnable scaling factor initialized to zero. ILF is trained using distillation losses, but unlike previous approaches, the backbone is kept frozen, focusing the training on the feedback module. The goal is to achieve high image quality in fewer steps while reducing runtime effectively. Empirical results demonstrate that ILF can significantly match the performance of diffusion models that require more steps while achieving 1.7x to 1.8x speedups based on metrics like FID, CLIP score, and qualitative assessments. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The Inner Loop Feedback methodology introduces an efficient mechanism to predict future features during the denoising process, which can be seen as a novel contribution in the realm of diffusion models. 2. **Practical Implications:** Reducing inference time while maintaining image quality is a significant challenge in the field. ILF demonstrates that this can be achieved by leveraging existing network structures creatively. 3. **Robust Testing:** The paper supports its claims with various quantitative metrics, such as FID and CLIP scores, providing a well-rounded validation of the proposed method's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Improvement:** While ILF does provide speed improvements, the extent to which it impacts broader applications or more complex diffusion models remains unclear. The paper does not sufficiently explore all potential environments where this technique may or may not apply. 2. **Assumption on Similarity:** The approach relies heavily on the assumption that outputs from adjacent steps are similar. While this may hold for many cases, exceptions could limit the approach's robustness. 3. **Interaction with Other Techniques:** The paper does not extensively discuss how ILF can be integrated with or benefit from existing acceleration techniques in diffusion models, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability. **Impact on the Field:** ILF's approach to deepening the understanding of the efficient use of feedback mechanisms in diffusion models may spur further research into optimizing inference speeds in other types of generative models. However, its adoption and relevance will highly depend on the community's reception and further corroboration through empirical testing in diverse scenarios. **Score Justification:** Assigning a score of 7 reflects the paper's notable innovation and practical contributions to the field, balanced with concerns regarding the limits of its assumptions and the potential for broader integration. It stands out for clarity and rigorous empirical evaluation, yet the need for wider applicability and consideration of the competitive landscape reduces the maximum impact score. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

- **Abstract**: Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.

- **Authors**: Xin Xu, Jiaxin Zhang, Tianhao Chen, Zitong Chao, Jishan Hu, Can Yang
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces UGMathBench, a new benchmark for assessing undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The benchmark consists of 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring varied answer types and multiple randomized versions of each problem. Two innovative metrics are proposed: effective accuracy (EAcc), which gauges the correctness of solved problems across all versions, and the reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which indicates the robustness of reasoning by representing the difference between average accuracy and EAcc. An evaluation of 23 prominent LLMs found that the highest EAcc was 56.3% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with notable $\Delta$ values signaling room for improvement. The authors aim for UGMathBench to facilitate future advancements in LLMs' mathematical problem-solving capabilities by providing a comprehensive testing framework. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution by identifying gaps in existing benchmarks for mathematical reasoning with LLMs and proposing UGMathBench as a solution. The scale and diversity of UGMathBench (covering 5,062 problems and multiple subjects) represent significant progress over previous benchmarks, which often lack comprehensive coverage or exhibit test-set contamination. The introduction of both EAcc and $\Delta$ metrics is particularly innovative as they provide nuanced insights into model performance beyond mere accuracy. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensiveness**: The large number of problems and subjects covered enhances the benchmark's applicability and relevance to undergraduate mathematical reasoning. 2. **Dynamic Nature**: The provision for multiple randomized problem versions and future expansion is a forward-thinking approach, addressing potential overfitting to a static dataset. 3. **Insightful Metrics**: EAcc and reasoning gap ($\Delta$) offer deeper evaluation criteria that prompt further understanding and research into LLM performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Baseline Performance**: While the paper reports the highest EAcc at 56.3%, this statistic alone may obscure broader performance trends or the challenge of achieving effective reasoning. The reasons for the varying performance across LLMs need closer examination. 2. **Generalizability**: Although UGMathBench focuses on undergraduate-level problems, its effectiveness in evaluating mathematical reasoning in other educational contexts or for different complexity levels remains untested. 3. **Future Work**: The paperâs call for "large reasoning models" implies a need for further development and exploration, but it lacks a clear roadmap or specific methodologies for achieving this within the context of the current limitations identified. **Overall Evaluation:** Despite its strengths, such as innovation in benchmarking and insightful metrics, the paper's complexity and implications may not be fully realizable until the dynamic nature of UGMathBench is put to the test against a broader spectrum of LLMs and educational settings. The novelty of using comprehensive sets of problems with dynamic versions is promising, and the preliminary results suggest ample room for improvement in LLMs' mathematical reasoning.  Considering these points, I would assign the paper a score of **8**, indicating a strong and significant contribution to the field with a well-defined methodology that challenges existing benchmarks and encourages innovative thinking for future LLM developments. Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.

### **[An Efficient Diffusion-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13767v1)**
- **Authors**: Mingzhao Wang, You Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yubin Xiao, Xuan Wu, Wei Pang, Yuan Jiang, Hui Yang, Peng Zhao, Yuanshu Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents DEITSP, an innovative diffusion-based model designed to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in a non-autoregressive (NAR) fashion. It addresses the common trade-off where NAR methods often lag in solution quality compared to autoregressive approaches while benefitting from faster inference times. DEITSP introduces a one-step diffusion model that enhances solution prediction through a process of controlled noise addition and self-consistency, allowing simultaneous denoising of multiple potential solutions. The model employs a dual-modality graph transformer for improved feature extraction and fusion, enhancing the inference efficiency with a leaner architecture. An iterative strategy is developed to optimize exploration by alternating noise addition and removal, complemented by a scheduling framework that progressively refines the solution space. Empirical results indicate that DEITSP outperforms other neural models on various TSP instances in terms of solution quality, speed, and generalization capabilities. **Evaluation**: The paper exhibits significant novelty due to its approach to integrating diffusion models in the context of TSP, particularly with an emphasis on NAR methodologies. The combination of a one-step diffusion process, dual-modality feature extraction, and iterative noise management reflects a comprehensive strategy that appears to effectively tackle the limitations of previous models in this domain. The application of controlled noise addition offers potential for improved exploration of the solution space, which is critical in combinatorial optimization scenarios like TSP. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The blending of diffusion models with NAR techniques provides a fresh perspective and could pave the way for subsequent research in related optimization fields. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments conducted against both real-world and large-scale instances bolster the credibility of the results and the proposed methods. 3. **Code Availability**: Providing access to the implementation encourages reproducibility and further experimentation by other researchers. However, certain aspects raise questions: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results show improvement over existing methods, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of the limitations of autoregressive models and how DEITSP addresses these more directly. 2. **Generalizability**: The implications of the proposed method on problems beyond TSP or in different contexts are not thoroughly discussed, leaving uncertainty about the broader applicability. Given these observations, I assign a score of **8**. The paper marks a noteworthy contribution to the field by addressing a relevant problem with an innovative method that shows promise for better performance than traditional approaches. Nevertheless, more explorative comparisons and a discussion on the generalization of results could strengthen its impact and future applicability.  Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted engineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

While investigation into security issues surrounding text and vision-language models has been comprehensive, the effects of audio-specific edits on LALMs remain largely unexamined. This study addresses this gap by utilizing an Audio Editing Toolbox (AET) that allows modifications such as tone adjustments, word emphasis, and noise injection. The authors also introduce Edited Audio Datasets (EADs) as a new benchmark for assessing the influence of these audio edits. Through detailed evaluations of leading LALMs, the research assesses their robustness in the face of these manipulations, contributing foundational knowledge for future studies on audio interaction security in LALMs. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant and timely investigation into a relatively unexplored area of multimodal artificial intelligence, focusing on the security implications of LALMs. The introduction of the AET and EADs addresses a crucial need for tools and benchmarks in studying audio manipulability, thus expanding the existing literature beyond text and vision. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** By focusing explicitly on audio modalities in jailbreak contexts, this paper fills a critical gap in current research. It shifts attention from predominately text-oriented studies to an area that is increasingly relevant as audio-based applications grow. 2. **Methodology:** The proposal of both a toolbox and datasets specifically designed for audio edits represents a methodological advancement in the field, allowing for repeatable experiments that further validate the findings. 3. **Implications for Security:** Understanding how specific audio edits can exploit LALMs is an essential insight for developing models that are resilient to such manipulations, influencing research and practice in AI safety. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Technical Depth:** While the practical tools introduced (AET and EADs) are promising, the paper may benefit from a deeper technical analysis or case studies demonstrating tangible improvements in robustness based on the insights gained. 2. **Scope of Evaluation:** Outputs from LALMs should be scrutinized not only for robustness but also for qualitative aspects of harmfulness; a broader evaluation could enhance the paper's validity and practical relevance. 3. **Interdisciplinary Context:** The work could benefit from a more extensive discussion on the implications of audio edits compared to other modalities. This could aid in establishing a more comprehensive view of multimodal security. In light of these observations, the paper represents an important advancement in understanding the security risks associated with LALMs and lays a solid foundation for future research in the area. Although it has areas that could be improved, the novelty and timely emergence of this research justify a high score. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the geometric abilities of large language models (LLMs) and presents the GeomRel dataset, specifically designed to evaluate the understanding of geometric structures rather than merely the ability to arrive at correct answers. By concentrating on geometric relationship identification, the authors evaluate multiple LLMs and pinpoint significant gaps in their comprehension of spatial concepts. Additionally, the paper proposes the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) methodology, which improves LLM performance in identifying geometric relationships, demonstrating notable advancements in understanding spatial reasoning. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces several compelling contributions to the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning, particularly in the understanding of geometry by LLMs. A novel aspect is the GeomRel dataset, which fills a critical gap in existing evaluations by focusing on the process of geometric reasoning rather than the correctness of answers alone. This alignment with deeper understanding fosters a more meaningful assessment of LLM capabilities. Furthermore, the GeoCoT method showcases a practical application designed to improve those capabilities, suggesting a route for future enhancements in model training and evaluation. However, there are some drawbacks that temper the paper's impact. The primary weakness lies in the evaluation methodology â while it identifies limitations in LLMs, it does not explore how these models can adaptively improve their geometric understanding beyond the GeoCoT framework. Moreover, the broader implications of these findings for LLM applications in real-world scenarios remain underexplored.  Overall, the research is novel in its premise and offers valuable insights into the capabilities of LLMs with respect to geometry, suggesting potential pathways for development. The significance of the findings in fostering a better comprehension of spatial reasoning within LLMs and the introduction of a specialized dataset are noteworthy accomplishments. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, striking a balance between novelty and practical application, while recognizing the limitations and the need for further exploration in the domain of geometric understanding by language models.
- **Abstract**: Geometric ability is a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for advanced spatial comprehension and abstract thinking. Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.

- **Abstract**: We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions. We propose three main components in our framework: (1) A novel user data recording schema, called User Action Descriptor (UAD), that can capture the users' multimodal actions, along with their intents and the contexts; (2) a platform-agnostic XR session recorder, and (3) a visual analytics interface that offers LLM-assisted insights tailored to the analysts' perspectives, facilitating the exploration and analysis of the recorded XR session data. We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.

### **[Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13779v1)**
- **Authors**: Tanya Rodchenko, Natasha Noy, Nino Scherrer, Jennifer Prendki
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling" argues that the influx of data needed for training Large Language Models (LLMs) should not be approached indiscriminately. Instead, researchers should prioritize specific tasks that are more likely to yield improvements from data scaling. The authors emphasize that the structure and topology of the data can guide this intentionality in data acquisition and suggest that understanding these factors will influence the development of future computational paradigms, especially for tasks where increasing data may not necessarily lead to better outcomes. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a compelling perspective on the growing reliance on data in AI, particularly in training LLMs. By advocating for a more strategic, topology-driven approach to data acquisition, it challenges the prevailing notion that simply accumulating more data will result in enhanced model performance. This notion has been implicit in much of the literature but not strongly articulated. This focus on the relationship between data structure and task efficiency represents a meaningful contribution to the discourse on data-driven AI development. **Significance:** The implications of this work extend to both academic research and practical applications in AI. By changing how researchers and practitioners think about data scaling and its relationship to task effectiveness, the paper could foster a paradigm shift in data acquisition strategies. It addresses an important gap where the sheer volume of data often overshadows qualitative considerations that could lead to more efficient model training processes. **Strengths:** - The paper effectively identifies a critical issue in the AI field: the often uncritical accumulation of large datasets. - It builds a theoretical framework around which tasks should be prioritized for data scaling, which could guide future research. - The discussion about the topology of data opens avenues for exploration into whether all data is equally useful across different tasks. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper poses valuable questions, it could benefit from concrete examples or case studies that illustrate its claims regarding efficient versus inefficient data scaling. - The methodology for assessing which tasks are computationally intensive and which are not is not fully fleshed out, limiting its practical applicability. - The paper might risk oversimplifying the challenges associated with data scaling by suggesting hierarchy without adequately addressing the complexities involved. Overall, while the theoretical foundation and practical implications of the paper are strong, the lack of empirical evidence and specific methodologies presents a limitation. The call for intentionality in data scaling is laudable but needs elaboration on how stakeholders can implement these ideas. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's significant conceptual contribution and potential impact on the field while recognizing its limitations in empirical grounding and practical guidance.
- **Abstract**: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the topology of data itself informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.

### **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction" focuses on improving mobile traffic prediction, which is critical for network optimization and urban planning. Given the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, caused by human behaviors and environmental changes, it often presents both predictable patterns and sudden fluctuations. While current methods emphasize the development of advanced denoising networks, the authors argue that understanding and effectively utilizing noise is equally vital for enhancing prediction accuracy. They introduce a new framework called NPDiff that distinguishes between noise as a prior component derived from data dynamics and residual noise. This separation allows NPDiff to better model the complexities of mobile traffic, leading to significant performance enhancements. Experimental results indicate that NPDiff surpasses previous models by over 30%, suggesting a potential shift in how diffusion models can be applied in this area of research. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Perspective on Noise:** The paper brings attention to a relatively unexplored aspect of mobile traffic predictionâthe role of noise as a contributing factor rather than merely a nuisance. This approach could inspire future research directions, potentially changing the foundational understanding of noise in predictive modeling. 2. **Framework Contribution:** The proposed NPDiff framework, which segments noise into prior and residual components, adds a new dimension to the functionality of diffusion models, making it a notable advancement in the field of network traffic prediction. 3. **Significant Performance Improvement:** The reported performance improvements of over 30% in predictive accuracy substantiate the proposed methodology, indicating a practical application of the theory and a strong validation of the authors' claims. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation:** The paper could benefit from a more robust theoretical underpinning explaining why treating noise in this way enhances predictive capability, particularly in comparison to traditional methods. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** While extensive experiments showcase superior performance, the results would be stronger with a broader comparison across various existing frameworks, ideally in multiple real-world scenarios, to contextualize the benefits of NPDiff comprehensively. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The practicality of implementing this novel approach at scale, particularly in real-time mobile traffic systems, remains uncertain and could be a subject of further exploration. ### Influence on the Field The paper contributes an innovative perspective on an established area, proposing an intriguing methodology that could influence the way researchers and practitioners approach mobile traffic prediction. By centering the discussion on the roles of noise, it opens avenues for future explorations and enhancements of diffusion models beyond the presented case. The significant improvements reported could also stimulate interest and subsequent studies focusing on similar noise-related dynamics across different domains. **Score:** 8 **Rationale for the Score:** The score of 8 reflects a solid contribution to the field, particularly with its novel emphasis on noise and impressive performance outcomes. However, the absence of a strong theoretical framework and limited comparative analysis limit its overall impact and applicability. The paper's approach is significant enough to warrant attention and inspire further research, yet there are areas for improvement and deeper exploration, which prevent it from achieving a perfect score.
- **Abstract**: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.

- **Classification**: cs.CY
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper examines the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in combating climate misinformation rather than exacerbating the issue. It assesses the performance of both proprietary and open-source LLMs in classifying climate misinformation using a well-annotated expert dataset and a selection of social media content. Key findings indicate that state-of-the-art open-source models significantly lag behind proprietary ones in this domain. Additionally, existing computer-assisted tools surpass several proprietary models in performance, including GPT-4o. Notably, fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert data allows it to achieve classification accuracy comparable to seasoned climate communication professionals. The study underscores the necessity of human oversight in training LLMs for governance roles, particularly in specialized fields like climate change, and suggests potential applications of LLMs for civil society in addressing misinformation across various domains. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper contributes meaningfully to the discourse on LLMs and their appropriateness for handling specialized tasks necessitating expert knowledge. Its innovative approach lies in the comparative analysis of proprietary and open-source models using an expert-annotated dataset, addressing a pressing concern regarding the implications of LLMs in misinformation.  **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The pressing issue of climate misinformation is increasingly critical in today's socio-political landscape. 2. **Methodology:** The use of expert-annotated datasets enhances the credibility of the results and directly addresses a gap in existing techniques by incorporating domain expertise. 3. **Practical Findings:** Demonstrating that fine-tuning LLMs significantly improves performance showcases the actionable nature of the research, which can influence both policy and technology development. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the study focuses on climate misinformation, the findings may not directly translate to other domains of misinformation, such as politics or health, as complexities differ. 2. **Limitations of Open-Source Models:** The study notes the performance gap without sufficiently exploring the innovative aspects of open-source models or their potential when adequately fine-tuned. 3. **Dependency on Human Oversight:** While human oversight is highlighted as beneficial, the paper could delve deeper into the challenges and logistics of maintaining and integrating such oversight into LLM training processes. **Overall Assessment:** Given the paper's substantial contributions to both the understanding of LLM capabilities in governance contexts and the methodologies for countering misinformation, it is a noteworthy work that raises critical questions and offers viable solutions. However, the limitations regarding generalization and depth of exploration of open-source potential reduce the impact somewhat. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Climate misinformation is a problem that has the potential to be substantially aggravated by the development of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this study we evaluate the potential for LLMs to be part of the solution for mitigating online dis/misinformation rather than the problem. Employing a public expert annotated dataset and a curated sample of social media content we evaluate the performance of proprietary vs. open source LLMs on climate misinformation classification task, comparing them to existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools and expert assessments. Results show (1) state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models substantially under-perform in classifying climate misinformation compared to proprietary models, (2) existing climate-focused computer-assisted tools leveraging expert-annotated datasets continues to outperform many of proprietary models, including GPT-4o, and (3) demonstrate the efficacy and generalizability of fine-tuning GPT-3.5-turbo on expert annotated dataset in classifying claims about climate change at the equivalency of climate change experts with over 20 years of experience in climate communication. These findings highlight 1) the importance of incorporating human-oversight, such as incorporating expert-annotated datasets in training LLMs, for governance tasks that require subject-matter expertise like classifying climate misinformation, and 2) the potential for LLMs in facilitating civil society organizations to engage in various governance tasks such as classifying false or misleading claims in domains beyond climate change such as politics and health science.

### **[Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13816v1)**
- **Authors**: Jie Wang, Alexandros Karatzoglou, Ioannis Arapakis, Joemon M. Jose
- **Classification**: cs.IR
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Large Language Model driven Policy Exploration for Recommender Systems" addresses challenges faced by Reinforcement Learning (RL) in Recommender Systems (RS), specifically regarding distribution shifts and the balance between exploration and exploitation. It proposes a new approach called Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP), which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to pre-train offline policies based on user preferences. The method extracts item preferences from user states, learns rewards through user feedback, and updates the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. To enable effective online deployment, the paper introduces an adaptive version, A-iALP, consisting of fine-tuning (A-iALP$_{ft}$) and adaptive (A-iALP$_{ap}$) strategies aimed at resolving issues linked to unstable policies and insufficient exploration. Experimental results indicate that A-iALP significantly enhances performance across simulated environments. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of LLMs with RL-based RS to improve initial policy recommendations and address the inherent challenges of offline RL when placed in dynamic online environments. By focusing on user preference extraction through LLMs, the authors provide a fresh perspective on how to tackle exploration-exploitation trade-offs effectively. This is particularly significant due to the growing interest in utilizing LLMs in various domains. However, there are some potential weaknesses to consider. Firstly, the experiments are conducted in simulated environments, which may not fully capture the complexities and variability of real-world RS challenges. The performance improvements, though substantial in simulations, require further validation in practical implementations. Additionally, the paper does not deeply explore the limitations or computational costs associated with the proposed LLM augmentation methods, which could be significant when scaling to larger user bases. Overall, the paper contributes new methodologies to the field of RS and addresses critical issues that are prevalent in current systems. It opens avenues for further research on the combination of LLMs with RL. Considering these aspects, I assess the paper's novelty and significance as an 8. The approach is innovative and practical, but the dependency on simulated data and lack of exhaustive exploration of limitations might inhibit immediate applicability. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Recommender Systems (RS) have incorporated Reinforcement Learning (RL), framing the recommendation as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, offline RL policies trained on static user data are vulnerable to distribution shift when deployed in dynamic online environments. Additionally, excessive focus on exploiting short-term relevant items can hinder exploration, leading to suboptimal recommendations and negatively impacting long-term user gains. Online RL-based RS also face challenges in production deployment, due to the risks of exposing users to untrained or unstable policies. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to mimic user objectives and preferences for pre-training policies offline to enhance the initial recommendations in online settings. Effectively managing distribution shift and balancing exploration are crucial for improving RL-based RS, especially when leveraging LLM-based pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose an Interaction-Augmented Learned Policy (iALP) that utilizes user preferences distilled from an LLM. Our approach involves prompting the LLM with user states to extract item preferences, learning rewards based on feedback, and updating the RL policy using an actor-critic framework. Furthermore, to deploy iALP in an online scenario, we introduce an adaptive variant, A-iALP, that implements a simple fine-tuning strategy (A-iALP$_{ft}$), and an adaptive approach (A-iALP$_{ap}$) designed to mitigate issues with compromised policies and limited exploration. Experiments across three simulated environments demonstrate that A-iALP introduces substantial performance improvements

- **Authors**: Shuzhou Yuan, Michael FÃ¤rber
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Hallucinations Can Improve Large Language Models in Drug Discovery" explores the potential benefits of hallucinationsâunintended outputs not directly grounded in factual dataâproduced by large language models (LLMs) in the context of drug discovery. The authors hypothesize that these hallucinations can enhance the performance of LLMs on specific drug discovery tasks. They conducted an experiment utilizing seven different LLMs and five classification tasks, demonstrating that integrating hallucinated descriptions of molecular SMILES strings into LLM prompts leads to improved performance. Particularly, Llama-3.1-8B shows a significant 18.35% increase in ROC-AUC scores compared to a baseline devoid of hallucinations. The paper highlights GPT-4o's hallucinations as offering the most robust improvements. Additionally, the authors carried out empirical analyses and a case study to understand the nuances influencing model performance. The main contribution lies in demonstrating that, in certain creative domains like drug discovery, hallucinations from LLMs might not only be harmless but could also be advantageous. ### Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The paper challenges conventional views about hallucinations in LLMs, proposing that they can have a beneficial role in creative and exploratory tasks such as drug discovery. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide substantial empirical evidence supporting their hypothesis, showing measurable performance gains across multiple models and tasks. 3. **Relevance:** With the growing interest in utilizing AI for drug discovery, this research is timely and addresses a significant area within the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the paper shows improvements in specific tasks, the results may not generalize across all types of drug discovery or to other fields. The research is somewhat limited in scope. 2. **Mechanistic Understanding:** The paper lacks a robust theoretical framework explaining why hallucinations contribute to improved performance. More insight into the mechanisms by which these hallucinations enhance LLM functioning would strengthen the findings. 3. **Focus on Specific Models:** The analysis centers around a limited number of LLMs, which may lead to questions about the applicability of the findings to a broader array of models and methodologies in drug discovery. **Impact on the Field:** The implications of this research are significant, as it opens new avenues for utilizing LLMs in drug discovery, particularly in areas requiring innovative thought. If further validated, this could reshape how researchers view the role of hallucinations in AI applications, suggesting a model where, rather than merely being flagged as undesirable, such outputs could lead to creative breakthroughs. Considering the combination of its novel perspective, empirical basis, and relevance to a growing domain, while also acknowledging the limitations in terms of generalizability and mechanism derivation: **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Concerns about hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been raised by researchers, yet their potential in areas where creativity is vital, such as drug discovery, merits exploration. In this paper, we come up with the hypothesis that hallucinations can improve LLMs in drug discovery. To verify this hypothesis, we use LLMs to describe the SMILES string of molecules in natural language and then incorporate these descriptions as part of the prompt to address specific tasks in drug discovery. Evaluated on seven LLMs and five classification tasks, our findings confirm the hypothesis: LLMs can achieve better performance with text containing hallucinations. Notably, Llama-3.1-8B achieves an 18.35% gain in ROC-AUC compared to the baseline without hallucination. Furthermore, hallucinations generated by GPT-4o provide the most consistent improvements across models. Additionally, we conduct empirical analyses and a case study to investigate key factors affecting performance and the underlying reasons. Our research sheds light on the potential use of hallucinations for LLMs and offers new perspectives for future research leveraging LLMs in drug discovery.

### **[Predicting Compact Phrasal Rewrites with Large Language Models for ASR Post Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13831v1)**
- **Authors**: Hao Zhang, Felix Stahlberg, Shankar Kumar
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for rewriting tasks, particularly focusing on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post-editing. It notes the inefficiencies inherent in decoding lengthy outputs despite potential overlaps between input and output, paralleling prior work by Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) that introduced model-agnostic edit span representations for compressing rewrites. The authors propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation, comparing their phrasal approach to the previous span representations. The findings demonstrate that their target-phrase-only edit representation achieves an efficient balance between accuracy and computational expense, illustrated by a 50-60% reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) on the LibriSpeech test set compared to the span model, while maintaining a significant length reduction. **Evaluation:** The paper presents noteworthy contributions to the field of LLM applications in ASR post-editing. One of its key strengths lies in the novel approach of phrasal representations, which provide a viable alternative to existing span-based techniques. This represents an advancement in improving the efficiency of LLMs in rewriting tasks, crucial given the computational demand of larger models. However, while the modification and comparison are methodologically sound, the innovation may not be radically transformative; it builds upon prior work and may not introduce fundamentally new ideas beyond the adaptations from statistical machine translation principles. The paperâs actual contribution to the efficiency-accuracy trade-off could also benefit from more comprehensive quantitative evaluations across a wider range of datasets and tasks beyond LibriSpeech. The practical implications focus on improving efficiency in ASR systems. Still, the margin of improvement in WER could be seen as modest given the prominent challenges in ASR accuracy improvement across diverse applications, which may limit the immediate applicability of the findings. In summary, the paper offers a solid expansion of the body of knowledge regarding LLMs in ASR contexts, demonstrating clear applicability and improvement therein. Nonetheless, its reliance on adaptations of pre-existing concepts and potential limitations in broader applicability reduce its overall novelty. Thus, I assign a score of 7/10. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at rewriting tasks such as text style transfer and grammatical error correction. While there is considerable overlap between the inputs and outputs in these tasks, the decoding cost still increases with output length, regardless of the amount of overlap. By leveraging the overlap between the input and the output, Kaneko and Okazaki (2023) proposed model-agnostic edit span representations to compress the rewrites to save computation. They reported an output length reduction rate of nearly 80% with minimal accuracy impact in four rewriting tasks. In this paper, we propose alternative edit phrase representations inspired by phrase-based statistical machine translation. We systematically compare our phrasal representations with their span representations. We apply the LLM rewriting model to the task of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) post editing and show that our target-phrase-only edit representation has the best efficiency-accuracy trade-off. On the LibriSpeech test set, our method closes 50-60% of the WER gap between the edit span model and the full rewrite model while losing only 10-20% of the length reduction rate of the edit span model.

- **Authors**: Santosh Kumar Radha, Oktay Goktas
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "On the Reasoning Capacity of AI Models and How to Quantify It" addresses the ongoing discussion surrounding the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). While these models perform well on various benchmarks, they struggle with complex reasoning tasks, prompting the authors to propose a new evaluation framework. This framework focuses on understanding the models' reasoning mechanisms beyond mere accuracy. The authors demonstrate this approach using positional bias in multiple-choice tasks, introducing two complementary models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that categorizes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing, and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis to quantify model confidence versus strategy selection. Their findings indicate that LLMs often fail to engage in true reasoning, relying instead on memorization and pattern matching. The paper calls for the use of quantitative criteria for evaluating AI applications, suggesting a need to define reliability thresholds in terms of cognitive strategy distributions rather than just performance metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions. Firstly, it identifies a significant gap in the existing evaluation methodologies for LLMs by highlighting their reasoning limitations. Furthermore, it proposes a novel phenomenological approach that encompasses a deeper analysis of model behavior through a mixture of theoretical models, which is a constructive step toward understanding reasoning in AI systems. In terms of novelty, the integration of PMM and ITC analysis offers a fresh perspective on how AI models operate, shedding light on their underlying mechanics. This dual approach is commendable and demonstrates an innovative method for dissecting model behavior in a rigorous manner, which is necessary for advancing AI evaluation. However, the paper does have its weaknesses. The implementation details of the proposed models might lack depth, which could hinder reproducibility and practical application. Additionally, while the authors emphasize the dual approach's theoretical impact, empirical results might be limited, and the discussions could benefit from a broader context of how these findings compare to existing methodologies in AI evaluation. Moreover, while the analysis focuses on reasoning, it could have included practical implications or case studies showcasing how this framework could be utilized in real-world scenarios, enhancing its relevance. Overall, despite these limitations, the paper's contribution is significant, as it provides a pathway for more nuanced assessments of AI reasoning capabilities, addressing a crucial area of research. Thus, while it may not be groundbreaking, it is an important advancement in the ongoing quest to demystify AI reasoning. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have intensified the debate surrounding the fundamental nature of their reasoning capabilities. While achieving high performance on benchmarks such as GPQA and MMLU, these models exhibit limitations in more complex reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for more rigorous evaluation methodologies. We propose a novel phenomenological approach that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to probe the underlying mechanisms of model behavior, establishing a framework that could broadly impact how we analyze and understand AI systems. Using positional bias in multiple-choice reasoning tasks as a case study, we demonstrate how systematic perturbations can reveal fundamental aspects of model decision-making. To analyze these behaviors, we develop two complementary phenomenological models: a Probabilistic Mixture Model (PMM) that decomposes model responses into reasoning, memorization, and guessing components and an Information-Theoretic Consistency (ITC) analysis that quantifies the relationship between model confidence and strategy selection. Through controlled experiments on reasoning benchmarks, we show that true reasoning remains challenging for current models, with apparent success often relying on sophisticated combinations of memorization and pattern matching rather than genuine logical deduction. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that accuracy alone often overstates a model's reasoning abilities, as model behavior can be characterized through underlying mechanisms in the phase space of cognitive strategies, revealing how models dynamically balance different approaches when responding to queries. This framework enables quantitative criteria for real-world deployments, allowing applications to specify reliability thresholds based on strategy distributions rather than aggregate performance metrics.

- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "A RAG-Based Institutional Assistant" addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in handling knowledge-intensive tasks that require access to structured databases or specific document content. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model designed for the University of SÃ£o Paulo, which combines a retriever module and a generative model. The study experimentally evaluates various models for both components and optimizes hyperparameters, achieving a Top-5 accuracy of 30% for the retriever and 22.04% for the generative model against ground truth answers. Notably, the study finds that when relevant document chunks are provided to LLMs, their accuracy improves significantly (to 54.02%), indicating the necessity of direct knowledge access for effective generative performance. Conversely, without context, performance drops to 13.68%, underscoring the importance of well-tuned retrieval mechanisms. ### Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about enhancing LLMs with retrieval mechanisms, a relevant and timely topic given the rapid advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The integration of a RAG framework for a specific institutional context, such as the University of SÃ£o Paulo, adds a layer of applied research that is often underexplored. However, the concept of retrieval-augmented models is not entirely novel, as similar works exist in the literature, indicating that while the study is relevant, it may not significantly advance theoretical frameworks. **Significance:** The findings presented in this work indicate the crucial role that structured document access plays in the performance of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks. The clear performance distinctions documented in terms of retrieval efficacy are commendable, providing valuable insights for future research. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of alternative retrieval techniques and broader applications beyond a singular institutional assistant. **Strengths:**  - The empirical evaluation presents a structured approach to assessing LLM performance in conjunction with retrieval mechanisms, providing tangible metrics that can guide further research. - The focus on a specific institutional application may aid in practical implementation and offer a foundation for other educational institutions to develop similar tools. **Weaknesses:**  - The paper's discussion on current semantic search limitations lacks depth, missing an opportunity to contextualize findings with existing literature, thus reducing potential implications for advancing semantic search methodologies. - Insights into how the retriever model could be improved or further optimized are sparse, which could enhance the utility of the research for practitioners and researchers alike. **Overall Assessment:** While the paper provides a focused exploration of an emerging area of research and presents compelling experimental results, its contributions to the broader field of LLMs and retrieval systems may not be groundbreaking enough to warrant high praise. The practical implications of the findings for education and institutional use are significant, but the novelty is somewhat diminished by the existing body of knowledge in RAG frameworks. Score: 6
- **Abstract**: Although large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong text generation capabilities, they struggle in scenarios requiring access to structured knowledge bases or specific documents, limiting their effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models have been developed, enabling generative models to incorporate relevant document fragments into their inputs. In this paper, we design and evaluate a RAG-based virtual assistant specifically tailored for the University of S\~ao Paulo. Our system architecture comprises two key modules: a retriever and a generative model. We experiment with different types of models for both components, adjusting hyperparameters such as chunk size and the number of retrieved documents. Our optimal retriever model achieves a Top-5 accuracy of 30%, while our most effective generative model scores 22.04\% against ground truth answers. Notably, when the correct document chunks are supplied to the LLMs, accuracy significantly improves to 54.02%, an increase of over 30 percentage points. Conversely, without contextual input, performance declines to 13.68%. These findings highlight the critical role of database access in enhancing LLM performance. They also reveal the limitations of current semantic search methods in accurately identifying relevant documents and underscore the ongoing challenges LLMs face in generating precise responses.

### **[Utilizing Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13883v1)**
- **Authors**: MatyÃ¡Å¡ Lorenc
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the application of evolution strategies (ES) for training agents with decision-making policies based on transformer architectures in reinforcement learning (RL). Using OpenAI's evolution strategy, the authors conducted experiments in two environments: Humanoid locomotion and Atari games. They explored the viability of ES as a black-box optimization method for training complex models, including the Decision Transformer. A notable contribution is the introduction of a pretraining phase prior to the application of ES, which, although shown to be generally unnecessary for achieving strong performance, provided insights into the training process. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of ES in producing high-performing agents. **Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions, particularly in combining advanced ES techniques with transformers, which adds to the body of knowledge in both RL and evolutionary algorithms. However, several factors warrant a critical assessment: 1. **Novelty**: While the application of ES to transformer architectures is interesting, the approach itself is not entirely novel within the broader field of RL and optimization algorithms. Progress has been made in related domains exploring similar methodologies. The novelty primarily lies in demonstrating its effectiveness in more complex scenarios (like Transformers), yet this remains a relatively incremental step. 2. **Methodological Robustness**: The experiments conducted in well-defined environments (Humanoid locomotion and Atari) are a strength, indicating that the techniques may have practical applicability. However, the lack of a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art RL approaches or detail on hyperparameter optimization raises questions about the robustness of the findings. 3. **Insights and Practical Implications**: The observations regarding the pretraining phase, while highlighting potential insights gained, are somewhat diluted by the conclusion that pretraining was shown as unnecessary. This contradiction may detract from the practical implications of the findings, limiting their usefulness for practitioners in the field. 4. **Impact**: The contribution appears to extend existing knowledge on ES in RL but lacks significant disruptive potential or revolutionary insights that could reshape current methodologies in RL training. The paper could stimulate further research but does not fundamentally shift paradigms. In conclusion, while the paper has merits in its approach and execution, its contributions to the fields of RL and ES are more incremental rather than groundbreaking. Thus, the paper is evaluated with a score reflecting its moderate impact and significance. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: We explore a capability of evolution strategies to train an agent with its policy based on a transformer architecture in a reinforcement learning setting. We performed experiments using OpenAI's highly parallelizable evolution strategy to train Decision Transformer in Humanoid locomotion environment and in the environment of Atari games, testing the ability of this black-box optimization technique to train even such relatively large and complicated models (compared to those previously tested in the literature). We also proposed a method to aid the training by first pretraining the model before using the OpenAI-ES to train it further, and tested its effectiveness. The examined evolution strategy proved to be, in general, capable of achieving strong results and managed to obtain high-performing agents. Therefore, the pretraining was shown to be unnecessary; yet still, it helped us observe and formulate several further insights.

- **Authors**: Adrian Florea, Xilin Jiang, Nima Mesgarani, Xiaofan Jiang
- **Classification**: eess.AS
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Exploring Finetuned Audio-LLM on Heart Murmur Features" investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) for the analysis of heart sounds, specifically phonocardiograms (PCGs), in the context of diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Despite the success of LLMs in areas like speech and music recognition, their application in biomedical sound analysis remains significantly underexplored. The authors propose finetuning the Qwen2-Audio model on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope dataset to classify 11 heart murmur features, advancing beyond traditional deep neural networks which mainly differentiate between healthy and unhealthy murmurs. Furthermore, they introduce a preprocessing segmentation algorithm to enhance noise robustness and generalization. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based model surpasses state-of-the-art approaches for 8 of the 11 features, managing to classify long-tail features that previous techniques struggled with. This suggests a promising role for audio LLMs in assisting cardiologists with heart disease diagnosis. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper's novelty lies in its application of a fine-tuned audio LLM to classify detailed acoustic features of heart murmurs, extending beyond the basic healthy/unhealthy classification typical of existing approaches. By focusing on nuanced characteristics like timing and pitch, the authors address an important gap in biomedical sound analysis. The methodology also includes a novel preprocessing step that enhances the model's robustness against noise, which is a common challenge in real-world clinical settings.  **Strengths:** - The study employs state-of-the-art technology (LLMs) to tackle biomedical sound analysis, potentially revolutionizing the detection and diagnosis of heart conditions. - It demonstrates superior performance in classifying a range of murmur features, especially underrepresented ones, which highlights the model's broader applicability. - The combination of LLMs and innovative preprocessing techniques creates a comprehensive approach that is well-positioned to adapt to real-world clinical data, which is often noisy and incomplete. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a comparative analysis with more diverse datasets, as reliance on a single dataset may limit the generalizability of the modelâs findings. - While the performance metrics are promising, the study does not delve deeply into the implications of misclassifications, particularly in clinical practice, which is crucial for understanding potential risks. - The paper does not sufficiently discuss the need for validation in a clinical environment, which is essential before implementing such models in routine diagnostics. **Potential Influence:** This research exemplifies the intersection of machine learning and clinical practice and emphasizes the need for contemporary analytic approaches in healthcare. Should the findings hold in diverse clinical environments, the potential for LLMs to assist in diagnostic processes could be transformative, paving the way for more personalized medicine. The research also opens avenues for further studies on using LLMs in other areas of biomedical sound analysis. Based on the strengths and weaknesses evaluated, the paper shows significant contributions to the field with a robust application of AI in healthcare. However, more comprehensive validation and broader applications are needed for it to be fully impactful. ### Overall Score: 8 **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) for audio have excelled in recognizing and analyzing human speech, music, and environmental sounds. However, their potential for understanding other types of sounds, particularly biomedical sounds, remains largely underexplored despite significant scientific interest. In this study, we focus on diagnosing cardiovascular diseases using phonocardiograms, i.e., heart sounds. Most existing deep neural network (DNN) paradigms are restricted to heart murmur classification (healthy vs unhealthy) and do not predict other acoustic features of the murmur such as timing, grading, harshness, pitch, and quality, which are important in helping physicians diagnose the underlying heart conditions. We propose to finetune an audio LLM, Qwen2-Audio, on the PhysioNet CirCor DigiScope phonocardiogram (PCG) dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying 11 expert-labeled murmur features. Additionally, we aim to achieve more noise-robust and generalizable system by exploring a preprocessing segmentation algorithm using an audio representation model, SSAMBA. Our results indicate that the LLM-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 8 of the 11 features and performs comparably in the remaining 3. Moreover, the LLM successfully classifies long-tail murmur features with limited training data, a task that all previous methods have failed to classify. These findings underscore the potential of audio LLMs as assistants to human cardiologists in enhancing heart disease diagnosis.

### **[Privacy-Preserving Personalized Federated Prompt Learning for Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13904v1)**
- **Authors**: Linh Tran, Wei Sun, Stacy Patterson, Ana Milanova
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach called Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL), designed to enhance the personalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) while ensuring privacy. This is particularly relevant in applications like customer support, where the integration of various modalities (text, image, audio) is crucial. The authors identify the challenge of maintaining a balance between personalization and generalization without compromising user privacy. To address this, they utilize a low-rank adaptation scheme that allows for effective generalization, while incorporating a residual term for personalization. They implement a method that applies local differential privacy to the low-rank components of local prompts and global differential privacy to the global prompts to enhance privacy while reducing the detrimental effects of privacy noise on model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DP-FPL method outperforms existing benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in achieving the delicate balance of personalization, generalization, and privacy. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of federated learning with differencing approaches to privacy in the context of multimodal LLMs. While federated learning and differential privacy have both been previously explored in isolation, this paper successfully combines them to address the emerging challenge of personalization in AI systems. The application of a low-rank adaptation scheme is a clever way to maintain generalization, a significant contribution that could influence further research in this area. However, the paper does have some strengths and weaknesses. A notable strength is its thorough experimental validation, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach against established benchmarks, which adds rigor to its claims. Furthermore, the systematic treatment of privacy concerns is commendable, given the increasing importance of user privacy in AI. On the downside, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational overhead introduced by the proposed method, as federated learning can inherently be resource-intensive. Additionally, the scalability of the method to larger datasets and more complex tasks remains to be fully assessed, which is a crucial aspect when considering deployment in real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper provides a meaningful contribution to the field by addressing critical challenges in privacy, personalization, and generalization within multimodal LLMs.  **Score: 8.**   This score reflects the paper's solid contributions and its potential impact on future research in privacy-preserving AI systems, while noting that more detailed evaluations of computational aspects and scalability could further enhance its significance.
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.

The authors propose a comprehensive pipeline that integrates human feedback to enhance video generation models. Initially, they create a large-scale human preference dataset centered on modern video generation, which includes multi-dimensional pairwise annotations. The core innovation is the introduction of VideoReward, a reward model that incorporates these annotations. The paper explores the impact of different design choices on the effectiveness of rewards. It presents three novel alignment algorithms for flow-based models, derived from diffusion model strategies: Flow-DPO (direct preference optimization), Flow-RWR (reward weighted regression), and Flow-NRG (inference-time reward guidance). Experimental findings demonstrate that VideoReward surpasses existing models significantly, with Flow-DPO leading in performance. Flow-NRG facilitates user customization of objective weights during inference, enhancing personalization in video generation. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The work introduces several key innovations, including a large-scale human preference dataset specific to video generation and the VideoReward model. The adaptation of alignment algorithms from diffusion models to flow-based models is particularly noteworthy and reflects creative integration across methodologies. The authors also address a critical gap in the current video generation landscapeâperformance issues when aligning generated videos with promptsâby leveraging human feedback, which has not been extensively explored in prior works.  **Significance**: The significance of this research is substantial as it offers a meaningful contribution to the field of video generation, which faces ongoing challenges related to quality and alignment. By enhancing these areas through user feedback mechanisms, the study paves the way for more sophisticated and user-centered video generation systems, potentially influencing applications in entertainment, education, and personalized content creation. **Strengths**:  - The systematic approach to incorporating human feedback into video generation addresses real-world user needs, making the advancements potentially more applicable and beneficial. - The thorough experimental validation demonstrates clear superiority over existing models and methods, bolstering the claims of the paper. **Weaknesses**:  - While the focus on human feedback is a strong point, the reliance on a human preference dataset could raise questions about scalability and generalizability. The need for extensive human annotations may limit the applicability of the proposed methods in more resource-constrained settings. - The paper may not sufficiently address how different dimensions of user preference interact and how this can be effectively normalized or balanced in practice.  **Potential Impact**: Given the direction in which video generation is headed, this paper's methods and findings hold the potential to inform future developments, leading to enhanced usability and performance. However, the need for human feedback could be seen as a double-edged sword, requiring ongoing effort to curate datasets and manage the computational complexity involved. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a strong contribution to the field with several innovative elements and a systematic approach.

The paper is well-positioned to influence future research and application in video generation, making it a relevant and impactful addition to the literature.
- **Abstract**: Video generation has achieved significant advances through rectified flow techniques, but issues like unsmooth motion and misalignment between videos and prompts persist. In this work, we develop a systematic pipeline that harnesses human feedback to mitigate these problems and refine the video generation model. Specifically, we begin by constructing a large-scale human preference dataset focused on modern video generation models, incorporating pairwise annotations across multi-dimensions. We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods. Additionally, Flow-NRG lets users assign custom weights to multiple objectives during inference, meeting personalized video quality needs. Project page: https://gongyeliu.github.io/videoalign.

- **Abstract**: With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models have made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt following and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI tools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future trajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.

- **Authors**: Guofeng Cui, Pichao Wang, Yang Liu, Zemian Ke, Zhu Liu, Vimal Bhat
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CRPO (Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization), a novel approach designed to enhance machine translation by improving data selection through the integration of reward scores and model confidence. The authors argue that the current methods, particularly Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are limited due to their reliance on the quality of preference data. CRPO targets challenging sentence pairs, specifically those where the model shows uncertainty or poor performance, thereby fostering more effective learning. The method is primarily aimed at large language models (LLMs) but is also applicable to encoder-decoder frameworks like NLLB. Empirical results indicate that CRPO surpasses competing methods, such as RS-DPO, RSO, and MBR score, in terms of both translation accuracy and data efficiency. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of machine translation, particularly in the context of LLMs, by addressing a well-recognized limitationâthe effective utilization of preference data in DPO methods. The introduction of a strategy that leverages model uncertainty to prioritize data selection is both innovative and pragmatic, suggesting a clear pathway for enhancing machine translation performance. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The combination of confidence metrics and reward scoring to filter training data is a fresh approach. By focusing on uncertain model predictions, CRPO addresses the shortcomings of current preference optimization methods, which tend to rely on a more generic selection process. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide robust empirical results demonstrating the superiority of CRPO over established methods, lending credibility to their claims. 3. **Versatility**: The ability of CRPO to generalize beyond LLMs to systems like NLLB shows the method's broader applicability in the field of MT. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Underlying Models**: The effectiveness of CRPO still hinges on the quality and architecture of the underlying model. If the baseline model has substantial limitations, CRPO may not yield significant improvements. 2. **Preference Data Quality**: While CRPO addresses the selection of training scenarios, the dependence on initial human feedback quality for training could still pose challenges, especially in low-resource languages or dialects. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: Integrating CRPO into existing workflows may add complexity, which could deter researchers and practitioners who are seeking simpler adaptations. Overall, CRPO exhibits a meaningful contribution to the field of machine translation through its innovative methodology and achieved results. Its emphasis on effectively managing training data based on model confidence can inspire further research into adaptive learning methods. Considering the strengths, weaknesses, and the potential for CRPO to influence future research and practices in machine translation, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. This score reflects a solid contribution with pragmatic implications but acknowledges that the methodâs broader applicability may be constrained by underlying model architectures and data quality issues. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language processing tasks, but their application to machine translation (MT) remains challenging due to pretraining on English-centric data and the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simpler and more efficient alternative, but its performance depends heavily on the quality of preference data. To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility. Empirical results show that CRPO outperforms existing methods such as RS-DPO, RSO and MBR score in both translation accuracy and data efficiency.

- **Authors**: Potito Aghilar, Vito Walter Anelli, Michelantonio Trizio, Tommaso Di Noia
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents FashionRepose, a novel, training-free pipeline designed for non-rigid pose editing of fashion garments. It addresses the limitations of current diffusion models that struggle with maintaining object identity during transformations, particularly within the fashion industry where precision and consistency are essential. By integrating readily available models, FashionRepose enables adjustments to the poses of long-sleeve garments without the need for specialized training data. This zero-shot approach allows for near real-time edits, preserving identity and branding attributes of the garments. The authors highlight the system's potential applications not only in fashion but also in other areas requiring reliable image editing. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The concept of a training-free approach to pose editing is noteworthy. The existing methodologies predominantly rely on custom training, which poses challenges in terms of resource availability and ease of implementation. FashionRepose distinguishes itself by enabling users to apply pose adjustments without the lengthy training processes typically required. However, the exclusiveness of the contribution may be somewhat diminished since the paper builds on already available diffusion models. **Significance**: The significance of the paper in the fashion industry is considerable, given the industry's reliance on visual media and the frequent requirement for pose adjustments to maintain marketing and branding consistency. The immediacy and accessibility offered by the pipeline can potentially transform workflows for fashion designers and marketers. Nonetheless, the focus on long-sleeve garments may limit its applicability to a broader spectrum of clothing types and styles. **Strengths**: - The training-free nature of the approach is a major strength, providing practical utility for users lacking the resources for extensive model training. - The integration of off-the-shelf models adds versatility and ease of implementation. - The near real-time editing capability is a significant advantage for industries operating under tight deadlines. **Weaknesses**: - The application limited to long-sleeve garments raises questions about the adaptability of the pipeline for various clothing types. - The reliance on existing diffusion models may limit innovation, as the method doesn't fundamentally alter the base processes but rather uses them creatively. - The paper may benefit from empirical evidence demonstrating the precision and effectiveness of the method across diverse scenarios and garment types. **Potential Influence**: Given the trajectory of AI in fashion, FashionRepose has the potential to influence both academic research and practical applications in the industry. If successful, it may spark further research into training-free methods and perhaps inspire enhancements to pose editing within other domains. In conclusion, while the paper presents a meaningful contribution with practical implications, its relatively narrow focus on garment type and reliance on pre-existing models limits its novelty and broader applicability.  Score: 7
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly broadened the possibilities for editing images of real-world objects. However, performing non-rigid transformations, such as changing the pose of objects or image-based conditioning, remains challenging. Maintaining object identity during these edits is difficult, and current methods often fall short of the precision needed for industrial applications, where consistency is critical. Additionally, fine-tuning diffusion models requires custom training data, which is not always accessible in real-world scenarios. This work introduces FashionRepose, a training-free pipeline for non-rigid pose editing specifically designed for the fashion industry. The approach integrates off-the-shelf models to adjust poses of long-sleeve garments, maintaining identity and branding attributes. FashionRepose uses a zero-shot approach to perform these edits in near real-time, eliminating the need for specialized training. consistent image editing. The solution holds potential for applications in the fashion industry and other fields demanding identity preservation in image editing.

- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DI-BENCH: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Dependency Inference with Testable Repositories at Scale" introduces a benchmark framework specifically targeting the dependency inference capability of large language models (LLMs) in automated software development. It highlights the critical issue that over 40% of runtime errors in generated software repositories stem from dependency mismanagement. DI-BENCH includes 581 repositories across languages such as Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript, providing both textual and execution-based metrics for evaluation. Experimental results indicate the leading model only achieves a 42.9% execution pass rate, pointing to considerable room for improvement in LLMsâ performance on this crucial aspect of software synthesis. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its establishment of a targeted benchmark (DI-BENCH) for dependency inference, an area that has significant implications for the reliability of software generated by LLMs. By addressing a specific and critical aspect of automated software development, the authors contribute to understanding and potentially mitigating a prevalent issueâruntime errors due to dependency failures. The systematic approach to compile a diverse set of repositories for testing further enhances the framework's applicability and relevance. One of the notable strengths of this paper is its empirical foundation, as it provides both quantitative data and the clear indication that existing models have substantial limitations in this domain, further justifying the need for continued research and development. Moreover, the cross-language approach could foster broader applicability of their findings and methodologies. However, there are weaknesses to consider. The paper does not delve deeply into the methodologies behind the LLMsâ dependency inference capabilities; it primarily focuses on their performance metrics. While the benchmark is a valuable step forward, it could benefit from a discussion of how individual model architectures or training data influence performance in this context. Furthermore, the reported pass rate of 42.9% indicates that the benchmark and existing models are still far from meeting software development needs, thereby questioning the immediacy of its impact on real-world applications. In summary, DI-BENCH is a significant contribution that provides a structured evaluation platform but suggests that the field still has considerable progress to make. Its introduction will likely influence future research agendas focused on improving LLMs for real-world software synthesis tasks. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's relevant innovation in benchmarking LLMs for a critical aspect of software development while recognizing the need for deeper insights into model performance and methodologies. The connection to real-world software issues enhances its significance, but the limitations noted indicate that it is a foundational contribution to an ongoing challenge rather than a sweeping solution.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models have advanced automated software development, however, it remains a challenge to correctly infer dependencies, namely, identifying the internal components and external packages required for a repository to successfully run. Existing studies highlight that dependency-related issues cause over 40\% of observed runtime errors on the generated repository. To address this, we introduce DI-BENCH, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability on dependency inference. The benchmark features 581 repositories with testing environments across Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript. Extensive experiments with textual and execution-based metrics reveal that the current best-performing model achieves only a 42.9% execution pass rate, indicating significant room for improvement. DI-BENCH establishes a new viewpoint for evaluating LLM performance on repositories, paving the way for more robust end-to-end software synthesis.

### **[A Mutual Information Perspective on Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models for Positive View Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13718v1)**
- **Authors**: Dario Serez, Marco Cristani, Alessio Del Bue, Vittorio Murino, Pietro Morerio
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents a novel framework that utilizes Mutual Information (MI) to analyze the impact of latent variables in Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs). It addresses the empirical understanding of MLVGMs by systematically quantifying the contribution of each latent variable to the generative process. Recognizing underutilized variables, the study proposes a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL) that leverages the structured latent space of MLVGMs. Additionally, a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy is introduced, allowing dynamic sample generation during SSCRL training, which enhances data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated views can match or even exceed the quality of those derived from real data, contributing significantly to generative modeling and self-supervised learning frameworks. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes several noteworthy contributions that enhance the understanding and application of MLVGMs, particularly in their intersection with self-supervised learning. The framing of mutual information as a metric for evaluating latent variables is both innovative and beneficial for guiding future research and applications of MLVGMs. By exposing underutilized variables, the authors provide a new management strategy for improving the generative capability of these models, which can have strong implications in various domains. However, while the approach is systematic and potentially influential, there are some limitations. The novelty lies in the application of MI to latent variable evaluation, but the core idea of varying latent perturbations is not entirely new to the field. Additionally, the experiments, while they demonstrate efficacy, could benefit from more extensive comparative benchmarks against other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, further detail on how the framework can be generalized across different MLVGMs would strengthen its impact. In terms of significance, this work presents a solid advance in improving MLVGMs' utility for SSCRL. The introduction of a Continuous Sampling strategy also reflects a forward-thinking approach to data generation, which is critically needed in areas facing data scarcity. However, without substantial empirical validation in a wider range of applications, the broader claim regarding the surpassing performance of synthetic views over real data should be treated with caution. Overall, given the relevant advancements and systematic approach in this paper, I would assign a score of **8**. This score reflects strong contributions tempered by some reservations about novelty and the need for further validation.  **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics and latent variable utilization remain only empirically observed. In this work, we propose a novel framework to systematically quantify the impact of each latent variable in MLVGMs, using Mutual Information (MI) as a guiding metric. Our analysis reveals underutilized variables and can guide the use of MLVGMs in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, and guided by the previous analysis, we apply tailored latent perturbations to produce diverse views for SSCRL, without relying on real data altogether. Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data. This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

### **[Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13720v1)**
- **Authors**: Anna Kruspe
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary  The paper "Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models" explores geocultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on their representation of different musical cultures. The authors argue that biases present in LLMs, like ChatGPT and Mixtral, can arise from an uneven distribution of geographic and cultural data in the training sets. The research includes two experiments: the first prompts the LLMs to list the "Top 100" musical contributors across categories while analyzing their countries of origin; the second asks LLMs to numerically rate aspects of musical cultures from various countries. Findings reveal a significant inclination towards Western musical traditions, highlighting the potential ethnocentrism ingrained in these models. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty This paper provides a relatively novel contribution by investigating the specific area of musical ethnocentrism within LLMs, a subject that has not been extensively covered in existing literature. While biases in AI and LLMs are increasingly under scrutiny, the focus on musical traditions offers a fresh perspective that is crucial for understanding cultural representation in AI outputs. #### Significance The implications of the findings are significant, as they highlight the risks of perpetuating cultural biases through AI tools, which are increasingly integrated into everyday life. By clearly demonstrating the limitations of LLMs in accurately representing global musical diversity, this research could inform developers and researchers to take a more balanced approach in training data selection. #### Strengths - The methodological approach is clear and well-structured, allowing readers to understand the specific experiments conducted. - The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about bias in AI, thus supplementing existing research. #### Weaknesses - The paper lacks a deeper exploration of the underlying reasons behind the observed biases, such as the cultural, historical, or societal factors that may contribute to the underrepresentation of non-Western musical traditions. - The scope of the study could be broadened to include qualitative analyses of how LLMs interpret and categorize musical contributions beyond numerical ratings and rankings. #### Potential Influence The paper potentially serves as a catalyst for further research into cultural biases in AI systems. By identifying and documenting this specific bias, it encourages additional scrutiny of the cultural dimensions of AI outputs and motivates a call for more representative training data. Considering the thoughtful approach and the relevance of the issue discussed, together with its strengths and areas for improvement, I assign a **score of 7**. This score reflects the paper's notable contribution to highlighting a critical issue within the field of AI research, while also acknowledging its limitations in-depth analysis and exploration of the biases identified. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.

### **[RPO: Retrieval Preference Optimization for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13726v1)**
- **Authors**: Shi-Qi Yan, Zhen-Hua Ling
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), an innovative alignment method that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models by addressing the challenges associated with the accuracy of externally retrieved contextual information. It highlights that large language models often struggle with knowledge discrepancies between retrieved and internally memorized information, which can lead to conflicts in generated responses. RPO aims to optimize the retrieval process by integrating an implicit representation of retrieval relevance within the reward model, allowing the model to evaluate retrieval quality during response generation seamlessly. The experimental results suggest that RPO improves model accuracy by 4-10% over traditional RAG methods without necessitating additional components, indicating broader applicability and robust generalization capabilities across four datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of RPO lies in its approach to unify retrieval evaluation and response generation within a single framework, a step that is notably lacking in existing methodologies. By addressing the retrieval relevance directly and including it in the training process, RPO attempts to bridge a critical gap which is essential for improving the reliability of outcomes in knowledge-based systems. Additionally, RPO's ability to quantify retrieval awareness during training provides a distinctive edge by resolving existing mathematical complexities. However, the paper could strengthen its impact by addressing the scalability implications of RPO, particularly how it performs under varying retrieval conditions or in diverse domains. Moreover, while the results are promising, a more detailed analysis comparing the performance of RPO across various model architectures and retrieval strategies would substantiate its general applicability and robustness. Despite these concerns, RPO presents a significant advancement in the area of retrieval-augmented generative models, successfully introducing and proving its methodology through rigorous experimentation. The potential ramifications of RPO in mitigating knowledge conflicts in generation tasks could spur additional research and developersâ interest in creating more adaptable and efficient models. Overall, the contributions of this work to enhancing the effectiveness of retrieval mechanisms in language generation warrants a high score. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has exhibited promise in utilizing external knowledge, its generation process heavily depends on the quality and accuracy of the retrieved context. Large language models (LLMs) struggle to evaluate the correctness of non-parametric knowledge retrieved externally when it differs from internal memorization, leading to knowledge conflicts during response generation. To this end, we introduce the Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is the only RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of retrieval relevance in training, overcoming mathematical obstacles. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that RPO outperforms RAG by 4-10% in accuracy without any extra component, exhibiting its robust generalization.

### **[Pseudocode-Injection Magic: Enabling LLMs to Tackle Graph Computational Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13731v1)**
- **Authors**: Chang Gong, Wanrui Bian, Zhijie Zhang, Weiguo Zheng
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces a novel framework named PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks) to enhance the ability of large language models (LLMs) in solving graph-related computational tasks. Traditional approaches face limitations due to LLMs' difficulties in understanding complex graph structures and high inference costs. PIE consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation, where LLMs generate code based on problem extraction, while the interpreter analyzes graph structures and executes the generated code. The innovation lies in injecting task-related pseudocode into the prompts, which aids LLMs in producing effective solutions without requiring repeated LLM calls for individual test cases, thereby lowering computational costs. Empirical results indicate that PIE demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing benchmarks. ### Critical Evaluation  The novelty of the paper lies primarily in its innovative framework that combines pseudocode injection with LLM capabilities specifically for graph computational tasks. By minimizing the reliance on real-time LLM calls and instead allowing the generated code to be reused, PIE addresses a significant barrier to the practical application of LLMs, making the approach both cost-effective and more scalable. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The pseudocode injection technique is a fresh contribution that allows LLMs to leverage structured programming logic effectively. 2. **Efficiency Gains**: The reduction in inference costs and improved efficiency in execution represents a practical advancement for deploying LLMs in complex computational tasks. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating the utility of PIE against established baselines, which bolsters the claims made by the authors. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the framework shows promising results, the paper may benefit from a broader range of graph types or complexities in its experimental evaluation. 2. **Generalizability Concerns**: The reliance on LLMs may still pose challenges in different domains of graph tasks, especially those requiring fine-tuned domain knowledge or multimodal data. 3. **Potential Overfitting**: The significant focus on reducing inference costs could lead to a trade-off concerning the adaptability of generated solutions in various real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper makes a commendable contribution to the understanding of LLM applications in graph theory, particularly in enhancing performance and cost-effectiveness. However, the generalizability of the approach and broader applications need further exploration. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the challenges and potential of retrieval-augmented code generation, which aims to automatically convert natural language descriptions into code snippets. While advancements in deep learning have propelled code generation quality, a notable obstacle is the semantic gap between natural language and source code. To mitigate this gap, prior research has often implemented a retrieval-augmented framework, where similar code snippets retrieved in response to a natural language query assist in generating the desired code. This study evaluates three leading pre-trained models: CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5. Results indicate that integrating a retrieval-augmented approach improves the models' performance. The authors recommend specific methods for retrieval integration, such as BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion, while also introducing the need for Sketch Filling Fusion. Additionally, they analyze the impact of retrieval-augmented approaches on large language models, highlighting a balance between enhanced performance and computational costs. **Evaluation:** The study offers several significant contributions to the field of code generation. First, it provides a much-needed systematic evaluation of the retrieval-augmented framework, addressing a gap in the current literature. Previous studies frequently discussed individual components but failed to offer a cohesive view of the framework's applicability and results, making this paper a critical resource for researchers and practitioners alike. The investigation of specific retrieval methods further enriches the discourse. By recommending BM25, Sequential Integration Fusion, and Sketch Filling Fusion, the authors provide practical insights that could influence future implementations of code generation tools, thereby benefitting both academia and industry. The paperâs empirical experiments reinforce these recommendations and facilitate a deeper understanding of how retrieval-augmented networks can improve coding models. However, the study could have presented a deeper analysis of the limitations inherent in retrieval-based approaches, such as potential biases in the retrieved code or the quality of the natural language requirements. Additionally, while the discussion on the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs is useful, it could benefit from quantitative metrics to underscore these claims. Overall, the paper's novelty lies in its focused approach to evaluating and enhancing existing models through retrieval integration. Given its systematic analysis, practical contributions, and potential to impact future research, I would rate this paper favorably. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's contribution to understanding and optimizing retrieval-augmented code generation, while acknowledging areas that could benefit from further exploration.
- **Abstract**: Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces UGMathBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) at the undergraduate level. Existing benchmarks are criticized for inadequate coverage and potential contamination issues, which UGMathBench addresses by offering 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, including ten types of answers. Each problem has three randomized versions, with more to come as LLMs evolve. The authors introduce two metrics for evaluation: effective accuracy (EAcc) and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which aim to capture the performance and reasoning robustness of LLMs. Evaluations show that the best EAcc achieved by models is 56.3%, indicating room for improvement in mathematical reasoning for LLMs. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of the UGMathBench as a resource for future research in this area. **Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies primarily in the development of the UGMathBench benchmark, which seeks to fill a gap in evaluating LLMs specifically on undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning. This is significant because previous benchmarks may not adequately represent the breadth and complexity of the required reasoning skills. By including a large and diverse set of problems with randomized versions, the authors aim to enhance the robustness of evaluations, addressing issues like test-set contamination. However, there are some noteworthy weaknesses. First, while the creation of UGMathBench is valuable, the impact of the benchmark may depend on its adoption by the research community and whether it leads to substantial improvements in LLM performance. Second, the paper does not sufficiently explore specific limitations of current LLMs in the context of mathematical reasoning beyond the metrics introduced. Moreover, while the proposed metrics are fine, their practical application in guiding model enhancements is not deeply discussed. The findings presented in the paper reveal a clear need for improvement in LLMs, but the overall success of UGMathBench as a tool will depend on ongoing engagement with it by researchers and developers. Overall, the contribution of UGMathBench is a positive step toward addressing the evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, though its long-term impact will require further validation and community engagement. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with notable novelty, balanced by a cautious perspective regarding its impact due to the mentioned limitations. While the benchmark is a timely and useful addition, its effectiveness in driving substantial advancements in mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs remains to be seen.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.

- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents DEITSP, an innovative approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a diffusion-based non-autoregressive (NAR) method. Acknowledging the common trade-off in non-autoregressive models between speed and solution quality, the authors introduce several key enhancements. Firstly, they employ a one-step diffusion model that enhances solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions while integrating controlled noisy processes. Secondly, a dual-modality graph transformer is introduced to effectively combine features from nodes and edges while speeding up inference with fewer transformation layers. Thirdly, an iterative strategy that alternates noise addition and removal is developed to enhance exploration. A scheduling framework is also proposed to refine the solution space progressively. Extensive experiments show that DEITSP outperforms existing neural methods in terms of solution quality, inference speed, and generalization. ### Critical Evaluation The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its hybrid approach that combines diffusion models with non-autoregressive methodologies specifically tailored for the TSPâan area known for its computational complexity. The integration of one-step diffusion with self-consistency and a dual-modality transformer represents an innovative way to leverage the strengths of various modeling approaches to improve the exploration of potential solutions. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of diffusion processes within NAR frameworks represents a compelling synthesis that could inspire further research in both fields. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The extensive experiments demonstrated not just improvements in performance metrics but targeted enhancements in practical applications, signaling the model's readiness for real-world usage. 3. **Open Source:** The availability of the implementation fosters reproducibility and allows further exploration by other researchers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed methods, particularly the dual-modality graph transformer and iterative noise adjustment, may be difficult to implement and tune in practice, limiting accessibility for practitioners. 2. **Comparative Baselines:** While the results are promising, the comparison with existing methods may lack depth, as not all state-of-the-art models may have been included, which is crucial to convincingly position DEITSP within the landscape of TSP solvers. 3. **Generalization Claims:** Although claims about generalization ability are made, the experiments may not fully address various edge cases commonly encountered in TSPs that reflect a real-world scenario. ### Score Justification Taking into account the novel contributions, the potential for significant impact on TSP research, and the paperâs experimental rigors while also recognizing its complexities and some weaknesses in comparative depth, I assign a score of **8**. This reflects a solid contribution to the field that may not be groundbreaking in a historic sense but stands to meaningfully advance methodologies for TSP and related optimization challenges. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted engineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability.

This opens a new research avenue essential for ensuring the responsible use of multimodal AI technologies. 2. **Practical Tools:** The introduction of the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET) and Edited Audio Datasets (EADs) represents significant contributions that can be widely used for further research and evaluation by other scholars in the field. They effectively lay the foundation for exploring exploitation techniques associated with LALMs. 3. **Relevance:** With the increasing prevalence of multimodal AI applications, understanding audio interactions and security implications is timely and relevant, catering to concerns in AI safety and ethical implications of deployment. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper provides a groundwork for exploring audio edits, the depth and breadth of the experimental results could be enhanced. More extensive testing across varied LALMs and comprehensive scenarios would provide stronger evidence of the robustness and generality of the findings. 2. **Comparative Framework:** The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparative analysis between LALMs and other types of models, especially highlighting how audio interacts with other modalities. This would contextualize the findings more effectively within the broader field of multimodal research. 3. **Potential Overlooked Concerns:** The paper primarily focuses on the audio modality, which while necessary, may overlook interactions that could arise when combining edits across different modalities, thus limiting insights into comprehensive security vulnerabilities. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents a novel exploration into audio-specific vulnerabilities in LALMs with practical tools and a relevant research agenda. While there are areas for improvement in terms of experimental rigor and comparative analysis, the initial findings are impactful and pave the way for future investigations into security challenges in the evolving field of AI. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.

### **[Do Large Language Models Truly Understand Geometric Structures?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13773v1)**
- **Authors**: Xiaofeng Wang, Yiming Wang, Wenhong Zhu, Rui Wang
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper investigates the geometric abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting a critical gap in the assessment methodologies used to evaluate these models. Traditional testing primarily focuses on final outputs, which may mask the models' actual understanding of geometric relationships, as they can achieve correct results by chance. To address this shortcoming, the authors introduce the GeomRel dataset, specifically designed to assess LLMs based on their ability to identify geometric relationships rather than just arriving at a correct answer. Through evaluations using this dataset, the authors identify significant limitations in the current understanding of geometric structures among various LLMs. In response to these findings, they propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which aims to improve LLMs' capabilities in recognizing geometric relationships, leading to notable enhancements in performance. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Dataset**: The introduction of the GeomRel dataset fills a critical gap in benchmarking LLMs' understanding of geometry, providing a more focused criterion for evaluation beyond mere answer accuracy. 2. **Addressing Challenges in LLMs**: The paper tackles the often-overlooked challenge of spatial comprehension in LLMs, which is increasingly relevant as these models are applied in more complex domains. 3. **New Methodology**: The proposal of the GeoCoT method represents a valuable step towards improving LLMsâ geometric reasoning capabilities, indicating potential for advancement in future model training approaches. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the focus on geometric relationships is insightful, the findings may be limited to this domain, potentially lacking broader implications for other areas of reasoning in LLMs. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: The evaluation of existing LLMs may not go deep enough into exploring why these models fail at understanding geometric relationships, leaving questions about underlying causes unanswered. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The GeoCoT method could increase the complexity of model training, and the scalability of these improvements across various LLM architectures is not fully addressed. **Potential Influence**: This paper can stimulate further research into not only geometric comprehension in LLMs but also the development of evaluation metrics that assess understanding across various domains. It can encourage future studies to expand this research into more abstract reasoning areas. Overall, considering the innovative contributions of the dataset and the proposed methodology, alongside the need for deeper explorations of the limitations identified, I assign a score that reflects both the promise and the areas that require further development. **Score: 8**  ### Rationale The score of 8 signifies a substantial contribution to the field, recognizing the paper's novelty and its potential to influence future research directions while also acknowledging certain weaknesses. The creation of a targeted dataset and an innovative method are commendable, yet there are aspects that future work must address for a more holistic understanding of LLMsâ capabilities in geometric reasoning and beyond.
- **Abstract**: Geometric ability is a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for advanced spatial comprehension and abstract thinking. Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.

### **[Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13779v1)**
- **Authors**: Tanya Rodchenko, Natasha Noy, Nino Scherrer, Jennifer Prendki
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper argues that while the current trend in training Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the accumulation of larger datasets, there is a need for a more intentional approach to data acquisition. It suggests that not all tasks in AI will benefit equally from increased data and that understanding the topology of data can guide researchers in identifying which tasks are worth focusing on for data scaling. The authors posit that this understanding should also inform the evolution of computational paradigms to address scenarios where simply increasing data may be insufficient or inefficient. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant re-evaluation of the prevailing notion that "more data is always better" in the development of AI, specifically LLMs. This perspective is particularly relevant given the escalating costs and resources associated with data collection and model training. The novelty lies in the emphasis on the qualitative aspects of data and task suitability, rather than sheer quantityâa viewpoint that has been underexplored in mainstream discussions.  Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Timeliness:** As models grow larger, the community increasingly faces challenges related to data acquisition, ethical concerns, and resource allocation. 2. **Conceptual Framework:** Providing a framework where task topology is considered allows for a structured approach to data selection, potentially leading to more efficient model performance. 3. **Call for Intentionality:** The push for intentional data scaling practices is important, advocating for research rigor and ethical considerations. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Abstractness:** The framework proposed may lack concrete methodologies for practitioners to apply, making it difficult to translate the theory into actionable steps. 2. **Generalizability:** The argument, while compelling, may not be universally applicable across all AI domains, and specific validation through case studies or empirical data is lacking. 3. **Underexplored Considerations:** While topology is emphasized, the paper does not sufficiently address other complications, such as data quality issues or biases, that interplay with data scaling. Overall, the paper proposes a well-founded shift in perspective that could inspire more nuanced approaches to AI development. However, its impact is somewhat tempered by the lack of practical guidelines and empirical backing. Therefore, while the paper does provide a notable contribution to the field, its realization in practice may need further elaboration. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the topology of data itself informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.

### **[Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting mobile traffic from cellular base stations, which is vital for enhancing network performance amid the unpredictable nature of traffic influenced by human behavior and environmental factors. While diffusion models are effective in capturing temporal dynamics, existing methodologies often overlook the significance of noise in the denoising process. This paper introduces NPDiff, a novel framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, where the prior reflects data dynamics. By harnessing this innovative perspective, NPDiff enhances the model's capability to accommodate both regular and sudden traffic fluctuations. The methodology is shown to integrate well with various diffusion-based models and has been tested with extensive experiments, achieving over a 30% improvement in prediction performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper brings forth a crucial and underexplored aspect of diffusion modelsânoise in the denoising process, which is especially relevant in the context of mobile traffic prediction. This departure from the conventional focus on model architecture and instead honing in on the significance of noise showcases an innovative perspective that could prompt further research into similar approaches across various domains. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The focus on the role of noise as a predictive factor is innovative and adds a significant layer to current methodologies in mobile traffic prediction. 2. **Practical Implications**: The proposed framework could have wide-ranging ramifications for improving network operations in urban settings, which is timely given the increasing reliance on mobile communication. 3. **Performance Improvement**: The reported 30% enhancement in prediction accuracy indicates strong empirical validation, suggesting that the framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality**: While the paper claims that NPDiff can integrate with various diffusion models, further clarification on the boundaries of its applicability is necessary. 2. **Complexity**: The introduction of noise decomposition may add complexity to the modeling process, raising questions about the trade-off between interpretability and improved performance. 3. **Scalability**: The experiments should detail how well the framework scales with increasing data size or network growth, as practical implementation requires robustness in diverse environments. Taking all of this into consideration, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of mobile traffic prediction using diffusion models. The innovative emphasis on noise priors is particularly timely and necessary, potentially influencing future research directions. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.

- **Authors**: Abhishek Tandon, Geetanjali Sharma, Gaurav Jaswal, Aditya Nigam, Raghavendra Ramachandra
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel image generation technique for forehead creases utilized in user verification tasks. It employs geometrical modeling through B-spline and BÃ©zier curves to create realistic images of both prominent and subtle forehead creases. These images are then used as prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image model to generate mated samples, enhancing a synthetic dataset for training a forehead-crease verification network. To improve diversity among the synthetic samples, the authors introduce two strategies: perturbing control points of B-splines while maintaining label consistency, and employing tailored image-level augmentations. The integration of this synthetic dataset with real-world data yields improved performance in forehead-crease verification, demonstrated through a cross-database protocol. **Evaluation:** The paper exhibits clear novel contributions to the domain of biometric verification, particularly by addressing the generation of a trait-specific element, forehead creases. The geometric modeling approach using hierarchical curves (B-splines and BÃ©zier) is particularly innovative, positioning it as a significant departure from common generative adversarial networks (GANs) typically used in synthetic data generation. This method specifically caters to enhancing the realism of the images, which is crucial for the verification task. The methods employed to introduce diversity in generated samples are well-conceived, addressing potential pitfalls of overfitting to specific patterns in the training data. By ensuring that the synthetic images retain label consistency while being diverse, the authors take a critical step towards enhancing the robustness of their verification methodology. However, the implications of this work raise some concerns. The performance improvements in real applications and across diverse datasets, while promising, may benefit from comprehensive evaluations that detail the robustness of the system against various adversarial attacks or differences in user populations. The applicability of this method in broader biometric systems or its ability to scale with increasing diversity remains to be established. Overall, the novelty of the proposed approach and its specific applicability to forehead-crease verification present a meaningful contribution to biometric technologies. However, the limitations regarding broader applicability and potential need for robustness against real-world variations temper the impact somewhat. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the strong innovative framework the authors provide and significant advances in synthetic identity training for biometric systems, while acknowledging the challenges in validating their performance under more generalized conditions.
- **Abstract**: We propose a trait-specific image generation method that models forehead creases geometrically using B-spline and B\'ezier curves. This approach ensures the realistic generation of both principal creases and non-prominent crease patterns, effectively constructing detailed and authentic forehead-crease images. These geometrically rendered images serve as visual prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image translation model, which generates corresponding mated samples. The resulting novel synthetic identities are then used to train a forehead-crease verification network. To enhance intra-subject diversity in the generated samples, we employ two strategies: (a) perturbing the control points of B-splines under defined constraints to maintain label consistency, and (b) applying image-level augmentations to the geometric visual prompts, such as dropout and elastic transformations, specifically tailored to crease patterns. By integrating the proposed synthetic dataset with real-world data, our method significantly improves the performance of forehead-crease verification systems under a cross-database verification protocol.

It successfully demonstrates substantial improvements in performance, which is highly relevant at this juncture in research. However, the need for broader applicability studies and clearer result representation prevents a higher score. Overall, the paper is well-positioned to inspire further research and innovation in image generation technologies.
- **Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.

### **[INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14014v1)**
- **Authors**: Di You, Pier Luigi Dragotti
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration" focuses on addressing limitations in existing image restoration (IR) methods that utilize generative diffusion models. These methods often require specific knowledge of degradation models, which can limit their applicability to real-world scenarios. The authors propose two algorithms, INDIGO for non-blind restoration and BlindINDIGO for blind restoration, which integrate Invertible Neural Networks (INN) with pre-trained diffusion models to create a flexible framework for handling a variety of degradation processes. The approach involves training the forward process of the INN to replicate any degradation, while the inverse is used to enhance the reverse diffusion sampling. An initialization strategy is also introduced to boost performance and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that INDIGO+ competes well with leading methods in both quantitative and visual assessments on synthetic and real-world images. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The contribution of the paper is notable as it addresses a significant gap in image restoration techniques, particularly in enhancing the flexibility of both blind and non-blind approaches. By combining INN's reconstruction capabilities with diffusion models' generative power, the authors introduce a dual approach that does not rely on predefined degradation models. This combination represents a step forward in the field, allowing more diverse applications of image restoration. **Strengths:**  1. **Innovative Integration:** The merging of INN and diffusion models is an inventive solution to the problems outlined. It harnesses the strengths of both approaches, improving restoration flexibility. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results demonstrating that INDIGO+ performs competitively against existing state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its practical applicability. 3. **Versatility:** This method is positioned to handle a wide range of degradation processes, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** The proposed methodology inherently involves additional complexity because it integrates multiple advanced technologies (INN and diffusion). The need for careful tuning and understanding of both methods may present challenges for practitioners. 2. **Performance Margins:** While results are competitive, the paper does not clearly detail in what specific scenarios the new approaches notably outperform existing methods, which could limit the perceived impact of the work. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The reliance on pre-trained models may raise questions about scalability for various applications and whether the approach can maintain performance across different types of datasets beyond those tested. **Potential Influence:** The introduction of the INDIGO and BlindINDIGO algorithms is likely to influence future research in image restoration, particularly in developing flexible, generative methods that can adapt to diverse real-world degradation scenarios. Their innovative approach may inspire further explorations in combining different model types to enhance restoration technology. **Score Justification:** Given its novel approach to a pressing issue in image restoration, solid experimental backing, and focus on real-world applicability, the paper merits a relatively high score. However, the complexities involved and the need for broader application validation temper its impact slightly. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in image restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate realistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.

- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates substance use among adolescents by analyzing social media posts using Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies emotional and contextual drivers that influence substance use-related discussions. Key findings reveal that negative emotions, particularly sadness and guilt, are prevalent in posts about substance use, while joy is more common in non-substance use contexts. The study emphasizes that guilt may act as a protective factor against substance use, whereas shame and peer influence increase risk.

- **Abstract**: Adolescence is a critical stage often linked to risky behaviors, including substance use, with significant developmental and public health implications. Social media provides a lens into adolescent self-expression, but interpreting emotional and contextual signals remains complex. This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze adolescents' social media posts, uncovering emotional patterns (e.g., sadness, guilt, fear, joy) and contextual factors (e.g., family, peers, school) related to substance use. Heatmap and machine learning analyses identified key predictors of substance use-related posts. Negative emotions like sadness and guilt were significantly more frequent in substance use contexts, with guilt acting as a protective factor, while shame and peer influence heightened substance use risk. Joy was more common in non-substance use discussions. Peer influence correlated strongly with sadness, fear, and disgust, while family and school environments aligned with non-substance use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional vulnerabilities and contextual influences, suggesting that collaborative interventions involving families, schools, and communities can reduce risk factors and foster healthier adolescent development.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to malicious prompts disguised in scientific language. Through experiments involving various models (including GPT-4 and Llama3), the authors demonstrate that these models exhibit increased biases and toxicity when misinterpretations of social science data are presented as legitimate evidence. Notably, such prompts can lead to the generation of false scientific arguments that suggest biases are advantageous, posing risks for misuse by malicious actors. The authors emphasize the influence of citation practices and ongoing dialogue on bias scores, urging for improved scrutiny in the use of scientific data during LLM training. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This work is significant and timely as it addresses a growing concern within the AI community regarding the ethical implications and safety of deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios. The exploration of how scientific language can be manipulated to exploit biases in these models highlights an under-researched vulnerability, making the findings noteworthy. Moreover, the paper's focus on the specific mechanisms by which prompts can alter model outputs advances our understanding of LLM behaviors, which is crucial for improving model safety. However, while the identified issue is critical, the methodology could be regarded as somewhat limited in scope, focusing mainly on specific models without a comprehensive exploration of diverse LLM architectures or their training datasets. This could raise questions about the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the empirical demonstration is largely correlational and may require further validation to establish causative relationships. Despite these weaknesses, the paper successfully underscores the potential implications for safety and ethics in AI, making a compelling case for revisiting how LLMs are trained and deployed. Addressing the vulnerabilities highlighted in this paper could lead to improvements in model design and robustness, enhancing the safety of future AI applications. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's meaningful contribution to understanding the vulnerabilities of LLMs, while acknowledging its limitations in methodological breadth and the need for further validation of its findings. The work serves as a valuable foundation for future research aimed at enhancing AI safety, thereby exerting influence in the field.
- **Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) have been deployed in various real-world settings, concerns about the harm they may propagate have grown. Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data in the training of LLMs.

- **Abstract**: Biological relation networks contain rich information for understanding the biological mechanisms behind the relationship of entities such as genes, proteins, diseases, and chemicals. The vast growth of biomedical literature poses significant challenges updating the network knowledge. The recent Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED) provides valuable manual annotations, facilitating the develop-ment of machine-learning and pre-trained language model approaches for automatically identifying novel document-level (inter-sentence context) relationships. Nonetheless, its annotations lack directionality (subject/object) for the entity roles, essential for studying complex biological networks. Herein we annotate the entity roles of the relationships in the BioRED corpus and subsequently propose a novel multi-task language model with soft-prompt learning to jointly identify the relationship, novel findings, and entity roles. Our results in-clude an enriched BioRED corpus with 10,864 directionality annotations. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms existing large language models such as the state-of-the-art GPT-4 and Llama-3 on two benchmarking tasks.

- **Abstract**: With the rapid expansion of large language model (LLM) applications, there is an emerging shift in the role of LLM-based AI chatbots from serving merely as general inquiry tools to acting as professional service agents. However, current studies often overlook a critical aspect of professional service agents: the act of communicating in a manner consistent with their professional identities. This is of particular importance in the healthcare sector, where effective communication with patients is essential for achieving professional goals, such as promoting patient well-being by encouraging healthy behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional Identity), a novel framework for designing professional service agent tailored for medical question-and-answer (Q\&A) services, ensuring alignment with a specific professional identity. Our method includes a theory-guided task planning process that decomposes complex professional tasks into manageable subtasks aligned with professional objectives and a pragmatic entropy method designed to generate professional and ethical responses with low uncertainty. Experiments on various LLMs show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, across key metrics such as fluency, naturalness, empathy, patient-centricity, and ROUGE-L scores. Additionally, the ablation study underscores the contribution of each component to the overall effectiveness of the approach.

The authors propose a range of agent archetypes for dealing with VL-DCOPs, ranging from neuro-symbolic agents that combine algorithmic decision-making with LFMs, to fully neural agents that rely entirely on LFMs for coordination tasks. The evaluation employs state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) across three unique VL-DCOP tasks, examining the strengths and limitations of each agent archetype. The paper concludes by addressing the implications of this framework for addressing larger, unresolved challenges within the DCOP domain. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper introduces a promising framework, VL-DCOPs, that directs attention toward leveraging LFMs in automating DCOP solutions.

The concept of agent archetypes allows for a nuanced understanding of the various ways LFMs can be utilized within these frameworks. **Significance**: The significance lies in the automation of a traditionally manual process, thus displaying a potential efficiency gain in multi-agent coordination. By evaluating various archetypes, the study paves the way for understanding the trade-offs between reliance on LFM capabilities and control remaining with algorithmic processes. This makes it relevant not only for researchers in the field of AI and multi-agent systems but also for applications where coordination among distributed agents is critical. **Strengths**: 1.

The use of multimodal foundation models (LFMs) could lead to substantial advancements in both theory and application. 3. The empirical evaluation across diverse tasks showcases practical implications and provides insight into the operational capabilities of different agent types. **Weaknesses**: 1. The architectural complexity of fully neural agents may introduce challenges in interpretability and debugging, which is crucial when applying AI systems in real-world situations. 2. There may be limitations concerning the scalability of the approach, as the task complexity may grow faster than the capabilities of the LFMs in real-time contexts. 3. The paper might not sufficiently address how the framework can handle edge cases or scenarios where visual and linguistic information conflict. Overall, the paper contributes significantly to the field of multi-agent coordination by bridging traditional optimization problems with modern AI approaches. However, it will need to address some underlying limitations and potential challenges associated with deploying these multimodal foundation models effectively. **Score: 8**.
- **Abstract**: Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) offer a powerful framework for multi-agent coordination but often rely on labor-intensive, manual problem construction. To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.

### **[VideoShield: Regulating Diffusion-based Video Generation Models via Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14195v1)**
- **Authors**: Runyi Hu, Jie Zhang, Yiming Li, Jiwei Li, Qing Guo, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "VideoShield: Regulating Diffusion-based Video Generation Models via Watermarking" discusses a novel watermarking framework aimed at enhancing content control in AI-generated videos. As video generation technology, such as text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, advances, ensuring the integrity of generated content becomes increasingly important. While traditional watermarking techniques have focused primarily on images, they often compromise video quality by embedding watermarks frame-by-frame after generation. VideoShield proposes an innovative solution that integrates watermark embedding directly into the video generation process, thus avoiding additional training. The framework includes features for tamper localization, allowing it to detect modifications across time and space within videos. Utilizing DDIM Inversion, the method enables easy extraction of watermarks while maintaining the original video quality. The findings suggest the method is effective in both video and image generation contexts, demonstrating strong performance in watermark extraction and tamper detection. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty (Positive Aspects):** 1. **Focus on Video Generation Models:** This paper addresses a significant gap in research concerning watermarking techniques specific to videos, contrasting with a body of work primarily concentrated on images. 2. **Integration of Watermarking in Generation Process:** By embedding watermarks directly during the video generation process, VideoShield overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that function as post-processing techniques, presenting a more holistic approach to watermarking.  3. **Tamper Localization Feature:** The inclusion of a feature that detects both temporal and spatial alterations adds a layer of sophistication to traditional watermarking techniques, enhancing the robustness of the method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis against existing watermarking techniques. A detailed discussion could reinforce the advantages of using VideoShield over traditional methods. 2. **Generality and Scalability:** While the framework is demonstrated with various video models, it would be informative to clarify if the approach scales effectively to all types of diffusion-based models and whether specific parameters could limit its applicability. 3. **Long-term Viability:** The proposed method's performance against more advanced adversarial techniques in watermark removal or video tampering remains to be extensively examined. **Significance:** VideoShield holds promise in improving the security and integrity of AIGC in video content. The implications for copyright protection and authenticity verification in the vast field of generative AI technology are significant, particularly as these technologies proliferate in media and entertainment sectors. The innovative nature of the integrated watermarking process directly during generation marks a potential shift in how AIGC can be securely managed. Overall, while the paper makes notable contributions to an emerging area of research, the potential limitations and lack of extensive comparative insights slightly diminish its impact.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's clear contribution to video watermarking, addressing existing gaps in research, while emphasizing the need for further validation against competitive techniques and the long-term effectiveness of the proposed framework.
- **Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has advanced significantly, particularly with the development of video generation models such as text-to-video (T2V) models and image-to-video (I2V) models. However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well.

- **Authors**: Minrui Xu, Dusit Niyato, Christopher G. Brinton
- **Classification**: cs.NI

The innovation of applying test-time deep reinforcement learning to optimize model caching and inference offloading represents a novel approach in this domain, particularly in the context of continuous model use and interaction.  Strengths: 1. **Novelty**: The framework utilizes the emerging concept of T2DRL, which is a relevant advancement in real-time model optimization. 2. **Practical Application**: Focus on edge computing aligns with current technological trends where mobile and resource-constrained environments are predominant. 3. **Performance Metrics**: The paper provides quantitative metrics demonstrating cost reductions, which is vital for evaluation. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper addresses long-context LLMs, it does not explore potential trade-offs with models that may not require such extensive contexts. 2. **Generalizability of Results**: The experimental setup may not adequately represent diverse real-world scenarios, which could limit the applicability of findings. 3. **Complexity**: The proposed mechanisms, particularly the DDA, might introduce additional overheads that need further investigation in practical implementations outside of the tested environments. Overall, the paper represents a noteworthy development in the growing field of efficient LLM deployment at the edge. It effectively tackles a relevant issue and could inspire future research in this area, particularly in optimizing resource use in real-world applications. Nonetheless, empirical validation in various contexts and simplifying complexity for practical deployment remain areas to explore further. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to optimizing LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments while acknowledging areas needing further investigation and validation.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.

- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces TFG-Flow, a novel approach for training-free guidance in multimodal generative models, particularly in the context of generative flow. While existing training-free guidance techniques primarily focus on continuous data, TFG-Flow uniquely addresses the challenges associated with multimodality, which includes both continuous and discrete variables. The method boasts the ability to mitigate issues related to the curse-of-dimensionality while ensuring unbiased sampling for discrete variables. The authors validate TFG-Flow through experiments on four molecular design tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating drug-like molecules with targeted properties. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:**  TFG-Flow represents a significant advancement in the realm of training-free guidance in generative models, particularly as it addresses the gap in handling multimodal data types. The approach not only builds on the established framework of flow matching but also introduces techniques that cater to both continuous and discrete data, which is crucial in scientific applications, notably in drug design. This dual focus on unbiased sampling and flexibility in generating diverse outcomes showcases a commendable level of innovation. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Gap in the Field:** The approach fills a critical void in current methodologies, as most existing training-free guidance methods are limited to continuous spaces. By extending these techniques to multimodal contexts, TFG-Flow opens doors for broader applications in diverse domains. 2. **Practical Relevance:** The validation of TFG-Flow on molecular design tasks indicates its practical implications in important real-world situations, such as drug discovery, making it significantly relevant to both academia and industry. 3. **Efficiency in Guiding Generative Models:** The ability to guide generative models without additional training enhances the ease of application, which is vital for researchers and practitioners who require swift outcomes. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Experimental Scope:** While the paper showcases applicability in four molecular tasks, a broader range of applications or a detailed comparison against existing multimodal methods could strengthen the argument for the approach's generalizability and robustness. 2. **Absence of Theoretical Foundations:** While the practical merits are highlighted, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of why TFG-Flow effectively overcomes the curse-of-dimensionality in multimodal spaces could enhance the academic rigor of the paper. **Overall Impact:** The introduction of TFG-Flow can potentially shift the landscape of generative modeling in areas that require multimodal data analysis. The implications for drug design are particularly noteworthy, suggesting that this method could enhance the efficiency and efficacy of generating novel compounds with desired traits. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's innovative approach to a pertinent problem within generative modeling, a well-defined contribution to the field, and its undeniable practical applications. However, the limitations in experimental breadth and the need for stronger theoretical backing prevent it from reaching a perfect score. The work is certainly a notable advancement, meriting recognition in the landscape of generative methodologies.
- **Abstract**: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.

- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Top Ten Challenges Towards Agentic Neural Graph Databases" addresses the limitations of traditional graph databases (GDBs) and neural graph databases (NGDBs). While conventional GDBs, such as Neo4j and TigerGraph, perform well with interconnected data, they fall short in advanced inference capabilities. NGDBs attempt to fill this gap by utilizing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance reasoning and predictive analytics, particularly with incomplete or noisy data. However, NGDBs face challenges regarding autonomy and adaptability due to their reliance on predefined queries. To solve these issues, the authors propose Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which introduce three primary functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. The paper identifies ten critical challenges in achieving these goals, including effective semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and the integration of large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, the authors argue that Agentic NGDBs could facilitate intelligent and self-improving systems, ultimately transforming data management in dynamic applications. ### Evaluation #### Novelty The concept of Agentic NGDBs presents a novel approach to enhancing the capabilities of NGDBs by introducing an autonomy layer. While the integration of GNNs with database management is a known area of interest, the emphasis on autonomy and the identification of specific challenges reflect a fresh perspective. Moreover, the combination of continuous learning in database management is indeed innovative, pushing the boundaries of current GDB capabilities. #### Significance The proposed enhancements have the potential to significantly influence the fields of database management and machine learning by addressing practical constraints. By integrating reasoning capabilities and adaptability into graph databases, the work responds to modern data demands, where the richness of interlinked information is vital and often faced with issues like data incompleteness and noise. #### Strengths 1. **Identification of Challenges**: The paper does an excellent job of laying out specific challenges that need to be addressed for the successful realization of Agentic NGDBs. This can guide future research directions. 2. **Relevance and Applicability**: Given the surge in connected data applications, the proposed system's adaptive capabilities serve as a timely contribution to the field, promising to evolve with user needs. 3. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: The leveraging of GNNs and LLMs opens up interdisciplinary horizons, fostering collaborations between AI and database research. #### Weaknesses 1. **Lack of Technical Depth**: While challenges are identified, the paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration or preliminary solutions to these challenges, lacking technical depth in proposed methodologies. 2. **Generalizability**: The framework's general applicability across different domains isn't sufficiently examined in the paper. Its effectiveness may vary across different types of data and applications. 3. **Empirical Validation**: Without empirical evidence or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Agentic NGDBs, claims made in the paper remain somewhat speculative. Overall, while the paper presents innovative ideas and addresses significant gaps in current database technology, the execution could benefit from deeper technical insights and empirical backing. ### Score: 7 The score of 7 reflects the paper's good novelty and potential to impact the field, tempered by its shortcomings in technical exploration and empirical validation. The contribution is valuable, especially in steering future research towards making databases more autonomous and intelligent, but the paper could have greatly increased its impact with stronger methodological support and practical examples.

### **[Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14250v1)**
- **Authors**: Yi Zhao, Youzhi Zhang
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors" addresses the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications, focusing on the shortfall of current research which mainly emphasizes single-turn attacks. It posits that real-world adversaries engage in multi-turn attack strategies that manipulate LLMs through dynamic interactions rather than static patterns. Siren, the proposed framework, operates in three stages: (1) constructing a training set that utilizes feedback from Turn-Level LLMs, (2) utilizing supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization for post-training attackers, and (3) facilitating interactive engagements between attacking and target LLMs. Experimental results show a high attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B against Gemini-1.5-Pro and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, outperforming single-turn methods. The framework offers promising approaches by requiring fewer turns and incorporating strategies that align more closely with the objectives of jailbreak attacks, thus showing potential for future developments in defensive measures. ### Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper makes a notable contribution by shifting focus from single-turn attacks, which have dominated prior research, to a more realistic framework of multi-turn interactions. The ability to simulate human-like behaviors in LLM jailbreak scenarios through a learning-based method presents an innovative approach. #### Significance: The implications of Siren are profound. Given the widespread use of LLMs across various applications, understanding and developing frameworks to test their vulnerabilities is crucial. By demonstrating effective multi-turn strategies, Siren not only highlights vulnerabilities but also sets the groundwork for improving defensive tactics against them. #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The learning-based approach for simulating multi-turn attacks addresses a significant gap in existing research. 2. **High Success Rates**: The reported success rates of attacks are compelling, indicating effective modeling and implementation. 3. **Realism**: The emphasis on simulating real-world adversarial behavior enhances the practical relevance of the research. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Potential for Misuse**: The research contains warnings about potentially harmful text, raising ethical concerns regarding the dissemination of knowledge that could empower malicious actors. 2. **Generalizability**: The research is contingent upon the architecture of specific models (e.g., LLaMA-3 and Mistral), which may limit generalizability across other architectures or future models. 3. **Lack of Defensive Strategies**: While the paper presents a strong offensive framework, it does not provide corresponding defensive techniques, which limits its utility for practitioners concerned with securing LLMs. In conclusion, the paper presents a substantial advancement in the study of LLM vulnerabilities through multi-turn attack simulations. Nevertheless, the ethical concerns around the research, its potential misuse, and the focus on specific architectures temper its overall impact. Therefore, while the work is indispensable for the field, it may warrant cautious consideration regarding its applications. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren.

### **[CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14264v1)**
- **Authors**: Xiaojun Tang, Jingru Wang, Guangwei Huang, Guannan Chen, Rui Zheng, Lian Huai, Yuyu Liu, Xingqun Jiang
- **Classification**: eess.IV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image" addresses the challenges faced in evaluating the fidelity of images restored through Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, particularly those enhanced by recent advancements such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Traditional Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) techniques fall short, as they do not adequately measure the perceptual quality of restored images. The authors propose a new Image Quality Assessment system that evaluates fidelity through a methodology termed Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI), rather than direct comparisons with reference images. They introduce a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm to assess consistency across various degradation types without needing prior knowledge of the degradation parameters. Additionally, they propose a Reference Agnostic CDI method that eliminates the requirement of reference images altogether. To substantiate their method, the authors created a new dataset, the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD), for subjective evaluations, illustrating that their CDI approach significantly outperforms traditional Full Reference IQA methods in assessing BIR fidelity. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several notable contributions to the field of Blind Image Restoration (BIR) and Image Quality Assessment (IQA).  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The introduction of Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI) provides a fresh perspective on assessing BIR quality, a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on direct comparisons with reference images. This shift in approach addresses the critical issues of solution non-uniqueness and degradation indeterminacy inherent in BIR.     2. **Methodological Innovation:** The use of wavelet transformations to assess image consistency indicates a strong grasp of the technical aspects of image processing, and the development of both Reference Guided and Reference Agnostic methods widens the applicability of their approach significantly. 3. **Dataset Creation:** The introduction of the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluations is a constructive addition to the field, providing resources for performance validation of various methods against a consistent benchmark. 4. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments demonstrate that CDI offers substantial improvements over traditional methods, establishing its effectiveness in real-world applications of BIR. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the proposed CDI method shows superiority over traditional methods, the paper does not adequately discuss its limitations or the conditions under which its performance might degrade. Details regarding the type and extent of image degradations where CDI might fail to provide reliable assessments would strengthen the discussion. 2. **Lack of Extensive Comparative Analysis:** While comparisons with Full Reference methods are made, the paper could benefit from evaluations against other emerging IQA methods, particularly those aligned with deep learning frameworks, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its positioning in the current landscape. 3. **Subjectivity in Dataset Generation:** As the subjective nature of image quality assessment can vary among evaluators, the methodology for creating DISDCD may introduce biases that should be addressed to reinforce the credibility of the findings. This paper effectively introduces a promising paradigm in the evaluation of BIR fidelity, filling a significant gap in current methods. However, for its impact to reach its full potential, further validation and exploration of its boundaries are necessary. **Score: 8**  Overall, the contributions are substantial and hold the potential to significantly influence both BIR and IQA methodologies, earning a high score due to its innovative approach and practical applications. The weaknesses identified, while notable, do not overshadow the overall merit of the work, thus justifying an 8 rather than a higher score.
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, have significantly improved visual quality. However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.

- **Authors**: Sadegh Mahdavi, Muchen Li, Kaiwen Liu, Christos Thrampoulidis, Leonid Sigal, Renjie Liao
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the challenges of training and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on Olympiad-level math problems, which are limited by the quality and size of existing datasets and problems with benchmark contamination. The authors present an automated pipeline utilizing resources from the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum to create AoPS-Instruct, a dataset containing over 600,000 high-quality question-answer pairs. Fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset improves their reasoning abilities. Additionally, they introduce LiveAoPSBench, an evolving benchmark that mitigates contamination through continuous updates from the forum, revealing a decline in LLM performance over time. This indicates that LLMs may rely on prior exposure rather than genuine reasoning skills. Their approach provides a scalable method for developing high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning and sheds light on LLMs' capabilities and limitations. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the interplay between LLMs and complex mathematical problem-solving. The novelty lies in the utilization of the AoPS forum as a rich resource to create a large dataset specifically focused on Olympiad-level problems, addressing a notable gap in the availability of quality training data. Additionally, the introduction of LiveAoPSBench to counter benchmark contamination offers a progressive step towards more reliable evaluations of LLM performance. However, while the creation of AoPS-Instruct and LiveAoPSBench is commendable, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons to existing datasets and benchmarks. For instance, a broader evaluation of how their models perform against leads in the same domain would strengthen their claims of improvement. Furthermore, while the analysis of LLMs' performance decay over time is intriguing, additional insights into the underlying causes and potential mitigations would enhance understanding and provide actionable pathways for future research. In conclusion, the paper contributes meaningful resources and insights that could influence future directions in LLM training and evaluation. However, the execution could be enhanced through deeper analyses and comparisons. Given these factors, the paper demonstrates substantial novelty and significance in the field of LLM research and mathematics, but not without its limitations. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain.

### **[Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294v1)**
- **Authors**: Sullam Jeoung, Yubin Ge, Haohan Wang, Jana Diesner
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes" investigates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, focusing specifically on their political biases. It builds on previous findings that LLMs may reflect political leanings akin to specific political parties but extends this inquiry by examining the conditions and extent of deviations from accurate empirical stances. This study utilizes principles from cognitive science, specifically representativeness heuristics, to evaluate how LLMs may overstate stereotypes related to political positions. Through experimental analysis, the researchers found that LLMs often exaggerate stances more than human respondents and tend to rely excessively on heuristics, leading to misrepresentations and biases in political discourse. The paper also proposes mitigation strategies through prompt adjustments to lessen the influence of these heuristics, demonstrating effectiveness in refining the LLMâs responses. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a novel angle by linking cognitive science concepts to the performance of LLMs in political contexts, specifically through the lens of representativeness heuristics. This interdisciplinary approach is impactful as it sheds light on the mechanisms through which LLMs may perpetuate stereotypes, contributing to the broader discourse on AI alignment with human values.  Despite this, while the utilization of heuristic principles is intriguing, similar vulnerabilities of LLMs have been acknowledged in past studies regarding biases and stereotype reinforcement. Therefore, the novelty comes from the specific focus on political stereotypes rather than general biases, which is a relevant but less explored domain in LLM research. **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The integration of cognitive science findings into the study of political bias in LLMs is a strong feature, allowing for a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The paper employs experiments to showcase the exaggeration tendencies of LLMs relative to human judgments, providing robust data for its claims. 3. **Practical Solutions:** The proposed prompt-based mitigation strategies are actionable, offering immediate implications for developers and users of LLMs in political contexts. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Research:** While the paper addresses political stereotypes specifically, the findings may appear limited without considering other potential biases, leading to a broader understanding of LLM behavior. 2. **Generality of Findings:** The study focuses on specific political issues; thus, its findings may not generalize across all areas where LLMs operate, such as social or cultural contexts. 3. **Limited Novelty in Bias Research:** The implications of biases in LLMs have been examined in various contexts. Although the focus on political stereotypes is useful, it risks being perceived as reiteration rather than a groundbreaking advancement in the field. Given these factors, the paper presents significant findings that matter in the contemporary dialogue about AI and ethics, yet it does tread on familiar ground regarding biases without introducing fundamentally new theories. Thus, while its contributions are valuable, they do not signify an exceptional breakthrough. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them. Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.

### **[MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304v1)**
- **Authors**: Bingzheng Gan, Yufan Zhao, Tianyi Zhang, Jing Huang, Yusu Li, Shu Xian Teo, Changwang Zhang, Wei Shi
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS" addresses the limitations of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for strategic planning by integrating them with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. While MCTS enhances the planning abilities of LLMs, it presents challenges, particularly in tasks where objective rewards cannot be easily defined, such as in question answering. The authors propose a new framework called MASTER that dynamically coordinates multiple agents using a specialized version of MCTS. This system adapts the number of agents to the complexity of the task and streamlines their communication, thereby improving the efficiency of the problem-solving process. The effectiveness of MASTER is demonstrated with experiments that yield new state-of-the-art results, achieving 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty**: The paper introduces a novel framework that leverages LLMs in conjunction with MCTS in a multi-agent context, which is a relatively unexplored area in the intersection of AI methodologies. By addressing the specific challenges of using MCTS for tasks that lack clear objective rewards, the authors reveal potential improvements in accuracy for complex tasks like question answering. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of LLMs with a coordinated multi-agent structure using MCTS is a significant advancement, potentially transforming how problem-solving tasks are approached within AI. 2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors present comprehensive experimental results, surpassing existing benchmarks which lends credibility to the proposed method's efficacy and applicability. 3. **Adaptability**: The frameworkâs ability to adjust the number of agents based on task complexity indicates a sophisticated understanding of resource management in AI systems, which can lead to more efficient computations. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Domain Specificity**: The focus on specific datasets (HotpotQA and WebShop) may limit the generalizability of the results. Other tasks not represented in these datasets could yield different results. 2. **Complexity**: The proposed system introduces additional complexity in communication and coordination among agents, which may present implementation challenges or overhead in practice. 3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While state-of-the-art performance is claimed, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of existing methodologies beyond just the two highlighted datasets. Overall, "MASTER" shows promise and introduces a compelling framework that could influence future research in multi-agent systems and LLMs for problem-solving tasks. However, the need for broader testing and validation limits its immediate applicability. **Score: 8** This score reflects the significant novelty and promising results presented in the paper, balanced by the limitations in generalizability and complexity that could impact practical implementations.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.

### **[PAID: A Framework of Product-Centric Advertising Image Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14316v1)**
- **Authors**: Hongyu Chen, Min Zhou, Jing Jiang, Jiale Chen, Yang Lu, Bo Xiao, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents PAID, an innovative framework for automatic product-centric advertising image design tailored for e-commerce. PAID streamlines the process of ad image creation by integrating four key stages: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Unlike previous models that utilize a fixed background as a basis for layout, PAID allows for dynamic styling by using the product and marketing taglines as the primary inputs. It employs a visual language model for prompt generation, ensuring the background harmonizes with the product, while specific models handle layout and aesthetic background creation. The authors also introduce the PITA and PIL datasets to support their framework. Experimental results indicate that PAID outperforms existing methods in generating visually appealing ad images. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: PAID distinguishes itself by moving away from traditional models that impose layout constraints through fixed background images. Instead, it uses the content as the basis for designing an unrestricted layout, which is a significant shift in how advertising images can be generated.    2. **Sequential Model Architecture**: The framework's sequential design leverages specialized models for each design stage, enhancing the coherence and quality of the final output. This modularity is beneficial for targeted optimizations in each component. 3. **High-Quality Datasets**: By creating PITA and PIL, the authors have provided valuable resources for further research and benchmarking in product advertising image generation. 4. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results showcasing superiority over existing methods add credibility, providing practical evidence of the framework's effectiveness. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the framework offers improvements in certain areas, the paper could elaborate more on limitations or edge cases. For example, how does PAID perform with diverse product types, or does it scale well for bulk ad creation? 2. **Clarity on Generalization**: Although results show better visual appeal, the paper does not extensively discuss how well the proposed methods generalize to various product categories or advertising needs beyond what was tested.  3. **Potential User Adaptation**: The adoption of such models might require user adaptation or design skills that not all e-commerce marketers possess, which could limit practical application in some contexts. 4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Approaches**: The paper could benefit from discussions comparing the proposed method directly with a broader range of contemporary approaches and discussing the nuances that PAID addresses. ### Conclusion Overall, PAID presents a novel and impactful contribution to the field of advertising image design, promising advancements that could automate and improve the quality of e-commerce advertising efforts. The sophistication of the framework suggests significant potential for future research and application; however, its practical implications and adaptability could be more thoroughly explored. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and relevance within the field, bolstered by innovative methodology and empirical validation, but tempered by the absence of deeper discussions on generalizability and broader comparative analysis.
- **Abstract**: In E-commerce platforms, a full advertising image is composed of a background image and marketing taglines. Automatic ad image design reduces human costs and plays a crucial role. For the convenience of users, a novel automatic framework named Product-Centric Advertising Image Design (PAID) is proposed in this work. PAID takes the product foreground image, required taglines, and target size as input and creates an ad image automatically. PAID consists of four sequential stages: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are trained to conduct these sub-tasks. A visual language model (VLM) based prompt generation model is leveraged to produce a product-matching background prompt. The layout generation model jointly predicts text and image layout according to the background prompt, product, and taglines to achieve the best harmony. An SDXL-based layout-controlled inpainting model is trained to generate an aesthetic background image. Previous ad image design methods take a background image as input and then predict the layout of taglines, which limits the spatial layout due to fixed image content. Innovatively, our PAID adjusts the stages to produce an unrestricted layout. To complete the PAID framework, we created two high-quality datasets, PITA and PIL. Extensive experimental results show that PAID creates more visually pleasing advertising images than previous methods.

- **Authors**: Ridhi Jain, Rahul Purandare
- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, to comprehend and analyze concurrency issues in software programming under various memory models. With the growing complexity of concurrent programming, the authors assess the modelsâ competency in identifying concurrency problemsâsuch as data races and deadlocksâunder both sequentially consistent memory models and relaxed memory models like Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO). The evaluation utilizes SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests to measure the modelsâ performance. Results indicate that while advanced models like GPT-4 and Mistral-AI's Large2 show strong capabilities in understanding concurrency issues under sequentially consistent models, they struggle to verify program correctness under relaxed memory models due to difficulties in capturing memory ordering constraints. This study highlights the modelsâ limitations in complex concurrency scenarios and emphasizes the need for ongoing research to improve LLM performance in this critical area of software development. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Understanding the Scope:** The paper addresses a significant challenge in the programming field: the verification of concurrent programs, which is crucial as software systems become increasingly multi-threaded. The evaluation of LLMs in this context presents a novel angle, combining advancements in AI with pressing problems in concurrency. 2. **Evaluation Metrics:** The use of established benchmarks like SV-COMP and ARM Litmus tests provides a robust methodology for evaluating the models. This approach gives credibility to the findings and reflects well on the experimental design. 3. **Highlighting Limitations:** The paper does not shy away from discussing the limitations of LLMs, particularly their struggles with relaxed memory models. This critical examination adds to the paperâs value, as it sets the stage for future improvements in model architecture and training. **Strengths:** - The research connects AI and software engineering, striking a timely chord as programming paradigms evolve. - The paper uses rigorous methodologies and relevant test cases for evaluation, leading to meaningful results. **Weaknesses:** - Limited comprehensive exploration of potential solutions or improvements regarding the shortcomings in verifying correctness under relaxed memory models. - The authors could further explore the implications of their findings on wider software development practices and future research avenues. **Potential Influence:** Given the ongoing advancements in AI and the reliance on LLMs for both classical and emergent programming tasks, the paper's findings might influence how these models are integrated into development tools. However, the limitations identified must be addressed to maximize real-world applicability. **Score: 7**  The score of 7 reflects a balance between the innovative integration of LLMs within a critical area of software development and the notable limitations faced in practical applications. While the research is valuable and provides useful insights, the area of relaxed memory models represents a complex challenge that remains unresolved, which detracts from the paper's overall impact.
- **Abstract**: As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.

- **Authors**: ClÃ©ment Desroches, Martin Chauvin, Louis Ladan, Caroline Vateau, Simon Gosset, Philippe Cordier
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the significant environmental impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights that while AI growth is accelerating, understanding its comprehensive environmental consequencesâincluding energy consumption, hardware production, and end-of-life processesâremains obscure due to a lack of transparency from major AI providers. The authors present a methodology designed to help corporations estimate their AI-related environmental impacts without requiring extensive expertise in AI or Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). Their findings indicate that generative AI models can consume up to 4600 times more energy than traditional models. The study forecasts a dramatic increase in AI electricity use, projecting a rise by a factor of 24.4 by 2030, driven by widespread adoption of generative AI. To mitigate this environmental impact, the authors call for collective actions across the AI value chain, including the establishment of standardized environmental assessments, enhanced transparency, and the creation of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with sustainability goals. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the discussion surrounding the environmental sustainability of AI technologies. Its primary strength lies in the methodological framework it proposes, which can help corporations better understand their environmental footprint associated with AI applications. By quantifying the energy consumption differences between generative models and traditional ones, the authors effectively draw attention to the significant environmental costs of adopting advanced AI technologies. Additionally, the forecasts for future AI electricity usage, based on varying adoption scenarios, provide impactful insights that can influence corporate strategies and policy-making. The call for standardized assessments and a focus on transparency addresses a critical gap in the current AI landscape, potentially driving further research and action in this area. However, the paper does present some weaknesses. While it emphasizes the need for systemic change across the AI value chain, it glosses over the challenges associated with implementing these recommendations, such as potential resistance from various stakeholders or the technical difficulties of establishing standardized metrics. Moreover, while the paper discusses energy consumption, it could further elaborate on other environmental factors and impacts related to AI deployment. Overall, the paperâs contributions are highly relevant in light of increasing global attention on sustainability and corporate responsibility. Its blend of empirical findings and actionable insights strengthens its position in the literature on AI and environmental sustainability. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid methodological contribution and its relevance to both academia and industry, while recognizing its limitations in addressing the complexities of implementing sustainable practices in AI development.
- **Abstract**: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.

### **[GraphBC: Improving LLMs for Better Graph Data Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14427v1)**
- **Authors**: Xu Chu, Hanlin Xue, Zhijie Tan, Bingce Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "GraphBC: Improving LLMs for Better Graph Data Processing" focuses on enhancing the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing graph data, which is often converted into natural language for analysis. The authors highlight a critical issue: the performance of LLMs varies significantly when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language representation is altered. They argue that current methods inadequately represent the context of graph structures due to the random sampling of neighbors, which can lead to inefficient reasoning. To tackle these challenges, the authors introduce GraphBC, a model framework that includes an Order Selector Module to maintain the correct serialization of graph elements and a Subgraph Sampling Module to select more structurally informative subgraphs. They also propose a distilled version of their model, referred to as Graph CoT, alongside techniques for instruction tuning to improve LLM reasoning capabilities in graph-related tasks. Experimental results show that GraphBC significantly enhances performance on benchmarks for node classification and graph question-answering, suggesting improvements in both performance and generalization in LLMs applied to graph data. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty GraphBC presents an interesting and innovative approach to addressing the limitations of using LLMs for graph processing. By focusing on both order preservation in graph representation and effective structural sampling, it provides a unique perspective that extends the applicability of LLMs beyond typical sequential data. The introduction of Graph CoT further amplifies its novelty by enhancing reasoning capabilities through distillation and instruction tuning. However, it is important to recognize that while the integration of these modules is valuable, the paper does not extensively compare its methods to existing models in the field other than highlighting their limitations. This raises concerns about whether these contributions are as groundbreaking as claimed or if they simply serve as refinements of existing techniques. #### Significance The significance of this work lies in its potential to improve LLM applications in graph data processing, which remains a challenging area. By tackling fundamental issues like serialization and representative sampling, GraphBC could lead to more reliable and impactful implementations of LLMs in various graph-related applications, including social networks, biological data analysis, and knowledge representation. #### Strengths - The development of the Order Selector and Subgraph Sampling Modules represents a nuanced understanding of graph data processing. - Empirical results demonstrating improvements on node classification and graph QA tasks provide solid backing for the claims made. - The model addresses key limitations of current practices, enhancing the discourse on LLM applications. #### Weaknesses - The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison against state-of-the-art methods. - Limited insights into how GraphBC scales with larger graphs or more complex tasks could temper perceptions of its applicability. - While the proposed model is novel, it may not fully address all intricacies involved in processing graph data, which could be explored in further research. ### Conclusion Overall, GraphBC represents a meaningful contribution to the intersection of LLMs and graph data processing. It introduces significant improvements that could influence future research and applications in this area. However, the extent of its novelty and impact could be better substantiated with broader comparisons and insights.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects GraphBCâs strong potential and innovative approaches while acknowledging areas for enhancement and further substantiation within the field.
- **Abstract**: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.

### **[Domaino1s: Guiding LLM Reasoning for Explainable Answers in High-Stakes Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14431v1)**
- **Authors**: Xu Chu, Zhijie Tan, Hanlin Xue, Guanyu Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Domaino1s: Guiding LLM Reasoning for Explainable Answers in High-Stakes Domains" addresses the challenge of generating explainable and reasoned responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes areas such as finance and legal queries. Current LLMs tend to produce succinct answers without providing the underlying reasoning, potentially undermining users' trust in those decisions. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the authors propose a novel approach called Domaino1s, which combines supervised fine-tuning and a tree search methodology. This method is supported by the creation of domain-specific datasets (CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k) that facilitate the activation of logical reasoning steps tailored to specific domains. The authors also introduce Selective Tree Exploration for optimizing reasoning paths within the problem space, as well as a new evaluation metric, PROOF-Score, which enriches the assessment of model explainability beyond standard accuracy metrics. The results indicate that Domaino1s outperforms existing models in both stock investment recommendations and legal question answering tasks while providing clearer rationale for decisions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of the paper lies in its focus on high-stakes decision-making domains, expanding on existing CoT methods by integrating self-correction capabilities through their proposed tree search approach and selective exploration. The introduction of domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning is also significant, as it prepares models to better engage with the nuances of complex subject matter. **Strengths:** 1. **Well-defined Problem:** The paper identifies a pertinent issue within LLM applications, particularly in sectors where decision-making carries substantial risk and implications. 2. **Innovative Solutions:** The methods proposed, such as Selective Tree Exploration and PROOF-Score, offer practical advancements aimed at enhancing the reasoning quality and explainability of LLM outputs. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the method improves model performance on benchmark tasks in high-stakes domains. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Potential Overfitting:** The reliance on carefully constructed datasets may limit the models' generalizability to out-of-sample, real-world cases. 2. **Complexity in Implementation:** Combining supervised fine-tuning with tree search methods adds a layer of complexity that may not be easily adopted by all practitioners. 3. **Evaluation Limitations:** While PROOF-Score aims to capture explainability, the paper does not sufficiently address the subjective nature of explainability itself; what constitutes a âgoodâ explanation may vary significantly among users. **Potential Influences:** This work has the potential to influence both academic research and practical applications in areas requiring robust decision support systems. By highlighting the importance of explainability in LLM outputs, it paves the way for future advancements in building user-trust-based AI systems. ### Score After weighing the strengths against the weaknesses and considering the paper's contributions to the advancement of explainable AI in critical applications, I assign the paper a **Score: 8**. This score reflects the paper's meaningful contributions to the field, alongside its potential limitations in practical implications and complexity.
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability.

The authors introduce the CommonWords dataset to evaluate gender bias systematically and uncover specific neuron circuits, including gender and general neurons, contributing to this bias. The research highlights that modifying even a few general neurons can disrupt model performance due to their interconnected nature. To counteract this, the authors propose a novel interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based approaches to selectively target biased neurons while maintaining the model's capabilities. Experimental results indicate that this method effectively reduces gender bias in five LLMs and outperforms traditional fine-tuning and editing methods. The study contributes both a new dataset and a nuanced understanding of bias mechanisms in LLMs, along with effective strategies for mitigation. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper's primary contributions lie in the introduction of the CommonWords dataset and the novel method for interpretative neuron editing. The systematic evaluation of gender bias provides much-needed empirical evidence and clarifies how specific neuron circuits contribute to this issue, which is an important step forward in the field of natural language processing. The authors' approach to tackle bias without compromising the performance of LLMs is particularly noteworthy and addresses a critical challenge in deploying these systems safely. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensive Approach**: The dual focus on creating a dataset and the methodology to mitigate bias offers a holistic framework for understanding and addressing gender bias in LLMs. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental validation across five different LLMs adds robustness to their findings, suggesting the generalizability of their method. 3. **Interdisciplinary Insight**: The integration of causal inference and logit-based approaches showcases an innovative intersection of methods that can inspire future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Beyond Gender Bias**: While the focus is appropriately on gender bias, the paper does not address how the method might adapt to other forms of bias (e.g., racial or cultural) which limits its scope. 2. **Complexity in Implementation**: The proposed neuron editing method may present challenges in practicality and computational efficiency, which could hinder its application in real-world scenarios. 3. **Lack of Longitudinal Studies**: The paper does not include long-term evaluation of the edited models to assess if bias reduction persists over time or with updates to the models. ### Conclusion The paper presents a significant advancement in understanding and mitigating gender bias in LLMs through a novel dataset and interpretive methodology. While it excels in empirical analysis and innovation, the limitations in scope concerning other biases and potential practical complications are notable. Nonetheless, the contribution to both academic and practical realms in AI ethics and bias mitigation is substantial. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, posing challenges for their safe deployment. Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "RealCritic: Towards Effectiveness-Driven Evaluation of Language Model Critiques" introduces a novel benchmark for assessing the critique capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recognizing the importance of critiques in improving LLMs, the authors propose a closed-loop evaluation methodology that focuses on the quality of corrections stemming from critiques. This benchmark includes innovative features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, distinguishing advanced reasoning models from classical ones. Through testing on eight complex reasoning tasks, the findings suggest that classical LLMs underperform compared to advanced models like o1-mini in critique scenarios, showing weaknesses especially in self-critique and iterative critiques. The authors hope that the benchmark will guide future advancements in LLM critique capabilities, and the accompanying code and data are available online. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Benchmarking Approach:** The closed-loop methodology is a significant advancement over traditional open-loop evaluation, as it provides a more direct means to assess the practical outcomes of critiques produced by LLMs. 2. **Comprehensive Features:** The inclusion of various critique forms (self, cross, and iterative) adds depth and versatility to the evaluation process, making the benchmark applicable across different contexts and use cases. 3. **Identification of Model Limitations:** The results revealing that classical LLMs fall short in critique scenarios provide essential insights into their limitations, prompting further investigation into their capabilities and areas for improvement. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Broad Applicability:** While the benchmark is well-constructed, its effectiveness remains to be validated across a broader range of LLMs beyond the ones tested (i.e., o1-mini and classical models). This might limit the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Potential Overfitting to Tasks:** The benchmarking tasks may not cover the full spectrum of possible critique scenarios; hence, while the results are insightful, they risk being narrowly focused on specific contexts or reasoning types. **Conclusion:**  Overall, the paper introduces a valuable tool for the evaluation of LLM critiques, highlighting significant differences in the critique capabilities of different models. However, as with any novel methodology, the potential for broader application and verification remains.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paperâs strong contributions to the field by providing an innovative benchmarking technique and significant findings regarding model capabilities. However, uncertainties regarding the generalizability of the benchmark and its applicability across a wider array of models or tasks prevent it from achieving an even higher score.
- **Abstract**: Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.

As educators increasingly seek efficiency and scalability in assessment, studies like this could catalyze further interest and development in automated feedback mechanisms. However, wider acceptance may depend on additional research validating these findings across varied contexts. **Conclusion:** In light of its rigorous empirical methodology, relevance to pressing educational challenges, and contributions to the discourse on AI in academia, the paper merits a score of 8. While it presents robust findings, its limited scope and the need for further exploration into broader applications slightly temper its overall impact. Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.

- **Abstract**: As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.

### **[Training-Free Style and Content Transfer by Leveraging U-Net Skip Connections in Stable Diffusion 2.*](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14524v1)**
- **Authors**: Ludovica Schaerf, Andrea Alfarano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Leonardo Impett
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Training-Free Style and Content Transfer by Leveraging U-Net Skip Connections in Stable Diffusion 2" introduces a novel approach named SkipInject, which focuses on utilizing the skip connections in the U-Net architecture of Stable Diffusion for style and content transfer. The authors analyze U-Netâs skip connections, particularly noting that the connections from the third encoder block contain significant spatial information, effectively separating content from style. They demonstrate that by injecting representations from this block, they can achieve text-based editing and style transfer. Through comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, the authors claim their approach leads to superior content alignment and structural preservation. **Evaluation:** This paper presents a notable contribution by shifting the focus from widely studied components of diffusion models to the under-explored U-Net skip connections. By highlighting the importance of these connections for separating content and style effectively, it provides a fresh perspective that could inspire further research in the field. Additionally, its approach of being "training-free" can be extremely beneficial for practitioners looking to apply diffusion models without the overhead of additional training. However, the novelty is somewhat hampered by the fact that leveraging skip connections is a well-known technique in deep learning, especially in segmentation tasks. The paper does not extensively explore how SkipInject compares in various scenarios with other methodologies, which leaves room for further validation of its claimed advantages. Moreover, while the results appear promising, the extent of experimental evaluations and comparative analysis with existing methods should be more detailed to fully ascertain the claims made. It would also be beneficial to have a more thorough discussion around potential limitations or scenarios where SkipInject may not perform as efficiently. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the ongoing advancement of style transfer and content editing in image generation. Its emphasis on a less-explored area of U-Net's architecture may spur additional innovations, although more rigorous validation of results would strengthen its impact. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: Despite significant recent advances in image generation with diffusion models, their internal latent representations remain poorly understood. Existing works focus on the bottleneck layer (h-space) of Stable Diffusion's U-Net or leverage the cross-attention, self-attention, or decoding layers. Our model, SkipInject takes advantage of U-Net's skip connections. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our methods state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.

### **[Recommending Actionable Strategies: A Semantic Approach to Integrating Analytical Frameworks with Decision Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14634v1)**
- **Authors**: Renato Ghisellini, Remo Pareschi, Marco Pedroni, Giovanni Battista Raggi
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces an innovative methodology for recommending actionable strategies by merging strategic analytical frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. Traditionally considered separate domains, strategic frameworks (like the 6C model) and decision heuristics (like the Thirty-Six Stratagems) are synthesized using advanced natural language processing techniques. The authors utilize vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to align framework parameters with heuristic patterns. This process is supported by a unique computational architecture that melds deep semantic processing with a unique application of Large Language Models. The integration goes beyond text to include secondary content such as diagrams and matrices, validated through corporate strategy case studies. The proposed plug-and-play architecture demonstrates versatility, suggesting that it can be applied to various frameworks and heuristics, thereby providing comprehensive recommendations for strategic decision-making. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to tackling the longstanding challenge of integrating structured strategic frameworks with intuitive decision heuristics. Historically, these two areas have been viewed as separate, and this paper successfully bridges that gap using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. The systematic mapping of frameworks to heuristics through semantic similarity is particularly noteworthy; however, the reliance on deep semantic processing raises questions about its practical application and accessibility for users without advanced technical expertise. Strengths of the paper include its interdisciplinary approach, innovative integration, and clear demonstration through case studies, which can significantly benefit practitioners involved in strategic planning. However, the paper does not sufficiently address the limitations and potential biases associated with the chosen NLP methods, nor does it explore the implications of its findings on existing theoretical frameworks. The paper's potential influence on the field could be substantial, especially in fields such as business strategy and organizational behavior, where decision-making processes are critical. However, without extensive empirical validation across different contextsâbeyond the corporate strategy cases presentedâit is difficult to gauge the scalability and adaptability of the proposed methodology. Overall, while the authors present a compelling vision for improving strategic decision-making through a novel approach, important questions about applicability and limitations need further exploration. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative aspects and its potential to influence strategic decision-making processes while acknowledging the need for deeper exploration of its practical applications and empirical validation in diverse scenarios.
- **Abstract**: We present a novel approach for recommending actionable strategies by integrating strategic frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. While strategy frameworks provide systematic models for assessment and planning, and decision heuristics encode experiential knowledge,these traditions have historically remained separate. Our methodology bridges this gap using advanced natural language processing (NLP), demonstrated through integrating frameworks like the 6C model with the Thirty-Six Stratagems. The approach employs vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to map framework parameters to heuristic patterns, supported by a computational architecture that combines deep semantic processing with constrained use of Large Language Models. By processing both primary content and secondary elements (diagrams, matrices) as complementary linguistic representations, we demonstrate effectiveness through corporate strategy case studies. The methodology generalizes to various analytical frameworks and heuristic sets, culminating in a plug-and-play architecture for generating recommender systems that enable cohesive integration of strategic frameworks and decision heuristics into actionable guidance.

### **[Towards Scalable Topological Regularizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14641v1)**
- **Authors**: Hiu-Tung Wong, Darrick Lee, Hong Yan
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper addresses the challenge of latent space matching by proposing a scalable topological regularization method that leverages persistent homology. While existing metrics such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy often fall short due to their computational expense and inadequate consideration of geometric and topological properties, the authors introduce principal persistence measures computed from small subsamples to improve efficiency. Their methods include a parallelized GPU implementation to enable larger scale computations and demonstrate stable gradient behaviors for smooth probability densities. The paper showcases its practical implications in various tasks, including shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning, thereby highlighting its potential as a scalable approach to embed topological features in machine learning processes. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of topological regularization within machine learning, particularly addressing the computational limitations inherent in using persistent homology directly. The introduction of principal persistence measures is innovative, resolving issues around gradient continuity and enabling the application of topological analysis on a larger scale, which is a notable contribution. The implementation on GPU adds to the practical value, demonstrating that the proposed method can be applied to real-world problems effectively. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Approach:** The use of principal persistence measures to create effective topological regularizers is a new and relevant contribution. 2. **Diverse Applications:** Testing the proposed method on multiple tasks illustrates its versatility and practical implications, enhancing its relevance for various fields including adversarial machine learning and generative modelling. 3. **Technical Rigor:** A thorough GPU-optimized implementation shows both technical skill and the ability to address scalability issues, an important concern in modern machine learning applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparison with Prior Art:** The discussion of existing topological methods could be more thorough, potentially underscoring the uniqueness and advantages of the new approach in comparison to prior works. 2. **Specificity of Results:** While the results across different tasks are promising, additional quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the case for its superiority. 3. **Dependency on Subsampling:** The reliance on small subsamples for computation might raise questions regarding loss of information from larger datasets, which could be a limitation in certain applications. Overall, the contributions presented in the paper make it a valuable read for researchers in machine learning, particularly in the intersection with topology. The potential for impactful applications, coupled with the innovative technical approach, leads to a strong assessment of the paper's significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a robust contribution with potential for notable influence in the field, while acknowledging some shortcomings that could be addressed in future work for wider acceptance and application.
- **Abstract**: Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.

### **[Investigating the (De)Composition Capabilities of Large Language Models in Natural-to-Formal Language Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14649v1)**
- **Authors**: Ziyao Xu, Houfeng Wang
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Investigating the (De)Composition Capabilities of Large Language Models in Natural-to-Formal Language Conversion" explores the essential abilities of large language models (LLMs) in converting natural language to formal language (N2F). It introduces a novel framework, DEDC, which facilitates semi-automatic sample and task generation to evaluate LLMs' decomposition and composition capabilities during N2F tasks. The findings reveal that advanced LLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in both decomposition and composition when confronted with unfamiliar formal languages. Errors stem from challenges in natural language understanding and the complexities of symbolic systems, which include compositional gaps and the use of non-intuitive symbolic names. The study aims to illuminate these deficiencies to guide future enhancements of LLMs in N2F processes. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The introduction of the DEDC framework is a notable contribution, aiming to deconstruct and analytically assess LLMs' capabilities in a structured manner. Investigating specific issues like compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names in the context of N2F adds an important layer to existing research, which has primarily focused on general performance metrics. However, similar evaluations of LLMs have been conducted in various contexts, which may limit the originality of the approach. Thus, while novel in its specific context, the overall concept is not entirely groundbreaking. **Significance:** The paper addresses a critical aspect of LLM performance that is often overlooked: their ability to understand and manipulate formal language structures. This is essential for applications in programming, legal language processing, and any domain where formalization is key. Therefore, the findings regarding LLM's deficiencies have significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Identifying specific areas of weakness can guide future research, making the paper influential in directing further studies. **Strengths:** 1. **Framework Development:** The DEDC framework enables a systematic evaluation, which can inform a range of studies. 2. **Focus on Specific Capabilities:** Highlighting decomposition and composition provides a clear direction for improving LLMs, a focus that is often missing in broader evaluations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation:** The range of LLMs assessed could be broader to fully substantiate findings across different model architectures. 2. **Methodological Limitations:** The potential biases in sampling and task construction might affect the generalizability of the results. **Potential Influence:** The research paves the way for deeper investigations into LLM capabilities, pushing developers and researchers to focus on enhancing LLM performance in formal language contexts. By elucidating areas where LLMs struggle, this paper could influence both academic research and practical applications significantly. Given the balance of novelty, significance, strengths, and weaknesses, I assign a score of **7**. This reflects a paper that contributes valuable insights and a structured evaluation framework while recognizing the limitations in its originality and breadth of impact. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: To achieve generalized and robust natural-to-formal language conversion (N2F), large language models (LLMs) need to have strong capabilities of decomposition and composition in N2F when faced with an unfamiliar formal language and be able to cope with compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names. To investigate whether LLMs have this set of basic capabilities in N2F, we propose the DEDC framework. This framework semi-automatically performs sample and task construction, allowing decoupled evaluation of the set of decomposition and composition capabilities of LLMs in N2F. Based on this framework, we evaluate and analyze the most advanced LLMs, and the main findings include that: (1) the LLMs are deficient in both decomposition and composition; (2) the LLMs show a wide coverage of error types that can be attributed to deficiencies in natural language understanding and the learning and use of symbolic systems; (3) compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names both affect the decomposition and composition of the LLMs. Our work provides a new perspective for investigating the basic capabilities of decomposition and composition of LLMs in N2F. The detailed analysis of deficiencies and attributions can help subsequent improvements of LLMs.

Future work will need to better understand this variability to create more targeted interventions for improvement. Overall, MedAgentBench is poised to influence the development of LLMs in healthcare by offering a much-needed evaluation framework. It not only advances the field of AI in medical applications but also represents a step towards bridging existing gaps in EMR integration. The potential for real-world application and the encouragement of collaborative research further enhances its significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong novelty and potential impact while recognizing that there are still challenges to overcome in fully realizing the benefits of LLM agents in medical applications. The paper is an important contribution but also signals ongoing work needed to address the variation in model performance and push beyond current limitations.
- **Abstract**: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.

- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel diffusion-based Text-To-Music (TTM) generation model that conditions a UNet structure on both a uni-modal language model (T5) and a cross-modal audio-language representation model (CLAP). By leveraging cross-attention and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), the model utilizes local text representations from T5 and global representations from CLAP. The authors introduce pooling mechanismsâmean pooling and self-attention poolingâto extract global text features directly from T5, reducing dependency on CLAP and optimizing parameter efficiency. The findings indicate that using CLAP embeddings improves text adherence metrics over a T5-only baseline, while direct extraction from T5 enhances generation quality, albeit with slightly reduced adherence. Overall, the approach demonstrates a compact model architecture with competitive performance metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Integration of Modalities:** The innovative combination of local (T5) and global (CLAP) embeddings enhances the ability to generate music that adheres closely to text descriptions, marking a significant advancement in multimodal generation. 2. **Reduction in Model Complexity:** By extracting global representations directly from T5, the authors contribute to the literature by demonstrating a simpler and more parameter-efficient architecture. This could benefit future research that aims to reduce computational overhead. 3. **Empirical Results:** The paper reports detailed experimental results that validate the proposed methods, showing measurable improvements in key performance metrics (FAD and KL). **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Novelty:** While the technique of integrating multiple embeddings is not entirely new, the unique modifications proposed could be seen as insufficiently distinct from existing models if they do not provide fundamentally new insights into text-to-music generation. 2. **Metric Trade-offs:** The trade-off between text adherence and generation quality when using different conditioning techniques suggests a need for better balance in future designs. The marginal differences in performance could imply that further work is necessary to optimize these trade-offs. **Impact on the Field:** The paper provides a meaningful contribution to the realm of TTM generation by illustrating a multidimensional approach to embedding conditioning. This may catalyze additional research into similar architectures that balance efficiency with output quality. However, the modest novelty and reliance on established models might limit its groundbreaking impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the significance of the methodological improvements and practical implications of the findings, while acknowledging the limitations in novelty and the introduced complexities in model performance that hold back a higher score.
- **Abstract**: Diffusion based Text-To-Music (TTM) models generate music corresponding to text descriptions. Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47). Our proposed solution is not only efficient but also compact in terms of the number of parameters required.

### **[An Empirical Study on LLM-based Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14683v1)**
- **Authors**: Shabnam Hassani, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh, Daniel Amyot
- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the classification of food-safety regulations and their relevance to modern software systems designed for compliance. Given the evolving landscape of Industry 4.0, the authors address the gap between traditional technology-independent regulations and the software systems that implement them. They accomplish this through two main efforts: a grounded theory study that categorizes food-safety concepts in relation to systems and software requirements, and an empirical evaluation of BERT and GPT models in classifying legal provisions based on these requirements. The main findings reveal that while GPT-4o outperforms both BERT and simpler models, there is a notable trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning. Additionally, the results suggest that the LLMs show promising applicability beyond Canadian regulations, demonstrating their potential for generalizability across different jurisdictions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution**: The intersection of food-safety regulations and advanced LLMs constitutes a relatively unexplored area in the context of legal and regulatory compliance, particularly as it pertains to Industry 4.0. The paper's dual focus on conceptual framework development and empirical performance assessment of LLMs presents a novel contribution to both the fields of regulatory compliance and NLP applications in law. **Strengths**: 1. **Relevance**: The study addresses an urgent need in the food industry for compliance tools that can efficiently parse and relate legal provisions to software systems. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The grounded theory approach provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding food-safety regulations, while the empirical comparisons between LLMs and baseline models add robustness to the findings. 3. **Generalizability**: The demonstration of LLM effectiveness across different regulatory jurisdictions enhances the practical implication of the study, suggesting that the findings could have wider applicability in various legal contexts. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Context Limitation**: The primary dataset drawn from Canadian regulations may limit the broader applicability of the models in jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks, despite evidence of generalizability. 2. **Trade-offs discussed**: The paper notes the trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning, but it would benefit from more thorough exploration of practical implications in real-world applications. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results indicate superior performance of LLMs over simpler baselines, further exploration of additional comparative models or methods could strengthen the discussion on why LLMs outperform these baselines. **Impact on the Field**: The study opens new avenues for research on automating legal compliance through AI in the food industry and beyond, encouraging further development of LLM applications in regulatory contexts. However, it will require follow-up research to validate findings across more diverse regulatory systems. ### Score Justification Taking into account the novelty of the research, its relevance to current industry needs, and the robust methodological framework, I assign a score of **8**. This score reflects significant contributions to both the fields of food-safety regulation and NLP, while acknowledging the limitations that warrant additional exploration and validation. Score: 8
- **Abstract**: As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.

### **[Rethinking Table Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14693v1)**
- **Authors**: Naihao Deng, Rada Mihalcea
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Rethinking Table Instruction Tuning" addresses a notable gap in current research on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) specifically for table-related tasks. The authors argue that prior studies have not adequately explored the implications of hyperparameter choices on model performance. Through empirical evaluations, they indicate that existing table LLMs show significant declines in out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities when compared to their base models. Their analysis highlights the crucial role of hyperparameters, specifically learning rates, revealing that lower learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while maintaining general performance. The authors present TAMA, which is instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, and they demonstrate that TAMA performs comparably to or better than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in table tasks, while also achieving strong out-of-domain generalization. The findings suggest that careful hyperparameter tuning can lead to more efficient model development and reduced data annotation costs. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Focus**: This paper uniquely addresses the largely overlooked impact of hyperparameter choices on the performance of table instruction-tuning in LLMs, filling an important gap in the literature. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: The authors provide systematic analyses that reveal significant declines in model performanceâa critical observation that can reshape future work in the field. 3. **Practical Implications**: By introducing TAMA, the authors pave the way for more efficient model tuning, potentially lowering costs related to data annotation and model training. 4. **Comparison with Baselines**: The paper positions TAMA against well-established models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, providing a clear context for its impact and relevance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper presents a critical reevaluation of hyperparameters, it could be argued that the focus remains somewhat narrow; more diversity in the types of tables or tasks examined might strengthen the findings. 2. **Generalization Claims**: Although the authors claim improved out-of-domain generalization, the extent to which results can be generalized across different contexts and domains is not thoroughly discussed. 3. **Reproducibility**: The paper does not provide detailed methodologies for how TAMA was specifically tuned, which may pose challenges for reproducibility and further research based on their findings. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents significant contributions by highlighting the often-ignored hyperparametersâ role in table-related LLM performance and effectively introducing a new model, TAMA, which demonstrates improved performance metrics. However, the research could benefit from broader evaluations of different types of data and clearer discussions regarding generalizability and reproducibility. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong contributions to the understanding of table instruction-tuning in LLMs, balanced against the aspects where it could be improved. While the findings have essential implications for future research and practical applications, some areas require further exploration to maximize the paper's impact.
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection.

- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents FlexiGPT, a novel method for pruning and extending large language models (LLMs) to enhance their deployment efficiency on memory-constrained devices. The authors focus on selective pruning of model blocks based on an importance score and replace these blocks with a low-parameter replacement strategy. The replacement mechanism utilizes weight sharing from unpruned blocks and incorporates block-specific low-rank adapters. Key innovations include a metric for the replacement process, output feature normalization, and an initialization scheme based on low-rank singular value decompositions (SVD). The authors report significant empirical gains, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with compression rates of 30% and 40%. Furthermore, FlexiGPT can enhance the performance of smaller models with minimal additional training data and parameter overhead. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**: FlexiGPT introduces a hybrid innovation combining pruning and low-rank adaptations, aiming to address a crucial bottleneck in deploying large models effectively. This dual strategy of pruning and extending effectively mitigates issues related to memory constraints, making it particularly relevant in the era of constrained device deployments. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The method of weight sharing in conjunction with pruning using importance scores is well thought out and contributes to the literature on efficient model deployment. 2. **Empirical Results**: The paper provides solid empirical evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, indicative of practical utility. 3. **Generalization Capability**: The ability to extend smaller models with minimal additional training is a valuable trait that increases FlexiGPT's applicability. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Comparison**: While the paper claims to outperform existing methods, a more detailed comparative analysis with other recent state-of-the-art pruning techniques would strengthen the claims significantly. 2. **Scalability Concerns**: The effectiveness of the proposed method on extremely large models or very diverse NLP tasks remains unclear, and potential scalability challenges are not addressed. 3. **Model Complexity**: Although flexibility is introduced, the inclusion of numerous parameters (low-rank adapters, SVD reconstructions) may introduce complexity that may not be beneficial under all use cases. **Potential Influence**: The flexibility that FlexiGPT provides could significantly impact how organizations implement LLMs, especially in environments with strict resource limitations. The combination of pruning and extension strategies presents a forward-thinking direction in the field of model optimization. ### Final Score Considering the innovative solutions presented and the practical achievements shown in empirical evaluations, while also accounting for some gaps in thorough comparative analysis and scalability concerns, I assign the paper a score of **8**. This score acknowledges the contribution FlexiGPT makes to the field of efficient model deployment while recognizing that further exploration and validation are necessary for broader application and acceptance. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has created a critical need for techniques that enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices without compromising performance. We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.

- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper "Towards Better Understanding Table Instruction Tuning: Decoupling the Effects from Data versus Models" addresses the challenges in comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) that are fine-tuned for table-related tasks due to variations in model architectures and training datasets. The authors fine-tune models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families using public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, particularly on the Hitab dataset, a benchmark for table question-answering. A key contribution of this research is the systematic evaluation that distinguishes the impacts of the training data from that of the base models on performance outcomes. Furthermore, the paper explores how instruction tuning specifically for tables might come with trade-offs regarding general-purpose performance, illuminating the balance between specialization and generalization. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** This paper demonstrates a significant advancement in the understanding of instruction tuning in LLMs specifically focused on table-related tasks. By conducting a systematic study that isolates the effects of different base models and training datasets, it contributes valuable insights to the field of NLP, especially in the context of instruction tuning. The approach of explicitly decoupling data and model effects is a refreshing methodology, pushing the boundaries of previous work that failed to make such comparisons. **Significance:** The findings of this paper are significant, particularly in the growing area of LLM utilization for complex data tasks like table processing, which are essential for applications like data retrieval and automated reporting. The results pave the way for refining future models and understanding the interplay of specialization and generalizationâa critical consideration for all neural architecture applications. By establishing new state-of-the-art performances, it showcases the feasibility of optimizing existing models rather than solely relying on new model architectures. **Strengths:** 1. **Rigorous Methodology:** The authors' methodology of fine-tuning and systematic evaluation lends credibility to their results. 2. **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieving and surpassing previous benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of their approach. 3. **Insightful Analysis:** The paper provides valuable insights into the best practices for instruction tuning, which can influence future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization Issues:** While the study evaluates generalization versus specialization, the implications could be explored in deeper detail. 2. **Limited scope of models:** The choice of models is limited to Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families, which may restrict the general applicability of the findings to newer or alternative architectures. ### Conclusion The paper makes an essential contribution to the field of NLP by clarifying the factors influencing performance in table instruction tuning while simultaneously achieving notable benchmarking results. However, the exploration of implications for generalization could have been more comprehensive. Overall, the study adds considerable understanding and paves the way for further innovation in LLM tuning for specialized tasks. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in natural language processing have leveraged instruction tuning to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, previous works train different base models with different training data, lacking an apples-to-apples comparison across the result table LLMs. To address this, we fine-tune base models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families on existing public training datasets. Our replication achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing table LLMs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on Hitab, a table question-answering dataset. More importantly, through systematic out-of-domain evaluation, we decouple the contributions of training data and the base model, providing insight into their individual impacts. In addition, we assess the effects of table-specific instruction tuning on general-purpose benchmarks, revealing trade-offs between specialization and generalization.

- **Authors**: Ipek Baris Schlicht, Zhixue Zhao, Burcu Sayin, Lucie Flek, Paolo Rosso
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper investigates the consistency of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) to health-related questions translated into multiple languages, focusing on English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. Recognizing that the quality of online health information can differ significantly across languages, the authors enhance the existing HealthFC dataset by introducing a multilingual dimension and categorizing questions by disease type. The study finds substantial discrepancies in the answers provided by LLMs, which raises potential risks of healthcare misinformation. The researchers present a new method for evaluating responses that allows for comparative analysis across languages. Their findings underscore the challenges of utilizing LLMs for healthcare in multi-lingual settings and call for improved alignment in cross-lingual healthcare information dissemination. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's novelty rests in its multidisciplinary approach, addressing a crucial public health concern regarding access to reliable health information across diverse linguistic contexts. By expanding the HealthFC dataset and developing a novel evaluation workflow, the authors contribute both empirical data and a methodological tool for evaluating LLM performance in multilingual healthcare inquiries. This contributes significantly to the discourse on the effectiveness and safety of deploying AI solutions in real-world health scenarios. However, there are notable weaknesses. While the study identifies inconsistencies in responses, it could further investigate underlying causes, such as how different language models or training datasets influence response variations. Additionally, while the expansion of the dataset is commendable, the exploration of only four languages limits the generalizability of findings. There's an implicit assumption that the identified inconsistencies could lead to misinformation without thoroughly examining the implications or context of such misinformationâsuch as the differing health literacy levels across populations. Despite these drawbacks, the work addresses a pertinent issue in AI deployment for health, advocating for crucial advances in ensuring equitable access to reliable health information. This focus on multilingual healthcare raises awareness of the disparities in AI utilityâthat elevating one language (e.g., English) might come at the cost of accuracy for others. Overall, the paper is a meaningful contribution to the field of health informatics and AI for healthcare, prompting future research into multilingual training and evaluation of AI systems. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and importance while accounting for limitations in scope and depth that could further enhance the study's impact. The work is positioned to influence subsequent research directions in multilingual healthcare and AI ethics, making its contributions salient for both academia and practical applications.
- **Abstract**: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare.

### **[The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael Muehlebach, Zhiyu He, Michael I. Jordan
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in nonlinear dynamical systems, focusing on systems with continuous state and action spaces. It proposes an algorithm that achieves a policy regret characterized as $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$ across a broad range of dynamical systems, including finite nonlinear models and those defined by bounded metrics. For systems with compact, real-valued parameter spacesâcommon in contemporary models like neural networksâthe regret is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, thus extending previous findings from linear systems to more complex settings. The algorithms are noted for their simplicity, applicability of prior knowledge, and stable initial performance. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The study provides a significant contribution by extending well-established sample complexity results from linear time-invariant systems to a more general context including nonlinear systems and various forms of dynamics. This expansion is crucial as many real-world systems exhibit nonlinear characteristics, making the findings highly relevant. **Significance:** The results have the potential to impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications in reinforcement learning, particularly in complex environments where incorporating prior knowledge and having robust performance in transient phases are beneficial. Additionally, the discussion on packing numbers adds a nuanced perspective to the existing navigation of function approximations in learning systems, which is a notable addition. **Strengths:** 1. **Broad Applicability:** The inclusion of diverse dynamical systems expands the algorithm's potential utility across different applications. 2. **Rigorous Analysis:** The mathematical rigor in deriving regret bounds contributes to the theoretical foundation of the field. 3. **Practical Relevance:** The focus on simple algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge can enhance practitioners' ability to deploy these methods effectively. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity in Implementation:** While the theoretical frameworks are compelling, the practical implementation of the proposed algorithms for diverse systems can be complex. Clear guidelines or case studies illustrating this could improve accessibility. 2. **Limited Novel Implementation Details:** The paper discusses algorithms in a theoretical context but could enhance its contribution by providing examples or experimental results showcasing how these algorithms perform in simulated environments. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper represents an important step in understanding online reinforcement learning in nonlinear contexts. Its approach to sample complexity is novel and expands the horizon of potential applications. However, the practical implications and full realization of the theoretical results still require further exploration and validation. The combination of theory and a call to practice merits a high evaluation but is moderated by the need for applied depth. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.

### **[Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15915v1)**
- **Authors**: Weihang Su, Yichen Tang, Qingyao Ai, Junxi Yan, Changyue Wang, Hongning Wang, Ziyi Ye, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation" discusses a novel approach to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques that enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Traditional RAG methods utilize in-context knowledge injection, where relevant documents are appended to the input of LLMs to guide generation. However, this method has limitations such as increased computational costs and limited integration of external knowledge into the modelâs internal parameters.  To address these shortcomings, the authors propose "Parametric RAG," which integrates external knowledge directly into the feed-forward network parameters of LLMs using document parameterization. This integration reduces the overhead of processing multiple documents at the input level and deepens the assimilation of external knowledge into the model's inherent knowledge structure. The experimental results indicate that Parametric RAG significantly improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation. Additionally, the authors mention that this method can be combined with traditional in-context RAG approaches for enhanced performance. The paper's code, data, and models have been made publicly available. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:**  The introduction of Parametric RAG presents a significant advancement in the field of LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation. While in-context knowledge injection has been widely accepted, it suffers from performance and efficiency issues that the proposed mechanism directly addresses. The notion of integrating external documents into the model's internal parameters, rather than through input context alone, is an innovative approach that has the potential to reshape how knowledge is utilized within LLMs. This paradigm shift indicates a deeper embedding of external information which is a major strength.  **Strengths:** 1. **Efficiency Improvement:** The paper convincingly argues that the Parametric RAG approach lowers computational costs, an important consideration given the increasing resource demands of LLMs. 2. **Enhanced Capability:** By allowing a deeper integration of knowledge, the approach likely improves the overall capability of LLMs, particularly in reasoning tasks where contextual understanding is crucial. 3. **Practical Relevance:** The authors have made their work accessible through open-sourcing, enhancing the potential for adoption and further research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Parameterization:** The methodâs reliance on document parameterization requires careful consideration of the quality and diversity of the documents being parameterized, which could impact model performance. 2. **Experimental Validation:** While the paper reports significant improvements, details on evaluations across various real-world tasks, datasets, and comparisons to more established methods (like traditional RAG) would strengthen the claims. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The method may face challenges scaling to extremely large models or corpora, which could limit its applicability in some contexts. **Overall Impact:** The proposed methodology is poised to influence future research directions in how knowledge is incorporated into LLMs, potentially inspiring more work on parameter-based integration strategies rather than solely in-context methods. However, the overall impact is contingent on thorough experimental validation across diverse tasks and datasets. ### Score: 8 This score reflects the paper's substantial innovations in addressing pressing limitations of existing RAG methods and its promising implications for improving LLMs. However, the exploratory nature combined with some unresolved scalability and validation concerns prevents a higher score. The contributions are relevant and significant, but further exploration is needed to fully establish their effectiveness across varying contexts.
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) by addressing issues like hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and domain adaptation. In particular, existing RAG methods append relevant documents retrieved from external corpus or databases to the input of LLMs to guide their generation process, which we refer to as the in-context knowledge injection method. While this approach is simple and often effective, it has inherent limitations. Firstly, increasing the context length and number of relevant documents can lead to higher computational overhead and degraded performance, especially in complex reasoning tasks. More importantly, in-context knowledge injection operates primarily at the input level, but LLMs store their internal knowledge in their parameters. This gap fundamentally limits the capacity of in-context methods. To this end, we introduce Parametric retrieval-augmented generation (Parametric RAG), a new RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into the parameters of feed-forward networks (FFN) of an LLM through document parameterization. This approach not only saves online computational costs by eliminating the need to inject multiple documents into the LLMs' input context, but also deepens the integration of external knowledge into the parametric knowledge space of the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that Parametric RAG substantially enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation in LLMs. Also, it can be combined with in-context RAG methods to achieve even better performance.

- **Authors**: Benjamin C. Carter, Jonathan Rivas Contreras, Carlos A. Llanes Villegas, Pawan Acharya, Jack Utzerath, Adonijah O. Farner, Hunter Jenkins, Dylan Johnson, Jacob Penney, Igor Steinmacher, Marco A. Gerosa, Fabio Santos
- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents SkillScope, a tool designed to aid new contributors in Open Source Software (OSS) projects by predicting the specific skills needed to tackle ongoing issues on GitHub. It identifies a significant barrier that new contributors face: the absence of detailed explanations about the skills required for tasks in issue trackers. Previous research has made strides in this area by categorizing issues by type, difficulty, and skills but has not gone into sufficient depth. SkillScope uses large language models (LLMs) and Random Forest techniques to extract and predict a comprehensive set of multilevel programming skills from current issues in Java projects on GitHub. In a validation case study, SkillScope achieved impressive predictive performance, reporting a precision of 91%, recall of 88%, and an F-measure of 89%. The tool has practical implications, enabling project maintainers to better assign and manage tasks within OSS projects. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its approach to enhancing issue tracking systems for OSS. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques (specifically LLMs and Random Forest) to predict fine-grained skill requirements, the paper addresses a critical pain point in the OSS community: onboarding new contributors effectively. This suggests a step forward from simply categorizing issues, as it attempts to provide a deeper understanding of contributor needs. **Strengths:** 1. **Technical Innovation**: The use of advanced machine learning models to derive meaningful skill insights is commendable and indicates a modern approach to problem-solving in software development. 2. **High Prediction Performance**: The reported metrics (91% precision, 88% recall, 89% F-measure) suggest that the tool is highly effective, which is critical for practical adoption by OSS communities. 3. **Real-world Application**: The focus on current issues in popular programming languages like Java ensures relevance, enhancing the likelihood of tool adoption. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While promising, the study primarily focuses on Java projects. Its effectiveness across different programming languages or frameworks has not been evaluated, which could limit its applicability. 2. **Scalability**: The performance metrics are derived from a case study; the paper could benefit from a broader evaluation across various OSS projects to demonstrate scalability and robustness. 3. **User-Centric Considerations**: The paper could further explore the user interface and experience aspects of the SkillScope tool, as usability will significantly influence adoption rates among OSS contributors. In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of software engineering, particularly in the context of Open Source Software development. Given its innovative approach, solid metrics, and practical utility, it holds significant potential for future research and application. However, to reach its full impact, the tool's effectiveness should be validated in a broader context beyond Java. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: New contributors often struggle to find tasks that they can tackle when onboarding onto a new Open Source Software (OSS) project. One reason for this difficulty is that issue trackers lack explanations about the knowledge or skills needed to complete a given task successfully. These explanations can be complex and time-consuming to produce. Past research has partially addressed this problem by labeling issues with issue types, issue difficulty level, and issue skills. However, current approaches are limited to a small set of labels and lack in-depth details about their semantics, which may not sufficiently help contributors identify suitable issues. To surmount this limitation, this paper explores large language models (LLMs) and Random Forest (RF) to predict the multilevel skills required to solve the open issues. We introduce a novel tool, SkillScope, which retrieves current issues from Java projects hosted on GitHub and predicts the multilevel programming skills required to resolve these issues. In a case study, we demonstrate that SkillScope could predict 217 multilevel skills for tasks with 91% precision, 88% recall, and 89% F-measure on average. Practitioners can use this tool to better delegate or choose tasks to solve in OSS projects.

- **Classification**: cs.NI
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and Lyapunov optimization theory to tackle the challenges posed by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking. The authors describe Lyapunov optimization as a framework that allows for real-time short-term decision-making while maintaining system stability in the face of dynamics and multiple optimization objectives typical in UAV scenarios. They introduce a framework that combines generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to enhance the efficiency of solving Lyapunov optimization problems. The paper includes a critical analysis of conventional optimization methods and AI techniques, explores the capabilities of various GenAI models, and validates the proposed framework through a UAV-based case study. Directions for further research are also discussed to encourage continued exploration in this area. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The integration of GenAI with Lyapunov optimization is relatively pioneering, especially within the specific context of UAV-based applications. While Lyapunov optimization is well-established, the fresh approach of combining it with generative models and reinforcement learning establishes a new frontier in operationalizing complex optimization scenarios in real-time environments. The novelty lies in the potential for this combination to address dynamic network conditions that UAVs face, which traditional optimization methods struggle to manage. **Significance:** The application of this work is significant for the fast-developing field of drone networking, particularly as it relates to optimizing network performance and stability in low-altitude conditions, which are expected to grow in importance with the increasing use of UAVs for various applications. However, the success of this work relies on its practical implementation and evaluation beyond theoretical frameworks. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of generative models and reinforcements learning with Lyapunov optimization could set a new standard for efficiently tackling complex optimization issues in fast-evolving environments like UAV networks. 2. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The exploration of various GenAI models and traditional optimization methods ensures that the authors provide a well-rounded examination of the topic. 3. **Future Research Directions:** By outlining prospective avenues for further inquiry, the paper encourages ongoing academic exploration, which can enhance the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Limits:** The case study serves as validation for the proposed framework, but it would benefit from more in-depth experiments across different scenarios to better understand the model's robustness and scalability. 2. **Complexity Issues:** The integration of advanced AI techniques might lead to higher computational complexity, and without careful consideration, it could become less feasible in real-world applications. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, while the paper demonstrates significant innovation and relevance, particularly in the context of UAV networking and dynamic optimization, the evaluation methodology and practical considerations such as scaling and efficiency still require further clarity. The contributions made here have the potential to impact the field positively, primarily as UAV applications expand. **Score: 8**  This score reflects high, but not exemplary, novelty and impact, as the proposed framework opens avenues for advancements but requires additional empirical validation and practical efficacy considerations to fully realize its potential in the field.
- **Abstract**: Lyapunov optimization theory has recently emerged as a powerful mathematical framework for solving complex stochastic optimization problems by transforming long-term objectives into a sequence of real-time short-term decisions while ensuring system stability. This theory is particularly valuable in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking scenarios, where it could effectively address inherent challenges of dynamic network conditions, multiple optimization objectives, and stability requirements. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its unprecedented capability to generate diverse digital content. Extending beyond content generation, in this paper, we propose a framework integrating generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to address Lyapunov optimization problems in UAV-based LAE networking. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of Lyapunov optimization theory and analyzing the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches. We then examine various GenAI models and comprehensively analyze their potential contributions to Lyapunov optimization. Subsequently, we develop a Lyapunov-guided generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning framework and validate its effectiveness through a UAV-based LAE networking case study. Finally, we outline several directions for future research.

### **[Leveraging multi-task learning to improve the detection of SATD and vulnerability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15934v1)**
- **Authors**: Barbara Russo, Jorge Melegati, Moritz Mock
- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Leveraging multi-task learning to improve the detection of SATD and vulnerability" investigates the application of multi-task learning to enhance the detection of Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) and software vulnerabilities. SATD refers to code comments that acknowledge suboptimal solutions made for short-term necessity, which can potentially contribute to vulnerabilities. The authors implemented a model named VulSATD, based on CodeBERT, to automatically identify both SATD and code vulnerabilities. They evaluated this model using the MADE-WIC dataset, which combines functions annotated for both SATD and vulnerabilities. The results indicated no significant difference in detection performance between single-task and multi-task approaches, despite attempts to improve outcomes with a weighted loss function. The study concludes that further investigation into the associations between different types of technical debt and security vulnerabilities is warranted, suggesting that only specific categories of SATD may relate to security concerns. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a relevant investigation in a critical area of software quality, linking SATD and vulnerabilities through machine learning techniques. However, while the application of multi-task learning is a contemporary and promising approach in machine learning, its utility in this particular instance appears limited as indicated by the lack of significant performance improvements compared to single-task methods. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The topic addresses important issues in software engineering, particularly the management of technical debt and its implications for security vulnerabilities. 2. **Methodology:** The paper employs a solid technical framework (CodeBERT) and offers an interesting intersection of machine learning with software maintenance practices. 3. **Future Implications:** It opens avenues for further research by suggesting that not all SATD is equally associated with vulnerabilities, which may direct future studies to focus on more specific technical debt categorizations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Significant Findings:** The central claim of improved detection via multi-task learning is unsubstantiated, with no significant performance difference found, which undermines the paper's main contribution. 2. **Depth of Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of why the expected relationships and performance improvements did not materialize. Additionally, the examination of the nuances within SATD and their varied impacts seems underexplored. 3. **Limited Empirical Contribution:** Given that the findings do not yield substantial new knowledge, it raises questions about how the insights can contribute to practical applications or further advancements in the field. In conclusion, while the research is positioned in a critical area of software engineering, the lack of significant findings and limited exploration of the implications restricts its novelty and impact. The need for deeper analysis and exploration of the relationships established shows that while the research is promising, it does not substantially advance the current understanding or applications in the field. **Score: 5**
- **Abstract**: Multi-task learning is a paradigm that leverages information from related tasks to improve the performance of machine learning. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) are comments in the code that indicate not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs, i.e., technical debt (TD). Previous research has provided evidence of a possible relationship between SATD and the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. In this work, we investigate if multi-task learning could leverage the information shared between SATD and vulnerabilities to improve the automatic detection of these issues. To this aim, we implemented VulSATD, a deep learner that detects vulnerable and SATD code based on CodeBERT, a pre-trained transformers model. We evaluated VulSATD on MADE-WIC, a fused dataset of functions annotated for TD (through SATD) and vulnerability. We compared the results using single and multi-task approaches, obtaining no significant differences even after employing a weighted loss. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation into the relationship between these two aspects of low-quality code. Specifically, it is possible that only a subset of technical debt is directly associated with security concerns. Therefore, the relationship between different types of technical debt and software vulnerabilities deserves future exploration and a deeper understanding.

### **[MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15981v1)**
- **Authors**: Michael Birsak, John Femiani, Biao Zhang, Peter Wonka
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models" introduces MatCLIP, an innovative approach for assigning realistic Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to 3D models in the context of varying shapes and lighting conditions. It highlights the complexities involved in matching PBR materials to static imagesâespecially given the dynamic nature of these materials under different viewing angles. MatCLIP builds on the Alpha-CLIP framework to create descriptors that link PBR material representations with images generated by Diffusion Models or photographs, effectively allowing for the transfer of material attributes without needing detailed knowledge about the relationships between different parts of a 3D object. The authors report impressive results, achieving a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, which surpasses existing methods like PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points across various datasets such as ShapeNet and 3DCoMPaT++. The authors commit to releasing all associated code and data, promoting further research and practical application of their findings. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  MatCLIP presents a notable advancement in the integration of PBR materials with static images, addressing a long-standing challenge in the graphics community. The incorporation of Alpha-CLIP to generate light- and shape-insensitive descriptors marks a significant methodological innovation. This is particularly relevant given the increasing reliance on machine learning to bridge the gap between traditional rendering techniques and realistic material representations.  **Significance:**  The improvement in classification accuracy (76.6%) relative to existing state-of-the-art methods (15 percentage points better than PhotoShape and MatAtlas) indicates not only a technical achievement but also practical applicability, which enhances its significance. The focus on making material assignments consistent across various conditions can influence workflows in computer graphics and gaming, as well as in fields such as virtual reality and architecture. **Strengths:** 1. **Robust Methodology:** The use of an extended Alpha-CLIP model shows robust theoretical grounding and application. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides extensive validation of its results against established methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. 3. **Open Access Commitment:** The promise to release code and data encourages reproducibility and fosters further research in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Specificity of Application:** While the method shows promising results, its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the objects and images used, a factor that could limit broader applicability. 2. **Lack of Deep Comparative Analysis:** There is limited discussion on why MatCLIP outperforms its competitors beyond accuracy metrics; an in-depth analysis of the modelâs performance on different object types or conditions would have provided more insight. **Potential Influence:**  The methodology proposed in MatCLIP represents a key step towards more automated and accurate assignment of PBR materials, which could streamline workflows in various industries reliant on 3D modeling, including gaming, film, and design. **Score Justification:** Taking into account the methodological contributions, empirical results, and practical significance, but balancing this against the limitations in application specificity and comparative analysis depth, a score of 8 is warranted. This reflects strong novelty and potential impact, while acknowledging room for further exploration and validation in diverse contexts. Score: 8
- **Abstract**: Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.

### **[Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhibo Ren, Pritthijit Nath, Pancham Shukla
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents an innovative application of video diffusion models for improving tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting, addressing limitations in current deep learning approaches that fail to adequately capture the temporal dynamics of cyclone evolution. By incorporating additional temporal layers and a two-stage training strategy, the method allows for simultaneous generation of multiple prediction frames, enhancing the model's ability to predict cyclone behavior over time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods by Nath et al., quantifiable by metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The approach extends the reliable forecast window from 36 to 50 hours, showing both superior temporal coherence and competitive single-frame quality. Code for the methodology is publicly accessible for further use and exploration. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies primarily in the employment of video diffusion models with a focus on TC forecastingâa relatively underexplored area within computational meteorology. While there has been a rise in deep learning techniques applied to various aspects of weather prediction, extending the reliable forecasting horizon and improving the quality of predictions are both critical areas that would benefit from advanced methodologies. The paper effectively addresses the shortcomings of treating cyclone evolution as a sequence of independent frames, therefore presenting a meaningful advancement in understanding and predicting TC behavior. However, the paper's impact could be nuanced by a few factors. Firstly, while improvements in forecasting metrics are notable, the benchmark comparisons rest on one previous approach (Nath et al.), potentially limiting the assessment of the method's relative performance within a broader scope of existing approaches. Additionally, the methodology assumes that better temporal coherence directly correlates with improved predictive capabilities, which could benefit from more extensive validation against real-world cyclone events. More real-world testing, alongside comparisons with a wider array of state-of-the-art methodologies, would strengthen the validity of the claims made. Furthermore, the complexity of implementation (i.e., a two-stage training strategy) might hinder replication and wider adoption in operational settings. This could impact the overall applicability of the findings in real-world scenarios, as practitioners might seek simpler and more direct methods for TC forecasting. Despite these weaknesses, the paper represents a progressive step in TC forecasting by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The explicit modeling of temporal dependencies could stimulate further research and development in this domain, promoting more robust forecasting methods overall. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and potential significance within the field of TC forecasting, while acknowledging the need for broader validation and assessment against other methodologies to fully establish its impact.
- **Abstract**: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality.

- **Authors**: Jack Min Ong, Matthew Di Ferrante, Aaron Pazdera, Ryan Garner, Sami Jaghouar, Manveer Basra, Johannes Hagemann
- **Classification**: cs.CR
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces TOPLOC, a novel locality sensitive hashing scheme designed to ensure verifiable inference from large language models (LLMs) while addressing trust issues with inference providers. The proposed method detects unauthorized changes to models or inputs with absolute accuracy, reporting no false positives or negatives during testing. TOPLOC is hardware-agnostic, allowing for rapid validation of inference processes. Importantly, it employs a polynomial encoding strategy that drastically reduces the memory footprint required for storing intermediate results, compressing data needs by 1000 timesâfor instance, requiring only 258 bytes for 32 tokens compared to the traditional 262KB. This innovative approach enhances user verification capabilities, thereby promoting transparency and trust in AI services within decentralized frameworks. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  TOPLOC presents a unique solution to a pressing issue in the field of LLMs, where reliance on third-party providers often introduces significant trust concerns. By leveraging locality-sensitive hashing for intermediate activations, the paper contributes a fresh perspective on model verification that is both practical and scalable. The mathematical innovation in encoding further enhances its novelty by addressing the usual memory constraints associated with model verification. **Significance:** The significance of TOPLOC is considerable, particularly in an age where AI transparency is paramount. With increasing instances of malicious model tampering and rising importance on ethical AI, the ability for users to definitively verify the integrity of LLM computations can lead to more accountable AI ecosystems. Additionally, the approach's applicability across various platforms mitigates concerns about hardware specificity, increasing its potential adoption. **Strengths:** - The empirical results supporting the 100% accuracy claim are a strong point, as they suggest a reliable methodology. - The 1000Ã compression of memory usage is a substantial technical accomplishment, making the scheme desirable for real-world applications where resources are limited. - The broad hardware compatibility enhances its practicality. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper claims no false positives or negatives, the long-term reliability of TOPLOC in diverse, untested operational contexts remains to be seen in future work. - The paper could benefit from a comparativa analysis with existing verification techniques to better contextualize its advantages. - The paper does not discuss potential vulnerabilities or limitations, such as the implications of different types of attacks beyond standard model tampering. **Conclusion:** Overall, TOPLOC represents a meaningful advancement in the verifiability of model inference, addressing a crucial gap in the trust landscape associated with LLMs. Its conceptual and practical contributions mark it as significant; however, the recognition of potential weaknesses indicates areas for further exploration and enhancement. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions and innovative approach to a real-world problem within the AI field while acknowledging some limitations and the need for further validation in wider contexts.
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very capable, but access to the best models currently rely on inference providers which introduces trust challenges -- how can we be sure that the provider is using the model configuration they claim? We propose TOPLOC, a novel method for verifiable inference that addresses this problem. TOPLOC leverages a compact locality sensitive hashing mechanism for intermediate activations which can detect unauthorized modifications to models, prompts, or precision with 100% accuracy, achieving no false positives or negatives in our empirical evaluations. Our approach is robust across diverse hardware configurations, GPU types, and algebraic reorderings, which allows for validation speeds significantly faster than the original inference. By introducing a polynomial encoding scheme, TOPLOC minimizes memory overhead of the generated commits by $1000\times$, requiring only 258 bytes of storage per 32 new tokens compared to the 262KB requirement of storing the token embeddings directly for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our method empowers users to verify LLM inference computations efficiently, fostering greater trust and transparency in open ecosystems and lays a foundation for decentralized and verifiable AI services.

### **[FDLLM: A Text Fingerprint Detection Method for LLMs in Multi-Language, Multi-Domain Black-Box Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Fu, Junfan Chen, Hongyu Sun, Ting Yang, Ruidong Li, Yuqing Zhang
- **Classification**: cs.CR
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel method termed FDLLM, designed for detecting text fingerprints from large language models (LLMs) in environments characterized by their black-box nature. The authors highlight the security concerns associated with the opaque integration of LLMs, where users might inadvertently engage with malicious models. To mitigate this risk, the paper addresses the limitations of existing research which often fails to focus specifically on distinguishing texts generated by various models, rather only categorizing human versus machine-generated content. The authors introduce FDLLM, which utilizes the Qwen2.5-7B model and employs fine-tuning via LoRA to improve detection capabilities across multiple languages and domains. They also developed a new dataset, FD-Datasets, consisting of 90,000 samples from 20 LLMs, to facilitate effective training and evaluation. Experimental results showed that FDLLM outperforms the best existing method (LM-D) by a significant margin of 16.7% in macro F1 score, underscoring its potential utility in enhancing LLM recognition in black-box settings. ### Evaluation #### Novelty and Significance The novelty of FDLLM lies in its focus on text fingerprint detection from LLMs in a black-box environment, an area that has been underexplored in previous research. By creating a dedicated pipeline to differentiate between outputs of various LLMs, the authors address a crucial gap pertinent to security and accountability. The implementation of a multilingual and multi-domain approach reflects an understanding of the diverse contexts in which LLMs are employed today, reinforcing its applicability. However, the paper does present some weaknesses. The reliance on the LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model could introduce limitations if future models exceed the capabilities of Qwen2.5-7B in generating text. Moreover, while the dataset FD-Datasets is extensive, questions remain regarding its quality and representativeness, particularly in capturing the nuances of LLM responses across different contexts. This could affect the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, as the field of LLMs evolves rapidly, there is a risk that detection methods may soon become obsolete if they do not continuously adapt to new models and architectures. In terms of influence, the paper is likely to resonate with researchers and developers concerned with the ethical use of LLMs and the security of automated systems. The identification of malicious models is particularly relevant as the number of LLM applications continues to rise.  Overall, while the study makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing a clear and pressing need, its reliance on existing models and the potential shortcomings in dataset representation warrant a balanced perspective. **Score: 8**  This score reflects solid novelty and impact within the context of security in LLM utilization but acknowledges potential execution limitations related to model dependency and dataset quality, which could influence practical application and future research avenues.
- **Abstract**: Using large language models (LLMs) integration platforms without transparency about which LLM is being invoked can lead to potential security risks. Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users. In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models. However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios. We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges. FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.

The authors identify limitations in current repository-level benchmarks, such as lack of maintainability and insufficiently detailed evaluations. Their proposed method involves a two-step translation process: initially converting the repository's structural components ("skeletons"), followed by a complete translation guided by these skeletons. They present the TRANSREPO-BENCH, which consists of high-quality open-source Java repositories paired with corresponding C# skeletons, unit tests, and build configurations. This enables superior automation and scalability of evaluations through fixed unit tests that adapt for multiple translations. Additionally, they introduce fine-grained evaluation metrics that analyze translation quality at a detailed level, overcoming the limitations of traditional binary assessment methods. Results showcase the framework's capability to address significant challenges in repository-level code translation. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper presents an innovative framework and evaluation benchmarking system that addresses significant gaps in the existing methodologies for code translation. By focusing on repository-level translation instead of isolated functions, it acknowledges the complexities and challenges developers face in real-world applications. The introduction of a two-step translation process and the development of fine-grained evaluation metrics add substantial novelty, especially in terms of offering practical solutions to critical issues in code translation. **Significance:** The significance of this work is marked by its potential impact on enterprise applications and dependency management in code migration projects. As enterprises increasingly adopt advanced programming methodologies, tools that facilitate this transition are highly sought after. The paper contributes valuable insights and methodologies that could lead to improved practices in legacy system modernization. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing Real-World Challenges:** The focus on repository-level translation and inter-module coherence is highly relevant and filled an observable gap in the existing literature. 2. **Automation and Scalability:** The frameworkâs emphasis on automated unit tests enables greater scalability for developers and contributes to efficiency in quality evaluation. 3. **Fine-Grained Evaluation Metrics:** These metrics represent a significant advancement over traditional methods, allowing for more nuanced assessments of translation quality. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limitations of Scope:** While the framework targets Java to C# translation, it remains to be seen how well it could adapt to other programming languages or paradigms, potentially limiting broader applicability. 2. **Evaluation of Practical Use Cases:** The paper would benefit from detailed case studies or user feedback that assesses the framework's practicality and effectiveness in various real-world scenarios. 3. **Complexity in Implementation:** The skeleton-guided approach could introduce complexity in implementation compared to simpler translation frameworks, potentially restraining adoption in time-constrained environments. **Conclusion:** Overall, "Skeleton-Guided-Translation" provides a significant contribution to code translation benchmarks, empowering developers with improved methodologies and metrics to facilitate accurate and efficient code migration strategies. The strengths of the innovative framework largely outweigh its weaknesses, affirmatively influencing the field and providing groundwork for future advancements. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: The advancement of large language models has intensified the need to modernize enterprise applications and migrate legacy systems to secure, versatile languages. However, existing code translation benchmarks primarily focus on individual functions, overlooking the complexities involved in translating entire repositories, such as maintaining inter-module coherence and managing dependencies. While some recent repository-level translation benchmarks attempt to address these challenges, they still face limitations, including poor maintainability and overly coarse evaluation granularity, which make them less developer-friendly. We introduce Skeleton-Guided-Translation, a framework for repository-level Java to C# code translation with fine-grained quality evaluation. It uses a two-step process: first translating the repository's structural "skeletons", then translating the full repository guided by these skeletons. Building on this, we present TRANSREPO-BENCH, a benchmark of high quality open-source Java repositories and their corresponding C# skeletons, including matching unit tests and build configurations. Our unit tests are fixed and can be applied across multiple or incremental translations without manual adjustments, enhancing automation and scalability in evaluations. Additionally, we develop fine-grained evaluation metrics that assess translation quality at the individual test case level, addressing traditional binary metrics' inability to distinguish when build failures cause all tests to fail. Evaluations using TRANSREPO-BENCH highlight key challenges and advance more accurate repository level code translation.

- **Authors**: Yee Chun Tsoi, Kieran M. R. Hunt, Len Shaffrey, Atta Badii, Richard Dixon, Ludovico Nicotina
- **Classification**: physics.ao-ph
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the effectiveness of various generative models, trained with historical ERA5 reanalysis data, in simulating UK windstorms. It compares four different models: a standard GAN, WGAN-GP, U-net diffusion model, and diffusion-GAN, focusing on their ability to accurately represent both spatial and statistical features of windstorms. Findings suggest that each model has unique strengths; for example, the GAN demonstrated variability but lacked alignment on PCA dimensions, while the WGAN-GP performed reasonably well but struggled with extreme events. The U-net diffusion model excelled in spatial pattern generation but failed to capture windstorm intensities accurately. Conversely, the diffusion-GAN showed overall better performance but overestimated extreme conditions. An ensemble approach that leverages the strengths of the individual models is suggested for enhanced reliability. The paper lays groundwork for utilizing generative models in the context of meteorological research and risk assessment for windstorms. ### Critical Evaluation: The paper presents a significant endeavor to apply state-of-the-art generative modeling techniques to a specific area of meteorological research, which is relatively novel. The use of generative models for simulating extreme weather events such as windstorms holds transformative potential as these models can potentially predict and analyze future climatic conditions based on historical data. This could lead to improved forecasting, risk assessment, and preparedness strategies. Strengths of the paper include: - **Innovative Methodology**: Employing diverse generative models provides a comprehensive framework for comparison and identifies their respective strengths and weaknesses.  - **Substantive Findings**: The results offer insights into which models perform well and under what conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of generative models' applications in meteorology. - **Foundation for Future Research**: The suggestion of using an ensemble approach opens new avenues for integrating multiple models, which is vital for improving predictive reliability. However, there are also notable weaknesses: - **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper evaluates four models, more depth in analysis of extreme event performances could be beneficial, particularly regarding the implications of misrepresenting such events. - **Data Limitations**: The reliance on historical ERA5 reanalysis data may limit the generalizability of the findings. Examination of a broader range of datasets could strengthen the conclusions made regarding model performance. - **Lack of Real-World Application Discussion**: While the paper introduces the innovative use of generative models, a more explicit discussion on practical applications, such as real-world implementations in storm prediction frameworks, would enhance its impact. Overall, the paper contributes positively to the field, with a focus on an emerging area of research that could prompt further investigations and applications. However, it would benefit from a more extensive exploration of model limitations in real-world scenarios. **Score: 7**  The score reflects a solid contribution that is innovative and potentially impactful, while acknowledging some limitations in scope and practical application. Nonetheless, the foundation laid by this research for future studies in using generative models in meteorological analyses warrants a favorable yet critical evaluation.
- **Abstract**: This study evaluates the potential of generative models, trained on historical ERA5 reanalysis data, for simulating windstorms over the UK. Four generative models, including a standard GAN, a WGAN-GP, a U-net diffusion model, and a diffusion-GAN were assessed based on their ability to replicate spatial and statistical characteristics of windstorms. Different models have distinct strengths and limitations. The standard GAN displayed broader variability and limited alignment on the PCA dimensions. The WGAN-GP had a more balanced performance but occasionally misrepresented extreme events. The U-net diffusion model produced high-quality spatial patterns but consistently underestimated windstorm intensities. The diffusion-GAN performed better than the other models in general but overestimated extremes. An ensemble approach combining the strengths of these models could potentially improve their overall reliability. This study provides a foundation for such generative models in meteorological research and could potentially be applied in windstorm analysis and risk assessment.

- **Classification**: cs.IR
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "SampleLLM: Optimizing Tabular Data Synthesis in Recommendations" presents a new framework for generating synthetic tabular data tailored for recommendation tasks. The authors identify limitations of existing methods, particularly their inefficiency in handling sparse data and capturing complex feature relationships. They propose SampleLLM, a two-stage process that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to align generated data distributions with target datasets through Chain-of-Thought prompting and advanced importance sampling. The first stage focuses on generating data that fits the target distribution, while the second stage refines this data to rectify any biases. Experimental results show that SampleLLM outperforms conventional methods across various datasets, demonstrating its potential utility beyond recommendation systems. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper contributes meaningfully to the field of data synthesis for machine learning, particularly in the context of recommendation systems. The novelty lies in leveraging LLMs, which have not seen widespread application in tabular data synthesis, and the introduction of a two-stage framework that addresses specific shortcomings of existing techniques. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The integration of LLMs for synthetic data generation in tabular contexts represents a significant step forward. By utilizing Chain-of-Thought prompts and exemplars, the authors improve alignment with target distributions, a common challenge in the field. 2. **Rigorous Methodology:** The two-stage framework strategically targets both generation and refinement, addressing potential biases that can arise in data synthesis, which is a well-thought-out approach. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents robust experimental results across multiple datasets, showcasing the method's effectiveness in practical scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising, the framework may require extensive customization to work effectively across different domains outside recommendations. The performance on extremely diverse datasets may not mirror the results showcased. 2. **Complex Implementation:** The approach involves a complex pipeline that may present challenges in implementation and interpretation for practitioners who are not deeply versed in LLMs or feature attribution methods. 3. **Lack of Comparison on Real-world Applications:** Although the paper includes online deployment testing, further exploration of performance in real-world settings and integration with existing systems would enhance its applicability and validation. **Conclusion:** The findings and methodology proposed in this paper have the potential to influence future research on data synthesis, particularly in recommendation systems and tabular data contexts. However, challenges related to generalizability and practicality of implementation temper the impact of the work. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovative approach and empirical backing, balanced by concerns regarding broader applicability and complexity in real-world use.
- **Abstract**: Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems. This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.

### **[Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16147v1)**
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Lu, Hao Lu, Hua Huang
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors" addresses the challenges of acquiring sufficient high-quality training data for deep portrait matting models. The authors highlight the difficulty of obtaining large datasets, particularly as the best ground-truth data is typically collected using green screens. To overcome this limitation, they introduce a method that utilizes text prompts alongside a recent Layer Diffusion model to generate portrait foregrounds and derive latent portrait mattes. However, initial models suffer from generation artifacts, prompting the authors to develop a connectivity-aware approach to refine these mattes based on observed connectivity in portrait images. The authors subsequently created the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, which encompasses 20,051 portrait foregrounds paired with high-quality alpha mattes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that models trained using this dataset outperform those using alternate datasets. The authors also compare their approach with traditional chroma keying methods and conduct an ablation study regarding dataset capacity, validating the effectiveness of their approach. Finally, they indicate that the dataset also advances video portrait matting applications through a straightforward video segmentation and trimap-based image matting model. ### Critical Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper exhibits significant novelty by introducing a method that leverages both generative techniques and connectivity priors, a combination that is less explored in the context of portrait matting. The creation of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset represents a substantial contribution by providing high-quality training data vital for improving model performance in portrait mattingâa topic that suffers from a lack of datasets. Moreover, the connectivity-aware approach to refining generated mattes offers an innovative solution to a common problem in image generation. #### Significance: The significance of this work is underscored by its practical implications in both portrait and video matting applications. By enhancing the quality of generated mattes and creating a large, useful dataset, the authors set a new benchmark for future studies in this field. The demonstrated performance improvements over previous datasets mark a notable advancement in portrait matting methodologies.  #### Strengths: - The proposed methods effectively address a prominent limitation in deep learning for portrait mattingâdata scarcity. - The LD-Portrait-20K dataset provides a large-scale resource that can foster further research and application in both still and video portrait matting. - Extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of the proposed techniques, enhancing their credibility in the academic community. #### Weaknesses: - The reliance on generative models may still raise questions regarding the consistency and fidelity of generated images compared to real-world captures. - While the connectivity-aware approach is promising, its effectiveness may vary across different portrait styles or conditions, and such limitations warrant further empirical exploration. - The paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the limitations and potential biases in the generated datasets. #### Conclusion: Overall, the paper introduces a critical advancement in portrait matting, combining innovative approaches to data generation and refinement. While it shows promise and offers significant contributions, it would benefit from clearer discussions on the limitations and implications of its methods in broader contexts. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.

- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "PATCH: Empowering Large Language Model with Programmer-Intent Guidance and Collaborative-Behavior Simulation for Automatic Bug Fixing" introduces a novel framework called PATCH aimed at improving the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors identify a gap in current approaches, which often treat bug resolution as a single-stage task focusing solely on buggy code snippets. Instead, PATCH adopts a stage-wise approach that comprises four key phases: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. This method emphasizes the importance of collaborative behaviors inherent in software development. By enriching the context of the buggy code with dependence and intent information and simulating interactive resolutions between LLMs, PATCH aims to enhance the accuracy of patch generation. The framework leverages the dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT and demonstrates improved performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs through evaluation on the BFP benchmark. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: PATCH introduces a structured, stage-wise framework that addresses the collaborative nature of software bug resolution, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods that treat bug fixing as a singular task. This framework can help emulate human-like reasoning in debugging processes.    2. **Enhanced Input Context**: The focus on augmenting buggy code with relevant context and intent information is a novel approach that likely provides the model with better guidance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of generated patches. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper reports empirical results that indicate PATCH outperforms existing LLMs on the bug-fixing benchmark BFP, providing a compelling validation of its effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on a Specific LLM**: While utilizing ChatGPT is a strength, the work's reliance on this specific model may limit its generalizability. The performance gains may not be applicable across different LLM architectures or in diverse programming contexts.    2. **Lack of Human Evaluation**: The paper primarily centers on performance metrics; however, it could benefit from qualitative assessments or human evaluations of the generated patches to gauge real-world applicability and effectiveness. 3. **Complexity in Implementation**: The multi-stage approach, while conceptually appealing, may introduce additional complexity in implementation that could deter practical adoption in real-world scenarios. **Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of PATCH lies in its holistic approach to bug fixing by incorporating programmer intent and collaborative behaviors. The framework has the potential to influence how future research is conducted in automated software maintenance and bug resolution. While the paper demonstrates important advancements, the reliance on a specific model and a somewhat narrow focus on quantitative metrics somewhat diminishes its broader applicability. In conclusion, considering the strengths of introducing an innovative framework, effective use of context, and empirical support against existing LLMs but also recognizing the weaknesses related to implementation complexity and model dependency, I would assign a score of **7**. This reflects a commendable contribution to the field with room for further exploration and validation. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance. Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs. However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor. Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage. To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH. Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches. Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs. We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.

### **[MILP initialization for solving parabolic PDEs with PINNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16153v1)**
- **Authors**: Sirui Li, Federica Bragone, Matthieu Barreau, Kateryna Morozovska
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents a method to improve the convergence speed of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by optimizing the initial weights of the neural network. Traditional PINN approaches typically use random weight initialization, which can lead to slow convergence. To address this issue, the authors propose a convex optimization model focused on initializing the first layer of the neural network, effectively termed "pre-training." They explore two variations of this pre-training: one based solely on boundary conditions and the other integrating physics into the initialization process. The method is tested on the heat diffusion equation, revealing that the boundary pre-training approach yields the fastest convergence among the tested methods. **Evaluation**: The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the ongoing challenge of convergence in PINNs, particularly in the context of solving parabolic PDEs. The use of a convex optimization model for initializing weights represents a significant departure from conventional approaches, which typically rely on random initialization. This reflects a thoughtful integration of optimization techniques into deep learning, potentially paving the way for similar strategies in other applications within the field of computational physics. **Strengths**: 1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of convex optimization for weight initialization in PINNs is innovative and addresses a critical limitationâconvergence speed. 2. **Clear Practical Application**: The authors effectively demonstrate the utility of their method through a relevant application concerning the heat diffusion equation, which enhances the understanding and significance of their findings. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: By assessing two distinct pre-training strategies, the study provides valuable insights into how boundary and physics-informed approaches affect convergence. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Evaluation**: The paper predominantly focuses on one type of PDE (the heat diffusion equation). While this is valuable, additional testing on a broader range of PDEs would strengthen the findings and generalizability of their approach. 2. **Limited Discussion on Broader Implications**: While the paper identifies improved convergence as a benefit, it could discuss more explicitly how these methods could be adapted or scaled to various other applications in physics or engineering. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper effectively addresses a significant challenge in the field of PINNs and demonstrates potential for practical applications. While it presents a substantial contribution, the limited scope of the experimental validation narrows its impact. However, the innovation in methodology does position this work as a meaningful advancement in enhancing the computational efficiency of PINNs. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful deep learning method capable of providing solutions and parameter estimations of physical systems. Given the complexity of their neural network structure, the convergence speed is still limited compared to numerical methods, mainly when used in applications that model realistic systems. The network initialization follows a random distribution of the initial weights, as in the case of traditional neural networks, which could lead to severe model convergence bottlenecks. To overcome this problem, we follow current studies that deal with optimal initial weights in traditional neural networks. In this paper, we use a convex optimization model to improve the initialization of the weights in PINNs and accelerate convergence. We investigate two optimization models as a first training step, defined as pre-training, one involving only the boundaries and one including physics. The optimization is focused on the first layer of the neural network part of the PINN model, while the other weights are randomly initialized. We test the methods using a practical application of the heat diffusion equation to model the temperature distribution of power transformers. The PINN model with boundary pre-training is the fastest converging method at the current stage.

- **Authors**: Xin Huang, Tarun Kumar Vangani, Zhengyuan Liu, Bowei Zou, Ai Ti Aw
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "AdaCoT: Rethinking Cross-Lingual Factual Reasoning through Adaptive Chain-of-Thought" presents a novel framework named AdaCoT designed to improve the multilingual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While these models exhibit solid reasoning skills, their effectiveness often varies across different languages due to disparate training data availability. Previous strategies such as machine translation and extensive multilingual tuning face limitations and often do not adequately address nuanced reasoning needs.  AdaCoT introduces a method of dynamic reasoning that utilizes intermediary âthinking languagesâ to facilitate the thought processes leading to responses in the target language. Central to this technique is a language-agnostic core with an adaptive, reward-based mechanism that selects the most effective reasoning paths without necessitating further pretraining. The authors conduct extensive evaluations against a range of benchmarks, showcasing significant enhancements in factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, particularly benefiting low-resource languages. The findings indicate that the model can effectively narrow the performance disparities between high-resource and low-resource languages while preserving their unique cultural and linguistic features. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  AdaCoT introduces an innovative approach to multilingual reasoning by utilizing adaptive reasoning pathways through intermediary thinking languages, which stands out from conventional methods relying heavily on direct translations or extensive retraining. This concept is relatively novel compared to existing architectures. However, the notion of using intermediary representations or reasoning steps is not entirely new and has been observed in other contexts related to cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. The careful balancing of engagement with low-resource languages does offer a fresh perspective, although the idea of optimizing thought processes is a broader theme in artificial intelligence. **Significance**: The significance of AdaCoT lies in its potential impact on addressing the underperformance of LLMs in low-resource language contexts. Given the increasing need for multilingual models in global applications, this work could play a vital role in promoting inclusivity in language technology. The emphasis on retaining linguistic and cultural nuances while improving logical reasoning across languages also touches on critical ethical considerations in AI and linguistics. **Strengths**: 1. The adaptive mechanism for selecting reasoning pathways is a strong point that could lead to practical applications in real-world multilingual systems. 2. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks reinforce the claims of enhanced performance. 3. Strong results in low-resource languages address a significant gap in existing research and application. **Weaknesses**: 1. The explanations and justifications for the reward-based adaptive mechanism could be further elucidated, as they are crucial for understanding the practical applicability of AdaCoT. 2. The paper might benefit from more detailed comparisons with a wider array of existing approaches to contextualize its advancements fully. 3. The scalability of the proposed framework in even narrower low-resource situations or dialectal variations could be examined more thoroughly. In conclusion, while the paper presents promising advancements that could significantly affect future deployments of multilingual AI systems, its broader theoretical implications and practical constraints warrant a cautious appraisal of its novelty relative to existing work in the field. **Score**: 7
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to uneven training data distribution. Existing approaches using machine translation, and extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes through intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.

- **Authors**: Zhongjin Luo, Yang Li, Mingrui Zhang, Senbo Wang, Han Yan, Xibin Song, Taizhang Shang, Wei Mao, Hongdong Li, Xiaoguang Han, Pan Ji
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents BAG (Body-Aligned Asset Generation), a method designed to generate 3D wearable assets that can be automatically fitted onto 3D human bodies. The authors tackle the challenge of 3D shape generation for wearables, which has not been adequately explored in prior works. BAG operates by leveraging body shape and pose data to guide the generation process. Initially, a single-image to multi-view image diffusion model is developed using the Objaverse dataset, ensuring diversity and generalizability. A Controlnet is then trained to produce body-aligned multi-view images from the 2D projections of the target body. This data feeds into a 3D diffusion model to create the final asset shape. The methodology includes recovering transformation details to prevent asset-body penetration through physics simulation, resulting in accurately fitted 3D assets. Experimental results indicate improved capability over existing methods, particularly in image prompt adherence, shape diversity, and quality. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper reveals several notable strengths and potential weaknesses that shape its overall significance in the field: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Application**: The exploration of 3D asset generation specific to wearables is a fresh area of investigation, addressing a significant gap in existing 3D shape generation models which primarily focus on non-wearable shapes. 2. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The use of human body shape and pose to condition the generation process is innovative. This body-alignment approach is a crucial aspect that enhances output relevance to actual human forms. 3. **Utilization of Large Datasets**: Training on the expansive Objaverse dataset should theoretically enhance the modelâs performance across different body shapes and styles, which is critical for generating diverse and realistic wearables. 4. **Integration of Physics Simulation**: Addressing penetration through physics is a practical enhancement that adds realism and usability to generated assets, setting it apart from simpler shape generation methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Dataset Quality**: The performance directly relies on the quality and diversity of the Objaverse dataset. If the dataset lacks specific styles or types of clothing, this may limit the utility of the BAG model. 2. **Complexity and Computational Costs**: The multifaceted approach involving various models may introduce high computational costs, making it less accessible for developers working with limited resources. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the authors claim significant improvements over existing methods, a deeper analysis with more quantitative results and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods would solidify their claims. **Potential Influence**: The impact of BAG on fields like fashion design, virtual fittings, and gaming can be profound, given the increasing intersection of 3D modeling with augmented reality and virtual try-on technologies. However, the method's reliance on complex processing could hinder widespread adoption among smaller enterprises or individual developers. **Conclusion**: Overall, while BAG addresses a significant challenge in 3D asset generation, some reliance on dataset quality and complexity issues could restrict its immediate applicability. The potential for future research and commercial applications is clear, indicating a promising direction for further explorations in 3D wearable asset generation. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: While recent advancements have shown remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation models, the challenge of leveraging these approaches to automatically generate wearable 3D assets remains unexplored. To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality.

### **[SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)**
- **Authors**: Wenxuan Xie, Fanpu Cao
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces SWIFT, a lightweight model designed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) in resource-constrained environments like edge devices. The model leverages three innovative strategies: (i) wavelet transform for lossless downsampling of time series, (ii) a learnable filter for cross-band information fusion, and (iii) a compact mapping of sub-series using a single shared linear layer or a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Through comprehensive experiments, SWIFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, showcasing its efficiency and efficacy in deployment. Notably, the parameter count of SWIFT-Linear is only 25% compared to a traditional single-layer linear model for time-domain predictions, enhancing its suitability for practical applications. The accompanying code is accessible for further research and implementation. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The core novelty in the paper lies in the combination of wavelet decomposition for data downsampling and cross-band information fusion through a learnable filter, which can significantly improve model performance on non-stationary data. The focus on resource efficiency while maintaining accuracy is particularly relevant in today's context where edge computing is increasingly prevalent for time-series forecasting. However, while the techniques employed are interesting, wavelet transformations and MLP mappings are established methodologies within the field. The combination is relatively less common, though not groundbreaking.  **Significance:** The implications of SWIFT are substantial for practitioners in scenarios with limited computational resources. By achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, the model addresses a critical gap in the literature regarding the scalability of forecasting models on edge devices. The focus on LTSF also broadens the applicability of this research, potentially transforming how industries like finance and IoT handle predictive analytics. **Strengths:** - The approach is well-justified and grounded in existing methodologies while introducing useful innovations. - The paper's experimental validation shows strong results, contributing to its credibility. - Open sourcing the code enhances reproducibility and allows for further exploration by the research community. **Weaknesses:** - The paper may lack depth in comparing against a wider array of lightweight models or more comprehensive baselines, potentially overselling its advantages. - There is limited exploration of the practical limitations and trade-offs in deploying SWIFT in real-world settings beyond computational efficiency. - The novelty of integrating pieces from existing methodologies raises questions about the extent of the incremental advancement. Considering these dimensions, the paper presents a balanced contribution through novel integration of methods while addressing a significant need within the field. However, its reliance on pre-established concepts and the comparative scope limits its impact somewhat. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong, but not exceptional, contribution to the field. The work is innovative enough to warrant recognition but does not fundamentally alter existing paradigms or introduce widely new concepts.
- **Abstract**: In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

### **[The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16182v1)**
- **Authors**: Chuanyang Zheng
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer" addresses the limitations posed by the softmax attention mechanism in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which suffers from quadratic time and memory complexity, making it less feasible for high-resolution images. The authors propose a new linear attention method that maintains the FÃ¤higkeit of ViTs to capture global representations without the computational inefficiencies of traditional methods like Swinâs local window attention. They identify that linear attention misses a key feature of softmax attentionâthe concentration of the attention matrix distribution. To remedy this, they introduce a local concentration module, resulting in a novel architecture known as LÂ²ViT. This architecture effectively integrates both linear global attention and local window attention, achieving linear computational complexity while excelling in performance. The experiments demonstrate that LÂ²ViT achieves an impressive 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without additional training data and 87.0% with further pre-training. Additionally, LÂ²ViT shows strong performance in downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. ### Rigorous Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper offers a significant advancement in the field of computer vision by addressing a critical limitation of ViTs, specifically their computational inefficiency with high-resolution data. The formulation of a local concentration module to enhance linear attention represents a noteworthy innovation, as it directly tackles the observed shortcoming of linear attention lacking attention concentration, a fundamental property that contributes to effective visual representation. The introduction of the LÂ²ViT architecture is particularly noteworthy, as it promises to bridge the gap between global and local attention mechanisms while retaining linear complexity. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Design**: The creation of a local concentration module enhances the previously developed linear attention mechanisms, which is a novel contribution to the body of knowledge. 2. **Performance Metrics**: Demonstrating high accuracy on ImageNet-1K indicates robust empirical validation of the proposed architecture, making it a compelling model for both classification and downstream tasks. 3. **Broader Applicability**: The modelâs capability to efficiently process high-resolution images expands the practical applications of ViTs in various computer vision tasks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors provide empirical results, the paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of comparisons with various existing attention mechanisms beyond just Swin, particularly in diverse contexts and datasets. 2. **Conceptual Clarifications**: The explanation of how linear attention fails to concentrate attention as effectively as softmax could be unpacked further, providing deeper insights into the theoretical implications of this observation. **Conclusion:** The paper presents a meaningful contribution to the field of computer vision through its innovative approach to linear attention in ViTs. By enhancing the attention mechanism while maintaining computational efficiency, it sets a foundation for future research into more scalable ViT architectures. While some aspects could be examined in greater detail, the overall impact and relevance to current challenges in the field are clear. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.

### **[Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16191v1)**
- **Authors**: Antony Bartlett, Cynthia Liem, Annibale Panichella
- **Classification**: cs.SE
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs" addresses the challenges developers face when fixing dependency issues in Python. Traditional automation methods relying on knowledge graphs and database lookups fall short due to the complexity and variety of dependency errors. The authors introduce a novel technique called PLLM (pronounced "plum"), which leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help a large language model (LLM) automatically resolve these issues. PLLM creates a testing environment that iteratively engages with the LLM to suggest module combinations, test them, and refine the suggestions based on error messages identified during testing. The technique was benchmarked against two leading automatic dependency resolution methods, PyEGo and ReadPyE, using the Gistable HG2.9K dataset. Results show that PLLM can fix significantly more dependency issues than the other approaches, indicating its potential, especially for projects with complex dependencies and those utilizing popular numerical and machine-learning libraries. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper offers a fresh approach to an enduring problem in software engineeringâthe resolution of dependency conflicts in Python. By utilizing LLMs for dependency inference, the work deviates from traditional static analysis and knowledge graph approaches. The introduction of the PLLM technique, in particular, represents a meaningful advancement, as it combines retrieval-augmented generation and a feedback mechanism from build errors to iteratively improve suggestion accuracy. **Strengths:** - **Use of LLMs:** The application of LLMs to infer module requirements is innovative, capitalizing on advancements in natural language processing. - **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors conducted rigorous benchmarking against two prominent alternatives, demonstrating substantial improvements in the ability to resolve dependency issues quantitatively. - **Iterative Improvement with RAG:** The use of feedback loops to refine suggestions based on real-time error messages is a sophisticated method that enhances the model's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** - **Scope and Generalization:** The evaluation is limited to a specific dataset (Gistable HG2.9K), and it is unclear how PLLM performs across a broader array of Python projects or with real-world applications that might have different types of dependencies. - **Complexity in Use:** While automation is a key goal, the iterative testing approach may introduce delays in environments where immediate fixes are needed. **Impact on the Field:** The implications of this research are significant, as dependency resolution often hinders software development efficiency. If circulated widely and adopted in development environments, PLLM could vastly improve developer productivity and reduce the frustration associated with dependency management. However, the cautious interpretation of results due to potential dataset bias calls for further validation in diverse coding scenarios. ### Final Score: Considering the novelty, methodology, empirical support, and potential impact, I assign the paper a score of **8**. Although it offers a commendable contribution to the automated resolution of dependency issues, the limited scope of evaluation and the practical implementation concerns temper its overall significance.  **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters. Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency issues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.

- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images" presents an innovative technique for enhancing the brightness of underwater images, which typically suffer from challenges such as reduced visibility with increasing depth. Unlike most existing methods that focus on noise removal and color adjustments, this work emphasizes brightness enhancement through a novel unsupervised learning approach utilizing a conditional diffusion model. The method incorporates a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation (SNR) map to maintain detail and prevent color distortion during training. The effectiveness of UDBE is demonstrated through its performance on established benchmarks (UIEB, SUIM, and RUIE) and is evaluated using multiple image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, UISM), indicating strong robustness and performance in brightness enhancement. ### Critical Evaluation: #### Strengths: 1. **Novelty in Approach**: The method's focus on unsupervised brightness enhancement using a diffusion model is relatively unique in the domain. The integration of conditional diffusion to preserve brightness detail is a noteworthy advancement over conventional methods. 2. **Thorough Benchmarking**: The evaluation against well-established datasets underscores the reliability of the results. The authors provide detailed comparisons using commonly accepted image quality metrics, enhancing the credibility of their findings. 3. **Potential Impact**: Given the increasing significance of underwater imaging in various fields (like marine research, underwater robotics, and environmental monitoring), improving brightness could have broader implications for enhancing visibility in challenging environments. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper addresses brightness enhancement, it does not comprehensively tackle other critical factors affecting underwater images, such as color balance or distortion due to varying water conditions. This might limit its applicability in more complex scenarios. 2. **Unsupplied Code Details**: Although source code availability is mentioned, the paper would benefit from further elaboration on how to implement the method, including any prerequisites or specific hardware requirements, which might restrict accessibility for some potential users. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could further strengthen its case by comparing UDBE not just with related methods in brightness enhancement but also with comprehensive image enhancement techniques that integrate multiple aspects beyond brightness adjustment. ### Conclusion: The UDBE paper represents a meaningful contribution to the niche field of underwater image processing, particularly with its innovative focus on unsupervised brightness enhancement through a diffusion-based methodology. However, its limited scope and a somewhat technical presentation might restrain its immediate applicability. In light of these factors, I assign a score of **Score: 7**. This reflects a strong contribution with considerable potential, combined with room for further exploration and integration of additional enhancement techniques in future work.
- **Abstract**: Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process.

- **Authors**: Nadezhda Chirkova, Thibault Formal, Vassilina Nikoulina, StÃ©phane Clinchant
- **Classification**: cs.CL
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Provence: efficient and robust context pruning for retrieval-augmented generation" addresses the challenges associated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the computational overhead from long contexts and the incorporation of irrelevant information into outputs. The authors propose "Provence," a context pruning framework designed to dynamically identify and remove non-relevant parts from retrieved contexts for optimized Question Answering. This framework comprises three main components: treating the pruning task as sequence labeling, integrating pruning with context reranking, and training on a diverse dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that Provence maintains performance across various domains while significantly reducing computational costs. The paper also includes an analysis and various ablations to support future training methodologies for context pruners. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its synthesis of context pruning and reranking as well as the introduction of a method that adapts dynamically to varying input contexts. By framing context pruning as a sequence labeling task, it distinguishes itself from previous methods that often took a static approach. This innovative perspective can be beneficial in promoting more adaptive models which are critical given the varied nature of inputs in real-world applications of LLMs. The significance of Provence is particularly noted in its practical applicability across multiple domains, addressing a critical need for efficiency in RAG pipelines. The authors provide compelling evidence of Provence's effectiveness through extensive experimentation, presenting results that indicate negligible performance drops, an important consideration for practitioners in the field. Furthermore, the inclusion of a deeper analysis and ablation studies strengthens the paper by giving insight into how the framework can be tailored or improved for specific tasks. However, while Provence is undoubtedly beneficial, the paper could further discuss potential limitations or scenarios where pruning might lead to loss of crucial information, thereby compromising the quality of generated responses. Additionally, the authors could explore the broader implications of their methodology in more diverse and complex real-world scenarios rather than focusing on managed datasets. Overall, the paper contributes substantially to the current landscape of retrieval-augmented generation by providing a robust solution to existing limitations of contextual processing in LLMs. Its integration of pruning and reranking offers a unique approach that is likely to influence future developments in this area. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's innovative approach and practical significance in enhancing LLM efficiency through context pruning, while acknowledging the need for further exploration of its limitations in complex scenarios.
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation improves various aspects of large language models (LLMs) generation, but suffers from computational overhead caused by long contexts as well as the propagation of irrelevant retrieved information into generated responses. Context pruning deals with both aspects, by removing irrelevant parts of retrieved contexts before LLM generation. Existing context pruning approaches are however limited, and do not provide a universal model that would be both efficient and robust in a wide range of scenarios, e.g., when contexts contain a variable amount of relevant information or vary in length, or when evaluated on various domains. In this work, we close this gap and introduce Provence (Pruning and Reranking Of retrieVEd relevaNt ContExts), an efficient and robust context pruner for Question Answering, which dynamically detects the needed amount of pruning for a given context and can be used out-of-the-box for various domains. The three key ingredients of Provence are formulating the context pruning task as sequence labeling, unifying context pruning capabilities with context reranking, and training on diverse data. Our experimental results show that Provence enables context pruning with negligible to no drop in performance, in various domains and settings, at almost no cost in a standard RAG pipeline. We also conduct a deeper analysis alongside various ablations to provide insights into training context pruners for future work.

- **Authors**: Huayu Li, Xiwen Chen, Ci Zhang, Stuart F. Quan, William D. S. Killgore, Shu-Fen Wung, Chen X. Chen, Geng Yuan, Jin Lu, Ao Li
- **Classification**: cs.AI
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support model designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in visual inspection tasks specific to medical time-series data, like arrhythmia detection and sleep staging. While LLMs have shown impressive results comparable to human clinicians, their broad application limits accuracy in specialized medical domains, and the proprietary nature of their weights prevents finer adjustments for specific tasks. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) achieve high precision in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning that complex clinical decisions require. ConMIL addresses these limitations by utilizing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to pinpoint clinically relevant segments in time-series data, combined with conformal prediction for producing calibrated outputs that improve interpretability. Experimental results indicate that integrating ConMIL significantly boosts the performance of existing LLMs, exemplified by the Qwen2-VL-7B model showing substantial gains in accuracy for specific clinical tasks. --- ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The integration of SSMs with LLMs via ConMIL is a notable innovation, as it effectively combines the strengths of both model typesâcontextual reasoning from LLMs and precision from SSMs. 2. **Contribution to Medical AI**: By focusing on enhancing interpretability and contextual reasoning in medical time-series analysis, the work is relevant to both AI research and the healthcare field, where decision support is critical. 3. **Quantitative Improvements**: The reported performance gains (from 46.13% to 94.92% in arrhythmia detection, for instance) are substantial, indicating that the method has practical applicability and might significantly aid clinicians. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the results are impressive, the paper does not sufficiently address whether the findings can be generalized across diverse medical datasets beyond those tested. 2. **Complexity**: The proposed model, although innovative, introduces additional complexity that may be a barrier for clinical adoption. The integration of two model types could complicate training and implementation in real-world settings. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper predominantly focuses on comparing ConMIL with specific LLMs but does not address how it compares to other emerging methods in the field of medical AI or decision support systems. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper presents a valuable approach that bridges the gap between state-of-the-art LLM capabilities and the precision required for specific medical tasks. However, its generalizability and practical complexity could be points of concern for its widespread adoption in clinical practice.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field of medical AI, particularly for its innovative integration of models aimed at improving clinical decision-making accuracy and interpretability. However, reservations about generalizability and practical implementation prevent it from reaching a perfect score.
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.

- **Abstract**: Many important scientific problems involve multivariate optimization coupled with slow and laborious experimental measurements. These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.

- **Abstract**: Source camera identification has emerged as a vital solution to unlock incidents involving critical cases like terrorism, violence, and other criminal activities. The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.

- **Authors**: Youran Sun, Babak Haghighat
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper investigates the scaling behaviors of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of physics, specifically using concepts from phase transitions and the field theory model known as the $O(N)$ model. The authors reformulate the Transformer architecture within this framework to explore two significant phase transitions. The first transition relates to the temperature during text generation processes, allowing for the estimation of the modelâs internal dimensionality. The second transition, identified as a higher-order transition, suggests the emergence of advanced capabilities as model parameters increase. Additionally, the energy metrics from the $O(N)$ model provide insights into whether the parameters of an LLM are adequate for learning from the training data. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The paper effectively bridges the fields of machine learning and theoretical physics, opening avenues for innovative analyses of LLMs using established physical concepts. 2. **Foundational Insights:** The identification of two distinct phase transitions offers new perspectives on how LLMs scale with parameter size and text generation temperatures, contributing valuable theoretical foundations for understanding model behaviors. 3. **Implications for Design:** By relating model energy to learning sufficiency, the paper offers practical implications for researchers and practitioners in optimizing LLM architectures. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Rigor:** While the transition identification is novel, the paper may lack detailed mathematical rigor in establishing the connections between the $O(N)$ model and real-world LLM behaviors. More empirical validation could enhance the credibility of the claims. 2. **Generalizability of Findings:** The analysis primarily focuses on the Transformer architecture; it remains unclear how widely applicable these insights may be across different architectures or applications beyond LLMs. 3. **Limited Practical Applications:** Although the discussions around phase transitions are intriguing, the immediate applicability of the findings might be limited for practitioners, who typically seek actionable insights rather than theoretical frameworks. **Overall Assessment:** This paper contributes notably to the theoretical understanding of LLMs by applying concepts from physics, illustrating significant findings regarding phase transitions and potential applications in model design evaluation. However, the limitations in theoretical rigor and practical application suggest that while the contributions are meaningful, they may not fully resonate or impact the field as widely as more actionable research outcomes. ### Score: 7 This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and valuable theoretical insights but acknowledges the need for more rigorous validation and broader applicability in practical contexts within the machine learning community.
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit unprecedentedly rich scaling behaviors. In physics, scaling behavior is closely related to phase transitions, critical phenomena, and field theory. To investigate the phase transition phenomena in LLMs, we reformulated the Transformer architecture as an $O(N)$ model. Our study reveals two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the temperature used in text generation and the model's parameter size, respectively. The first phase transition enables us to estimate the internal dimension of the model, while the second phase transition is of \textit{higher-depth} and signals the emergence of new capabilities. As an application, the energy of the $O(N)$ model can be used to evaluate whether an LLM's parameters are sufficient to learn the training data.

The effectiveness of URAG is supported by experimental results, and a case study conducted at HCMUT demonstrates its practical applicability and positive reception within the educational sector. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the intersection of AI, Natural Language Processing, and education. Its primary strength lies in addressing the operational challenges associated with implementing RAG in university admission chatbots. By proposing a hybrid URAG Framework, the authors offer a promising solution to enhance accuracy without the accompanying complexities and costs often associated with existing state-of-the-art methods. However, the paper's novelty could be tempered by the fact that the foundational elements of RAG have been previously explored in other contexts, and while the hybrid approach is intriguing, the specific contribution to educational chatbots may not wholly encapsulate an innovative paradigm shift. A more thorough differentiation from prior works could enhance the impact of the findings. Moreover, the case study provides a practical validation, but additional metrics concerning user experience, scalability, and adaptability across different institutions would bolster its claims regarding generalizability and effectiveness. Without comprehensive data on these aspects, it is difficult to assess the framework's robustness. In terms of significance, while the findings are valuable for researchers developing chatbots, the practical influence of this work could face constraints due to the specificity of its application. The paper's reliance on positive feedback does not substitute for rigorous quantitative validation. Overall, the paper presents relevant insights that could pave the way for future research and applications in educational AI systems but could benefit from deeper analytical grounding and broader applicability.  **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.

- **Authors**: Jiayi Hong, Christian Seto, Arlen Fan, Ross Maciejewski
- **Classification**: cs.PF
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the visualization literacy of two leading Large Language Models (LLMs), OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini, through a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT). Despite their ability to generate descriptions and suggestions for visualizations, the study finds that these LLMs do not exhibit comparable levels of visualization literacy to the general public. Specifically, the models often relied on pre-existing knowledge rather than the information from the visualizations when answering questions. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in visualization evaluation and identifies significant limitations that hinder their effectiveness as evaluative tools in this domain. ### Evaluation The paper presents novel research by addressing a relatively unexplored area concerning the capabilities of LLMs in evaluating and interpreting visualizations. This is significant in the context of visualization research, where human data evaluation has been a bottleneck due to logistical challenges. The authors conducted rigorous experiments, providing insights into the current limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs. The paper is well-structured, detailing methodology and findings comprehensively. However, several weaknesses dampen its impact. Firstly, the study does not delve deeply enough into potential reasons for the LLMs' reliance on pre-existing knowledge, which would be beneficial for further research. Secondly, the sample size and diversity for the VLAT should be scrutinized; more context on the comparison with human performance may yield deeper insights. Lastly, while the paper touches on the implications for future research, it lacks concrete recommendations on how LLMs could be improved for better visualization literacy or how they could be integrated into visualization studies effectively. Overall, the study opens up valuable discussions and lays the groundwork for future explorations into LLM capabilities in visualization, but it also demonstrates the limitations inherent in current LLM technology. This combination of novelty and limitation justifies a moderately high but not exceptional score. Score: 7
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we assess the visualization literacy of two prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), the backend of ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini, previously known as Bard, to establish benchmarks for assessing their visualization capabilities. While LLMs have shown promise in generating chart descriptions, captions, and design suggestions, their potential for evaluating visualizations remains under-explored. Collecting data from humans for evaluations has been a bottleneck for visualization research in terms of both time and money, and if LLMs were able to serve, even in some limited role, as evaluators, they could be a significant resource. To investigate the feasibility of using LLMs in the visualization evaluation process, we explore the extent to which LLMs possess visualization literacy -- a crucial factor for their effective utility in the field. We conducted a series of experiments using a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) for GPT-4 and Gemini. Our findings indicate that the LLMs we explored currently fail to achieve the same levels of visualization literacy when compared to data from the general public reported in VLAT, and LLMs heavily relied on their pre-existing knowledge to answer questions instead of utilizing the information provided by the visualization when answering questions.

The method utilizes a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align various modalities into a cohesive representation. The experiments demonstrated significant enhancements in diagnostic accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, which indicates its potential application in clinical settings. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper contributes notably to the current discourse in the field of neurological disorder analysis by addressing the underutilization of 3D medical imaging and the benefits of combining multiple data modalitiesâtext and images. This dual approach is particularly important in medical contexts where comprehensive analysis often leads to better clinical outcomes. Strengths: 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The introduction of the brain-adapter using a lightweight bottleneck layer presents a significant innovation in adapting pre-trained models for specific medical tasks without requiring extensive computational resources. 2. **Practical Relevance:** By demonstrating improvements in diagnosis accuracy, the proposed method could facilitate better clinical workflows, making it highly relevant for practitioners. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The extensive experiments highlight the robustness of the method, although details on the dataset and metrics used would strengthen this aspect.

- **Abstract**: Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.

- **Authors**: Weixin Liang, Junhong Shen, Genghan Zhang, Ning Dong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu
- **Classification**: cs.LG
- **Summary**: **Summary** The paper proposes Mixture-of-Mamba, an innovative state space model (SSM) architecture that improves multi-modal pretraining by introducing modality-aware sparsity. This advancement draws from the prior work of Mixture-of-Transformers, creating a framework that utilizes modality-specific parameterization to capitalize on the unique features of different data types within existing computationally efficient SSMs. The authors test the Mixture-of-Mamba model across three pretraining scenarios: Transfusion, Chameleon, and a three-modality framework involving speech. The results demonstrate that Mixture-of-Mamba achieves comparable loss values to previous models at significantly reduced computational costs, illustrating its efficiency and effectiveness in multi-modal contexts. Key findings include significantly lower training FLOPs needed to reach equivalent performance levels in comparison to traditional approaches, as well as findings from an ablation study indicating the effectiveness of decoupling model components. **Critical Evaluation** **Novelty:** Mixture-of-Mamba presents a meaningful advance in the realm of multi-modal SSMs by innovating upon the existing framework of sparse parameterization. While the idea of modality-aware sparsity is not entirely new, applying it effectively to SSMs represents a fresh approach that extends beyond Transformers. The introductory combination of modality awareness into the SSM architecture is noteworthy, and the specific applications to multi-modal pretraining paradigms reflect a careful consideration of the field's needs. **Significance:** This work has the potential to affect ongoing research in sequential modeling, especially in areas where different modalities (text, images, speech) need to be integrated efficiently. By reducing computational costs while maintaining performance, this model could facilitate wider adoption of SSMs in practical applications that handle rich, diverse datasets. **Strengths:**  - The architecture demonstrates significant computational efficiency, suggesting it could enable more robust applications in real-world scenarios. - The systematic evaluation across three distinct frameworks provides comprehensive insights into the capabilities of the proposed model. - The ablation study reinforces the findings and suggests relevant areas for future improvements and research. **Weaknesses:**  - While the model achieves reduced computational costs, the paper does not deeply address potential trade-offs in model complexity or interpretability that may arise from using sparsity. - The exploration of the model's performance in practical, less controlled environments might be beneficial. - There could be a concern regarding the generalizability of the model across other tasks that were not evaluated. **Influence on the Field:** The contributions of Mixture-of-Mamba may set a new standard for future multi-modal SSMs, providing a solid foundation for further research that incorporates modality-aware designs. However, its ultimate impact will largely depend on subsequent validation across a broader range of tasks beyond the evaluated settings. **Score: 8** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, considering its innovative approach and potential benefits, while acknowledging the need for additional exploration into long-term effects and broader applications. The paper successfully highlights an important architectural advancement, which could pave the way for more efficient multi-modal modeling in the future.
- **Abstract**: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining.

### **[FALCON: Resolving Visual Redundancy and Fragmentation in High-resolution Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Registers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16297v1)**
- **Authors**: Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie
- **Classification**: cs.CV
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces FALCON, a novel model designed to enhance high-resolution multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by addressing two key problems: visual redundancy and fragmentation in visual encoding. Existing methods primarily utilize cropping techniques, which lead to increased redundancies in visual tokens and fragmentary representations. FALCON employs a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism that introduces learnable visual registers aimed at aggregating important visual information while reducing redundancies. This results in a more compact visual encoding without the need for additional compression mechanisms. Furthermore, to maintain continuity in visual encoding that may suffer due to fragmented inputs, the model incorporates a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module allows for effective interaction between visual registers, enhancing information flow and coherence across sub-images. Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly reduces visual token counts while improving performance across various high-resolution benchmarks. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** FALCON introduces a fresh perspective on managing high-resolution visual data within MLLMs. The incorporation of visual registers is a novel contribution that effectively targets redundancy, a critical issue in prior methods.    2. **Performance Gains:** The reported results indicate that FALCON achieves a significant reduction in visual tokens (by 9-fold to 16-fold) while maintaining or improving model performance, suggesting that the introduced mechanisms are both effective and impactful. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct a thorough set of experiments across a diversity of benchmarks, lending credence to the claims of enhanced performance and systematic benefits of the proposed model structure. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Applicability:** While innovative, the model's reliance on adaptive learnable components (visual registers) could complicate implementation and scalability. The effectiveness of FALCON on datasets other than those tested remains unclear and may limit its broader applicability. 2. **Comparative Baselines:** While the paper demonstrates performance improvements, it would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of existing state-of-the-art models to firmly establish its relative advantages in different scenarios. 3. **Potential Overfitting:** Introducing multiple new components might lead to risks of overfitting, especially on smaller datasets, which could be a consideration that needs addressing in future work. **Overall Assessment:** FALCON presents a compelling advancement in MLLM technology, resolving notable issues related to visual input processing effectively and innovatively. However, its complexity and the need for broader benchmarking could hinder immediate adoption. The combination of technical soundness and significant performance enhancements underscores its importance in the field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects FALCONâs strong innovative contribution and potential to influence research in multimodal models, balanced by concerns regarding implementation complexity and the need for broader validation against various models and datasets.
- **Abstract**: The incorporation of high-resolution visual input equips multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enhanced visual perception capabilities for real-world tasks. However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.

However, the limitations identified warrant caution regarding the systemic applicability of the findings in practical scenarios. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution that could influence the field of autonomous monitoring, but it acknowledges the need for further empirical validation and exploration of practical challenges.
- **Abstract**: Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.

It allows custom runtime configurations for the number of layers and sequence lengths, making it suitable for various real-world scenarios while addressing computational constraints. The proposed system employs cascaded self-distillation to maintain re-ranking precision and a factorized compensation mechanism with two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules to mitigate precision loss from layer and sequence compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Matryoshka Re-Ranker outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets, showcasing robust performance despite using various compression techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the Matryoshka Re-Ranker lies in its flexible architecture that allows for runtime customization, which is a relevant and significant addition to the field of text re-ranking. By enabling users to tailor model depth and width according to resource availability, it effectively addresses the efficiency bottlenecks often encountered with large language models in practical applications. The incorporation of techniques like cascaded self-distillation and a compensation mechanism showcases an innovative approach to dealing with the inherent trade-offs involved in flexibility versus precision. However, the paper has certain weaknesses. While it provides a strong empirical performance analysis, it lacks a deep theoretical foundation to explain why the proposed techniques such as the factorization compensation yield better results. Straightforward experiments might not fully capture the model's performance across diverse real-world applications outside the studied datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the potential simplicity of the implementation may not explore all the complexities involved in high-stakes applications where precision is critical, and the implications of using reduced models can lead to systematic errors. In summary, while the Matryoshka Re-Ranker demonstrates innovative approaches to a pressing challenge in utilizing LLMs efficiently, its empirical focus could be complemented with a stronger theoretical grounding and broader testing environments. **Score: 7**
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful foundations to perform fine-grained text re-ranking. However, they are often prohibitive in reality due to constraints on computation bandwidth. In this work, we propose a \textbf{flexible} architecture called \textbf{Matroyshka Re-Ranker}, which is designed to facilitate \textbf{runtime customization} of model layers and sequence lengths at each layer based on users' configurations. Consequently, the LLM-based re-rankers can be made applicable across various real-world situations. The increased flexibility may come at the cost of precision loss. To address this problem, we introduce a suite of techniques to optimize the performance. First, we propose \textbf{cascaded self-distillation}, where each sub-architecture learns to preserve a precise re-ranking performance from its super components, whose predictions can be exploited as smooth and informative teacher signals. Second, we design a \textbf{factorized compensation mechanism}, where two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules, vertical and horizontal, are jointly employed to compensate for the precision loss resulted from arbitrary combinations of layer and sequence compression. We perform comprehensive experiments based on the passage and document retrieval datasets from MSMARCO, along with all public datasets from BEIR benchmark. In our experiments, Matryoshka Re-Ranker substantially outperforms the existing methods, while effectively preserving its superior performance across various forms of compression and different application scenarios.

- **Abstract**: Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content. Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information. This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information. These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query. Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries. Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video. Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.

- **Classification**: physics.med-ph
- **Summary**: **Summary:** This paper investigates the efficacy of utilizing a large language model (LLM), specifically the Llama 3.1 405B model, to automate the summarization of CT simulation orders within the field of radiation oncology. A total of 607 CT simulation orders were sourced from a clinical database, and these were systematically categorized based on treatment modalities and disease sites. Customized prompts were developed in collaboration with therapists to guide the LLM in generating summaries. The generated summaries were compared against manually created "ground truth" summaries, with the results showing that approximately 98% of the LLM-produced summaries were accurate. Additionally, improvements in summary formatting and readability were reported. The findings highlight the LLM's consistent performance across various treatment contexts, indicating its potential utility in reducing therapist workload and enhancing workflow efficiency. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a significant area of need within radiation oncology: the automation of summarizing clinical documentation, which is a labor-intensive task for therapists. By evaluating the performance of a state-of-the-art LLM in this context, the authors provide a tangible application of artificial intelligence in improving clinical workflows. The study employs a robust methodology, including the use of a large dataset and collaboration with clinicians to inform the LLM's usage. The reported accuracy and improvements in readability of the generated summaries are notable strengths that suggest practical applicability in a clinical setting. However, there are limitations that warrant attention. While the high accuracy rate is impressive, the study would benefit from a more extensive examination of the generalizability of the Llama model across different institutions and broader clinical scenarios. Additionally, potential biases in the dataset, the methodology for deriving ground truth summaries, and the subjective evaluation by therapists could introduce inconsistencies that are not adequately addressed in the paper. The novelty of applying LLMs in summarizing medical documentation has been noted in several studies; therefore, while this study advances the field, it is not entirely pioneering in its application. Despite these weaknesses, the study's contribution to workflow efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in summarizing CT simulation orders is valuable. It points toward a future where LLMs can support clinicians significantly, potentially allowing them to focus on patient care rather than administrative documentation. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's significant contributions to the intersection of artificial intelligence and clinical workflows, tempered by the need for further validation and exploration of the broader applicability of the findings outside the specific context examined.
- **Abstract**: Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference. Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.

- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "RelightVid: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Video Relighting" presents a novel framework, RelightVid, aimed at overcoming challenges in video relighting through the application of diffusion models. While diffusion models have excelled in image generation and editing, their use in video has been hindered by issues such as the absence of paired datasets and the need for temporal consistency and fidelity. RelightVid addresses these concerns by allowing various relighting conditions, including background video, text prompts, or environment maps. The framework is trained on a diverse set of in-the-wild videos and utilizes illumination augmentations to maintain high temporal consistency. Notably, it does this without the need for intrinsic decomposition and while preserving illumination priors from image models. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The approach of using a diffusion model for video relighting is a significant innovation as it cuts across traditional boundaries in video processing. By focusing on a framework that allows for flexible relighting inputs and is trained on diverse video sources, the authors have introduced a mechanism that is likely to set a benchmark in the field. The proposed method's capability of achieving temporal consistency while maintaining high fidelity adds to its uniqueness. **Significance:** The significance of the work is underscored by the persistent challenges in video relighting, particularly given the growing importance of video content creation and editing in various fields, including gaming, film, and virtual reality. The potential applications of this technology may influence creative processes and lead to advancements in related fields, thereby reinforcing its importance. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The application of diffusion models to video relighting introduces fresh perspectives in the field. 2. **Performance:** The high temporal consistency achieved through training on diverse videos is impressive and addresses a key limitation in previous models. 3. **Versatile Input Conditions:** The ability to handle multiple inputs (video, text prompts, environment maps) broadens the applicability of the model significantly. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Extensive Benchmarking:** While the authors mention general performance metrics, comprehensive comparisons against existing state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the findings. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** The effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios and varying lighting conditions may need further exploration and validation. 3. **Decomposition Claim:** The assertion that it accomplishes relighting without intrinsic decomposition should be substantiated with rigorous empirical results, as this is typically a key aspect of photorealistic video relighting. **Potential Influence:** The paper's contribution has the potential to inspire further research into temporal video editing and set the stage for advancements in related areas, such as augmented reality and content creation tools that leverage machine learning for enhanced visual effects. Based on these assessments, I assign the paper a score of 8. While it presents a noteworthy innovation with clear practical implications, some weaknesses in empirical validation and benchmarking remain that prevent it from being categorized as an exceptional contribution at the highest level. **Score: 8**
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.
