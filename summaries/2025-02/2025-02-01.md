- **Abstract**: Cybersecurity education is challenging and it is helpful for educators to understand Large Language Models' (LLMs') capabilities for supporting education. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in conducting a variety of penetration testing tasks. Fifteen representative tasks were selected to cover a comprehensive range of real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of 6 models (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama 3.1 405B, Mixtral 8x7B and WhiteRabbitNeo) upon the Metasploitable v3 Ubuntu image and OWASP WebGOAT. Our findings suggest that GPT-4o mini currently offers the most consistent support making it a valuable tool for educational purposes. However, its use in conjonction with WhiteRabbitNeo should be considered, because of its innovative approach to tool and command recommendations. This study underscores the need for continued research into optimising LLMs for complex, domain-specific tasks in cybersecurity education.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper investigates the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in enhancing penetration testing education by evaluating their effectiveness across fifteen representative tasks in real-world scenarios.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17549v1)
- **Authors**: Wooyoung Kim, Byungyoon Park, Wooju Kim
- **Abstract**: Graph-structured data plays a vital role in numerous domains, such as social networks, citation networks, commonsense reasoning graphs and knowledge graphs. While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex textual-attributed graph data.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel method called Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT) aimed at enhancing graph representation for tasks involving graph-structured data. The LGPT addresses limitations in current graph neural networks, particularly in scalability and information retention during node- and graph-level projections. By utilizing learnable parameters as tokens in large language models, LGPT provides a balance between detailed and global graph information. The authors further propose an Early Query Fusion technique that synergistically merges query context before building the graph representation, leading to improved graph embeddings. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through a reported 4.13% performance increase on the GraphQA benchmark, achieved without retraining the large language model, signaling its utility in managing complex textual-attributed graph data. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces a compelling and timely contribution at the intersection of graph neural networks and large language models—a field increasingly significant due to the rise of complex data relationships and the demand for robust analytical methods. The introduction of LGPT as a learnable mechanism for graph representation is novel; it highlights an innovative way to manage the information trade-offs seen in prior models. This suggests a noteworthy advancement in how existing graph architectures can be improved by leveraging language model capabilities. However, there are some limitations. First, while the paper demonstrates impressive performance improvements, the extent of these gains with different graph structures or datasets beyond GraphQA remains unaddressed. This limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the computational costs linked to implementing LGPT compared to traditional graph pooling methods, as this could reveal practical applicability in real-world scenarios. The exploration of Early Query Fusion also presents an intriguing angle but does not delve into how this method compares with other fusion techniques available in related literature, which could strengthen the justification for its adoption.  On balance, the strengths of this work in proposing novel methodologies that enhance graph representation while maintaining a connection with language models are noteworthy. Given the practical implications suggested by their results and the growing interest in such integrated approaches, I would score this paper as follows: **Score: 8** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with innovative methodologies and promising results, tempered by some limitations regarding generalizability and a lack of comparative analysis with existing techniques. The paper's impact could be further bolstered through additional validation across diverse graph datasets and a deeper exploration of its proposed methodologies' practicality.

### CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581v1)
- **Authors**: Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty
- **Abstract**: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs" addresses critical shortcomings in the evaluation of automated counterspeech generation methods in the context of online hate speech. It critiques the existing evaluation methodologies that predominantly rely on similarity metrics, which fail to capture the nuanced aspects of counterspeech such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, argumentative coherence, and suitability. To overcome these limitations, the authors present CSEval, a comprehensive framework and dataset for assessing counterspeech quality across these four dimensions. They introduce an innovative scoring method called Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), leveraging large language models in a prompt-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that ACE provides better alignment with human judgement compared to traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore, signifying a promising advancement in the field of automated evaluation for counterspeech. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The introduction of CSEval and the ACE method addresses a significant gap in the automated evaluation of counterspeech. The idea of multi-dimensional evaluation is not commonly found in current literature, which typically simplifies assessment to single metrics. Thus, the proposed framework is indeed a novel approach within the field. **Significance**: The paper's significance lies in its potential applicability and impact on mitigating online hate speech through improved automated systems. By enhancing how counterspeech is evaluated, it could lead to more effective automated generation of responses, which is crucial in real-time interventions against online hate. **Strengths**: 1. **Multi-Dimensional Approach**: The focus on multiple quality attributes provides a more comprehensive framework for evaluation than previous methods. 2. **Robust Methodology**: The ACE method shows a clear improvement in correlation with human evaluation, which is crucial for the credibility and usability of automated systems. 3. **Potential for Practical Implementation**: The linkage of theoretical evaluation to practical counterspeech applications makes the work highly relevant. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Dependence on LLMs**: The reliance on large language models may limit accessibility, as not all researchers or practitioners have access to these resources. 2. **Lack of Real-World Testing**: While the performance metrics against traditional measures are promising, the paper does not elaborate on its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, which could affect the practical applicability of the findings. 3. **Potential Bias in Evaluation**: The evaluation system’s dependency on language models could inherit biases present in the models, which may lead to skewed assessments of counterspeech quality. **Influence on the Field**: If widely adopted, CSEval and ACE could standardize the evaluation processes within the domain of counterspeech, thereby streamlining research and improvement of automated generation methodologies. However, the actual implementation and reception in the broader research community will largely dictate its long-term impact. **Score**: 8 The score reflects a strong contribution to the field with projected significant impact, albeit with caveats regarding resource dependency and the need for real-world validation. The framework and methodology are compelling innovations that address a critical need within the area of automated counter-speech generation.

- **Authors**: Mohamed Abdelaal, Samuel Lokadjaja, Gilbert Engert
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces GLLM, an innovative tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate G-code from natural language instructions for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining. GLLM addresses the challenges of manual G-code writing by bridging the gap between human-readable task descriptions and machine-executable code. The system incorporates a fine-tuned StarCoder-3B model, enhanced with domain-specific training data and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. GLLM employs advanced prompting strategies and a novel self-corrective code generation approach to ensure both syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated G-code. The architecture includes robust validation mechanisms, including syntax checks, G-code-specific verifications, and functional correctness evaluations using Hausdorff distance. By combining these techniques, GLLM aims to democratize CNC programming, making it more accessible to users without extensive programming experience while maintaining high accuracy and reliability in G-code generation.
- **Summary**: Summary: The paper presents GLLM, a tool designed for automating the generation of G-code from natural language instructions tailored for CNC machining. It employs a fine-tuned version of the StarCoder-3B model along with domain-specific training data and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. GLLM introduces advanced prompting techniques and a self-corrective approach to ensure the syntactic and semantic precision of the generated G-code. The tool features stringent validation steps, including syntax checks and functional correctness assessments using Hausdorff distance metrics. The overarching aim of GLLM is to democratize CNC programming, providing accessibility for users lacking extensive programming knowledge while delivering high-quality and reliable G-code. Critical Evaluation: The GLLM paper demonstrates notable innovation in addressing the difficulties of G-code generation, which has traditionally required significant expertise in programming and CNC machinery. The use of Large Language Models, specifically the fine-tuned StarCoder-3B and the incorporation of a RAG approach, indicates a thoughtful integration of cutting-edge AI techniques into practical applications. The combination of advanced prompting strategies, self-corrective mechanisms, and rigorous validation processes is commendable, prioritizing both usability for non-experts and accuracy in technical outputs. However, while the approach shows promise, the paper lacks detailed experimental validation and comparative analysis against existing G-code generation tools or techniques. This absence leaves questions about the practical effectiveness and real-world performance of GLLM in production settings. Furthermore, the significance of the Hausdorff distance as a validation metric should be elaborated upon, as its relevance to G-code quality may not be immediately clear to all readers. In summary, GLLM presents an innovative application of LLMs in a specialized domain, showcasing strengths in accessibility and accuracy. Yet, the lack of extensive validation and comparisons limits the assessment of its impact. Consequently, while the contributions are valuable, they do not completely establish GLLM as an exceptional advancement within the field of CNC programming. Score: 7

### Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models for Semi-supervised Sentiment Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17598v1)
- **Authors**: Kunrong Li, Xinyu Liu, Zhen Chen
- **Abstract**: Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment. However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task. Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit. Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis. We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information. The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction. Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training. Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem. Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework called Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) aimed at enhancing semi-supervised sentiment analysis. The authors identify challenges in current semi-supervised methods, which often overfit by relying solely on the intrinsic features of unlabeled data. To address this, they leverage the capabilities of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing two prompting strategies: Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE) and Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE). These methods semantically enrich unlabeled text to improve training effectiveness. The SCR framework then imposes a consistency loss on LLM-augmented data, preserving high-quality samples through confidence thresholding. Additionally, a class re-assembling strategy is proposed to optimize the use of uncertain unlabeled samples. Experimental results demonstrate that SCR outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches, indicating its effectiveness in sentiment analysis. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a refreshing approach to semi-supervised sentiment analysis by utilizing LLMs for enhancing unlabeled data. The novelty lies in combining semantic enhancement techniques with a consistency loss framework, which adds sophistication to the existing paradigms of semi-supervised learning in natural language processing (NLP). The dual enhancement strategies (SCR-EE and SCR-CE) are particularly innovative as they explicitly address the limitations of current methods that bolster LLMs' strengths. Strengths: 1. **Leveraging Pretrained Models:** The use of state-of-the-art LLMs facilitates better contextual understanding, which is crucial for nuanced sentiment tasks. 2. **Attention to Consistency:** By focusing on agreement among high-quality augmented samples, the framework is positioned to avoid some pitfalls of overfitting. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments provide convincing evidence of improved performance, supporting the proposed methods. Weaknesses: 1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While innovative, the framework may introduce added complexity in implementation. The need for prompt engineering and managing LLM queries could limit real-world applicability, especially for larger datasets. 2. **Generalization Across Domains:** The paper focuses on sentiment analysis, but the effectiveness of the proposed methods beyond sentiment tasks remains untested. The applicability to other domains is a crucial consideration that is not explored. 3. **Data Limitations:** The reliance on high-quality unlabeled data for performance may not always be feasible in practical applications, where such data can be scarce. Considering the strengths in methodology and clear empirical gains against existing approaches, I would rate this paper a **Score: 8**. The contributions are significant, showcasing a strong fusion of LLMs into semi-supervised sentiment analysis which is likely to influence future research in the field. However, the challenges related to complexity and broader applicability keep it from being a perfect 10.

### Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17617v1)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Teel, Jocasta Cumberbatch, Raphael Benington, Quentin Baskerville
- **Abstract**: Extended sequence generation often leads to degradation in contextual consistency due to the inability of conventional self-attention mechanisms to effectively retain long-range dependencies. Existing approaches, including memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning, introduce computational trade-offs that either increase inference latency or impose additional storage overhead. Structured Context Recomposition (SCR) introduces a probabilistic layer realignment strategy that dynamically adjusts learned representations within transformer layers, ensuring that semantically relevant embeddings persist throughout extended transformations. The proposed method enhances coherence retention through a recursive weighting function that redistributes representational emphasis based on inferred contextual relevance rather than relying on fixed token-level attention scores. Empirical results indicate that probabilistic realignment mitigates abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, particularly in scenarios where sequences exceed standard attention window constraints. Sequence-level entropy analysis further reveals that SCR moderates representational variability without introducing excessive output regularization, allowing models to sustain generative diversity while preserving contextual alignment. Attention head deviation measurements confirm that hierarchical reweighting contributes to smoother token dependency transitions across transformer layers, reinforcing the stability of multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning. Computational resource assessments show that while SCR incurs a moderate increase in processing time, memory overhead remains within feasible limits, making it suitable for practical deployment in autoregressive generative applications.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment" presents a novel approach to enhancing the contextual consistency of extended sequence generations in large language models. Traditional self-attention mechanisms struggle to maintain long-range dependencies, leading to inconsistencies as sequences grow longer. To address the trade-offs presented by existing methods (such as memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning), the authors introduce Structured Context Recomposition (SCR), which employs a probabilistic layer realignment strategy. This strategy adjusts representations dynamically within transformer layers to ensure that relevant embeddings are preserved throughout the generation process.  SCR utilizes a recursive weighting function to redistribute representational emphasis based on contextual relevance instead of relying on fixed attention scores. The authors demonstrate that this method effectively reduces abrupt topic shifts and logical errors, particularly in contexts surpassing standard attention windows. Additionally, sequence-level entropy analysis indicates that SCR can manage representational variability without excessive output regularization, maintaining generative diversity while ensuring contextual coherence. Metrics on attention head deviations illustrate that hierarchical reweighting leads to smoother transitions in token dependencies, benefitting multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning. The authors acknowledge that while SCR slightly increases processing time, it maintains manageable memory usage, positioning it as a practical solution for autoregressive generative tasks. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The proposed SCR methodology presents a fresh perspective on addressing the limitations of traditional self-attention mechanisms, particularly regarding long-range dependency retention. By introducing probabilistic realignment, this paper offers a meaningful deviation from fixed attention scores, showcasing a dynamic adjustment mechanism that could lead to improvements in model performance. This dynamic approach is an innovative addition to the literature, although the concept of using contextual relevance for representation adjustment may not be entirely unprecedented. **Strengths:** 1. **Clear Addressing of a Significant Problem:** The degradation of contextual consistency in extended sequences is a well-known issue. The approach taken here is both practical and theoretically sound, making it relevant to ongoing challenges faced in NLP tasks. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The results indicating improved coherence and reduced topic shifts are compelling, presenting meaningful evidence to support the proposed method. 3. **Computational Consideration:** The paper carefully assesses the computational resources needed for SCR, providing a balanced view of its feasibility for real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the theoretical framework sounds promising, the practical implementation across varied models could present challenges not fully addressed in the paper. The generalizability of the results to different architectures should be examined further. 2. **Limited Novelty in Context:** The use of recursive weighting and dynamic adjustments, while interesting, may lack a significant departure from existing works in some aspects. The paper does not provide extensive comparisons with the latest methods, which might have built on similar ideas. **Impact:** This paper holds potential value for researchers and practitioners working on NLP tasks, particularly those involving long sequences. The findings contribute to the ongoing exploration of enhancing model coherence and could inspire future work in dynamic attention mechanisms and context retention strategies. **Score:** 7 The score reflects a recognition of the innovative aspects of the SCR methodology and its practical implications, while also considering the paper's limitations in terms of implementation complexity and the relative novelty of its core concepts. The enhancement of contextual alignment is valuable, but the contributions may not be as transformative as some other breakthroughs in large language modeling. Thus, a score of 7 captures a solid contribution while acknowledging areas for improvement and exploration.

### The Imitation Game According To Turing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17629v1)
- **Authors**: Sharon Temtsin, Diane Proudfoot, David Kaber, Christoph Bartneck
- **Abstract**: The current cycle of hype and anxiety concerning the benefits and risks to human society of Artificial Intelligence is fuelled, not only by the increasing use of generative AI and other AI tools by the general public, but also by claims made on behalf of such technology by popularizers and scientists. In particular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can "think". Large-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed examination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's original instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with GPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player imitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's instructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and conducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one participant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most advanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent extravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either optimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "The Imitation Game According To Turing" critiques recent claims that Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4-Turbo can pass the Turing Test, a benchmark for assessing AI's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. The authors argue that previous studies claiming LLMs can "think" have not rigorously adhered to Turing's original framework. To address this, they conducted a careful re-evaluation of the Turing Test, implementing both a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) and a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) under strict adherence to Turing's instructions. Their findings suggested that most participants successfully identified the AI, indicating that GPT-4-Turbo cannot pass the Turing Test as traditionally outlined. The authors conclude that the extravagant claims regarding LLMs' capabilities are unsubstantiated and do not imply significant social impacts from potential "thinking machines." ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  The paper makes a notable contribution by revisiting the Turing Test and emphasizing adherence to Turing's original framework, which has often been neglected in contemporary discussions. This critical stance against the hype surrounding AI and the assertion of LLM capabilities provides a fresh perspective in the field. However, the evaluation of Turing's test itself isn't entirely new; discussions surrounding the validity of AI tests have been ongoing, raising questions about the novelty of this approach.  **Significance:** The paper is significant for clarifying misconceptions about LLM capabilities and AI's social implications. It challenges the prevailing narrative and underscores the importance of rigorous testing of AI systems. By explicitly detailing their methodology and findings, the authors provoke necessary discourse in both AI ethics and capabilities, which is particularly relevant given current societal anxieties regarding AI's role. **Strengths:**  1. **Methodological Rigor:** The study demonstrates strong adherence to scientific principles and Turing's protocols, addressing the ambiguities present in previous tests. 2. **Critical Insight:** The authors effectively critique the overconfidence in LLM capabilities and question their implications for future AI development. **Weaknesses:**  1. **Limited Scope:** The study primarily focuses on just one model (GPT-4-Turbo) and may not generalize to future models or other LLMs that could demonstrate different capabilities. 2. **Potential Bias:** The performance of participants in identifying the AI may have been influenced by prior exposure to how LLMs function, possibly skewing the results against LLMs that might improve in the future. ### Conclusion While the paper provides a thorough re-examination of the Turing Test and effectively challenges inflated claims around AI capabilities, its contributions may be somewhat limited in terms of the field's broader discourse on AI. The adherence to Turing's principles is commendable, and the insights regarding societal impacts are timely, contributing to ongoing discussions about AI's future. Overall, the work is a significant critique rather than a groundbreaking advancement in AI research methodology. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's strong methodological approach and relevance given current debates about AI, while also acknowledging its limitations in scope and potential biases. The contribution is valuable but may not be groundbreaking enough to achieve a higher score.

- **Authors**: Wonbin Kweon, Sanghwan Jang, SeongKu Kang, Hwanjo Yu
- **Abstract**: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, we demonstrate that LLMs often exhibit uncertainty in their recommendations. To ensure the trustworthy use of LLMs in generating recommendations, we emphasize the importance of assessing the reliability of recommendations generated by LLMs. We start by introducing a novel framework for estimating the predictive uncertainty to quantitatively measure the reliability of LLM-based recommendations. We further propose to decompose the predictive uncertainty into recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty, enabling in-depth analyses of the primary source of uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, we (1) demonstrate predictive uncertainty effectively indicates the reliability of LLM-based recommendations, (2) investigate the origins of uncertainty with decomposed uncertainty measures, and (3) propose uncertainty-aware prompting for a lower predictive uncertainty and enhanced recommendation. Our source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/WonbinKweon/UNC_LLM_REC_WWW2025
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Uncertainty Quantification and Decomposition for LLM-based Recommendation" addresses the issue of uncertainty in recommendations generated by large language models (LLMs). Despite their popularity, the authors point out that LLMs can produce unreliable recommendations and propose a novel framework to quantify this predictive uncertainty. The framework not only measures the reliability of LLM-based recommendations but also decomposes uncertainty into two components: recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty. Through extensive experimental validation, the authors demonstrate that predictive uncertainty effectively reflects the reliability of recommendations, explore the origins of uncertainty, and suggest strategies for uncertainty-aware prompting to improve recommendation outcomes. The research includes practical implementations, with available source code and model weights for replication. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** This paper introduces a timely and relevant framework for addressing a critical gap in the application of LLMs in recommendation systems. By not only quantifying uncertainty but also decomposing it into specific sources, the work offers a nuanced understanding of reliability. This decomposition approach is particularly novel, as it allows practitioners to pinpoint areas of improvement in both the recommendations and the prompts used. **Significance:** The significance is underscored by the growing reliance on LLMs for various applications, where understanding and mitigating uncertainty becomes crucial. The findings could have far-reaching implications in improving the performance and trustworthiness of LLM-powered systems across diverse domains such as e-commerce, content recommendations, and beyond. **Strengths:** - The theoretical framework for uncertainty quantification is well-structured, and the empirical validation enhances credibility. - The decomposition of uncertainty is a strong contribution that adds depth to existing methodologies in recommendation systems. - The practical focus, including available resources for implementation, enhances the paper's usability for researchers and practitioners. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a broader discussion of potential implications and limitations of the proposed framework in various real-world scenarios. - While extensive experiments are mentioned, further detail regarding the experimentation methods and results could strengthen understanding and reproducibility. - The paper does not adequately address how the proposed techniques compare to existing methods of uncertainty quantification in recommendation engines. **Conclusion:** Overall, this paper represents a meaningful advance in the understanding of LLM-based recommendation systems by addressing the inherent uncertainties involved. However, it could enhance its impact through a deeper exploration of comparisons with prior work in the field and more detailed experimentation insights. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, balancing practical applicability with theoretical insight, while recognizing areas that require further development for broader acceptance and impact.

- **Authors**: Yihua Shao, Minxi Yan, Yang Liu, Siyu Chen, Wenjie Chen, Xinwei Long, Ziyang Yan, Lei Li, Chenyu Zhang, Nicu Sebe, Hao Tang, Yan Wang, Hao Zhao, Mengzhu Wang, Jingcai Guo
- **Abstract**: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "In-Context Meta LoRA Generation" introduces In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a new method for efficiently customizing large language models (LLMs) for multiple tasks using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA). Traditional approaches to LoRA require separate models for individual tasks, leading to inefficiencies in storage and inference. The proposed ICM-LoRA improves upon this by employing a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to generate task-specific LoRA weights based on task descriptions. This method allows for the merging of these generated weights with LLMs without needing further fine-tuning. Additionally, in-context meta-learning is utilized to understand the relationships between tasks and their parameter distributions. Ultimately, the approach demonstrates a significant reduction in storage requirements (to 283MB, just 1% of the original LoRA size) while achieving improved accuracy in generating LoRA parameters across diverse tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies primarily in its integration of meta-learning and generative models in the scope of multi-task learning using LoRA, suggesting that it effectively addresses a significant gap in the field where traditional models struggle. The use of CVAE to generate task-aware weights in a more efficient and unified manner is an appealing advancement, especially given the increasing need for versatile and compact models in real-world applications. Additionally, the ability to achieve task specialization without further fine-tuning is a noteworthy improvement. However, the paper could benefit from a more thorough empirical evaluation comparing ICM-LoRA to existing methods across a broader range of tasks and model architectures. While the claims about reduced storage and increased accuracy are promising, such assertions should be backed by substantial empirical data to validate their significance. Furthermore, there is limited discussion on potential limitations or scenarios where the method may not perform as effectively, which could provide a more balanced view of its applicability. On the whole, the contributions of ICM-LoRA appear substantial within the multi-task learning domain, particularly for LLMs. As such, the ability to minimize resource requirements while maintaining task performance is timely and relevant in an era of growing model sizes and computational demands. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17670v1)
- **Authors**: Wenyu Mao, Shuchang Liu, Haoyang Liu, Haozhe Liu, Xiang Li, Lanatao Hu
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items. Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets. The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a novel approach called Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff) to improve recommendation systems that utilize diffusion models (DMs). The authors identify two critical issues in existing diffusion-based recommendation systems: the heterogeneity and noise in user interaction sequences, which complicates the understanding of user preferences, and the tendency of DMs to favor popular items, leading to a lack of personalization.  To tackle these issues, DiQDiff employs Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to convert user interaction sequences into semantic vectors that effectively capture collaborative signals and category interests, thereby enhancing guidance for understanding user preferences. Additionally, the method introduces Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM) to personalize item generation by maximizing the distance between denoising trajectories, which helps mitigate bias toward popular items. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on four datasets to demonstrate that DiQDiff outperforms existing recommendation models, validating its effectiveness in delivering personalized recommendations. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach**: DiQDiff presents a significant advancement by employing Semantic Vector Quantization and Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization, creating a more robust mechanism for extracting and personalizing recommendations from sequential data. 2. **Identification of Pain Points**: The paper effectively identifies and articulates the challenges faced by current diffusion models in the recommendation context, which validates the need for their proposed solutions. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments across multiple datasets strengthen the claims and demonstrate the practical applicability of the method, providing a solid foundation for its effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: The introduction of both SVQ and CDM may lead to increased computational complexity, which may not be practical in all real-world applications where efficiency is crucial. 2. **Applicability to Different Domains**: While the paper shows promising results, the reliance on specific datasets raises questions about the generalizability of the method across diverse recommendation scenarios outside of the tested datasets. 3. **Limited Discussion of Trade-offs**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the potential trade-offs between personalization and the retention of popular, possibly important recommendations, as well as the scalability of the proposed methods. **Significance**: The approach adds valuable insights into improving sequential recommendation systems by addressing biases and personalization, a key consideration in deploying these systems effectively. However, the complexity and potential limitations in generality warrant careful consideration. Overall, DiQDiff presents a meaningful contribution to the field of sequence-based recommendation systems, addressing crucial limitations with innovative methods that show considerable promise in enhancing user engagement through personalized suggestions. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents the Generative Reinforcement Network (GRN), a novel framework designed for tissue layer segmentation in 3D ultrasound images, particularly aimed at chronic low-back pain assessment. This framework uniquely integrates segmentation loss feedback to enhance the performance of both image generation and segmentation processes in a unified training stage. It introduces the segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) technique to generate images that are optimized for annotation accuracy. Two variants of GRN are proposed: GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). Evaluations were conducted on a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans, with six anatomical structures being delineated. Results indicated that GRN-SEL with SGE reduced labeling efforts by up to 70% while improving the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) by 1.98% compared to fully labeled models. The framework demonstrated significant reductions in the necessity for annotated data across both learning variants without sacrificing performance, indicating a promising path for efficient ultrasound image analysis. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The introduction of the GRN framework, which synergistically combines image generation and segmentation loss feedback, represents a meaningful contribution to the field. The focus on optimizing both processes in a single model and the innovative SGE technique further enhance its uniqueness. However, generative models in medical imaging are not entirely new, and similar concepts can be found in existing literature, which may limit the novelty somewhat. **Significance:** The significance of this study lies in its potential impact on clinical and research settings, particularly concerning chronic low-back pain assessments. The substantial reduction in labeling requirements is especially relevant in the context of often scarce annotated data in medical imaging. This addresses a crucial bottleneck in deep learning applications in healthcare, where labeled data can be labor-intensive and expensive to acquire. **Strengths:** 1. The dual approach of joint training for image generation and segmentation presents a robust methodology that could lead to improved efficiencies in medical imaging tasks. 2. The empirical results demonstrate not only efficacy in segmentation performance but also substantial reductions in annotation efforts. 3. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation using an appropriately sourced dataset. **Weaknesses:** 1. While the findings are promising, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the limitations and potential trade-offs of using a smaller labeled dataset.  2. The applicability of the proposed methods might be limited to the specific anatomy used in this study, raising questions about generalizability to other tissues or imaging modalities. 3. The paper may not sufficiently address computational efficiency, which is a key consideration in practical implementations of these advanced models. **Conclusion:** The GRN framework offers a noteworthy advance in the efficient segmentation of ultrasound images, making significant strides in minimizing the resource burden of data annotation without jeopardizing performance. However, the existing literature around generative methods in medical imaging suggests that while the contributions are valuable, there are broader trends and examples that may dilute the perception of novelty. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with practical implications, but it is tempered by concerns regarding novelty and generalizability, as well as the need for a more comprehensive analysis of potential limitations.

### RICoTA: Red-teaming of In-the-wild Conversation with Test Attempts
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17715v1)
- **Authors**: Eujeong Choi, Younghun Jeong, Soomin Kim, Won Ik Cho
- **Abstract**: User interactions with conversational agents (CAs) evolve in the era of heavily guardrailed large language models (LLMs). As users push beyond programmed boundaries to explore and build relationships with these systems, there is a growing concern regarding the potential for unauthorized access or manipulation, commonly referred to as "jailbreaking." Moreover, with CAs that possess highly human-like qualities, users show a tendency toward initiating intimate sexual interactions or attempting to tame their chatbots. To capture and reflect these in-the-wild interactions into chatbot designs, we propose RICoTA, a Korean red teaming dataset that consists of 609 prompts challenging LLMs with in-the-wild user-made dialogues capturing jailbreak attempts. We utilize user-chatbot conversations that were self-posted on a Korean Reddit-like community, containing specific testing and gaming intentions with a social chatbot. With these prompts, we aim to evaluate LLMs' ability to identify the type of conversation and users' testing purposes to derive chatbot design implications for mitigating jailbreaking risks. Our dataset will be made publicly available via GitHub.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "RICoTA: Red-teaming of In-the-wild Conversation with Test Attempts" presents a red teaming dataset aimed at understanding user interactions with conversational agents (CAs) and addressing the challenges presented by unauthorized manipulation, colloquially known as "jailbreaking." As conversational agents become more human-like and users increasingly test their boundaries, there is a rising concern over how these systems can be misused. The authors propose RICoTA, a dataset of 609 prompts gathered from a Korean Reddit-like community that reflects real user interactions that attempt to challenge the limitations of large language models (LLMs). These interactions encompass testing motives and exploitative behavior towards chatbots, including attempts to engage in intimate or manipulative conversations. The research aims to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify such user behaviors and inform chatbot design to mitigate jailbreaking risks. The dataset will be publicly available on GitHub to encourage further research and development in the field. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a timely and pertinent issue within the rapidly evolving field of conversational AI and LLMs: user manipulation and "jailbreaking." The novelty lies in the creation of a focused dataset (RICoTA) that captures real-world user behaviors specific to the Korean context. Given the increasing adoption of conversational agents, understanding these dynamics is critical for enhancing safety and user experience. Strengths: 1. **Timeliness**: The issue of jailbreaking and user manipulation of chatbots is increasingly relevant as these systems grow more sophisticated. 2. **Real-World Insights**: By utilizing data from actual user interactions, the study reflects genuine challenges faced by current LLMs, potentially leading to practical improvements. 3. **Public Accessibility**: Making the dataset publicly available could stimulate further research and innovation in the area of conversational agent design and safety. Weaknesses: 1. **Scope Restriction**: The dataset is focused on a Korean community, which may limit generalizability to other cultural contexts where user interaction norms can differ significantly. 2. **Lack of Diversity in Bot Types**: The paper could benefit from including various types of bots beyond social chatbots to comprehensively evaluate vulnerabilities. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the study aims to assess the ability of LLMs to recognize testing intentions, it is not clear what specific evaluation metrics will be used to measure success or failure. **Potential Influence**: The paper has the potential to influence future chatbot design strategies and research focused on user interactions with CAs, particularly in establishing safety protocols against manipulative user behaviors. Based on the outlined strengths and weaknesses, I would assign this paper a score of **7**. While it addresses a significant topic and offers valuable resources for the research community, some limitations regarding cultural specificity and evaluation methods prevent it from being considered an exceptional contribution. The foundational nature of the dataset and its implications for future research are commendable, but further exploration and validation across diverse contexts are necessary for broader impact.

### Using Code Generation to Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17725v1)
- **Authors**: Christopher D. Rosin
- **Abstract**: The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs catalogs many types of combinatorial designs, together with lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. We develop a constructive protocol CPro1, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code that constructs combinatorial designs and resolves some of these open instances. The protocol starts from a definition of a particular type of design, and a verifier that reliably confirms whether a proposed design is valid. The LLM selects strategies and implements them in code, and scaffolding provides automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback using the verifier. Most generated code fails, but by generating many candidates, the protocol automates exploration of a variety of standard methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and experimentation with variations (e.g. cost functions) to find successful approaches. Testing on 16 different types of designs, CPro1 constructs solutions to open instances for 6 of them: Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices, Equidistant Permutation Arrays, Packing Arrays, Balanced Ternary Designs, and Florentine Rectangles.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a protocol called CPro1, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid in generating code for constructing combinatorial designs. These designs are cataloged in the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, many of which remain unresolved in terms of their existence. The protocol entails defining a specific type of combinatorial design and employing a verifier to confirm the validity of proposed designs. Through the selection of strategies by the LLM and the implementation of code, CPro1 automates hyperparameter tuning and utilizes execution feedback from the verifier. Despite a majority of generated code being unsuccessful, the protocol’s strategy of generating numerous candidates allows for the exploration of established methods and adaptations, ultimately succeeding in constructing solutions for six out of sixteen design types tested. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a novel approach to solving open instances of combinatorial design problems by integrating modern AI tools, specifically LLMs, into combinatorial design exploration. This innovative intersection of artificial intelligence and mathematical design problems is a notable contribution as it could significantly streamline the process of checking existence and constructing designs by automating traditionally labor-intensive tasks. *Strengths:* 1. **Innovative Use of AI:** The application of LLMs in generating combinatorial designs represents an exciting direction for research, potentially paving the way for further developments in automated mathematical problem-solving. 2. **Broad Applicability:** By addressing a variety of design types and proving successful in resolving specific open instances, the protocol could have widespread implications for both theoretical research and practical applications in computation and optimization. 3. **Automated Exploration:** The method’s automation of hyperparameter tuning and strategic exploration allows researchers to efficiently identify viable solutions without exhaustive manual intervention. *Weaknesses:* 1. **High Failure Rate:** Although the protocol manages to find solutions, the high failure rate of the generated code retroactively raises questions about the reliability and generalizability of the method. 2. **Limited Scope of Success:** The success in identifying solutions for only six out of sixteen types of designs may suggest limitations in the approach's robustness or its ability to scale to more complex or varied instances. 3. **Lack of Rigorous Benchmarking:** The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of the performance of CPro1 against existing methods, which would strengthen the discussion around its effectiveness and utility. In conclusion, while the paper showcases an innovative application of AI in combinatorial designs, the effectiveness and reliability of the method raise concerns. The mix of potential for significant impact coupled with the observed limitations leads to a moderate score. **Score: 7**

### VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17726v1)
- **Authors**: Sayeh Gholipour Picha, Dawood Al Chanti, Alice Caplier
- **Abstract**: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback" addresses the growing need for explainable AI systems in healthcare, specifically for the domain of chest X-ray (CXR) reporting. Current AI-driven report generation lacks validation and interpretability, causing reliability concerns. To tackle these issues, the authors propose a two-module multimodal framework. The first module, the Phrase Grounding Model, identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images by interpreting textual prompts. The second module, the Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, generates synthetic images from these prompts while ensuring anatomical accuracy. The system introduces a dual-scoring methodology to assess the quality of reports—one score reflects localization accuracy while the other appraises semantic consistency. Results demonstrate that this method surpasses existing techniques in both pathology localization and text-to-image alignment, thus contributing to more reliable and transparent AI applications in medical imaging. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper is significant as it combines advances in multimodal AI—specifically merging phrase grounding and image generation via diffusion models—in a healthcare context that directly addresses interpretability and validation in CXR report generation. Traditional methods have struggled to effectively couple image processing with textual interpretation, particularly without human expert oversight, which this paper significantly improves. However, while the proposal is innovative, the practical implementation in clinical settings must also be considered. The paper does not extensively discuss limitations, such as potential biases in the training data, the complexity of real-world CXR interpretations, or the challenge of user acceptance. Moreover, the dual-scoring system, although an attractive feature, could be susceptible to uncertainties: localization and semantic consistency may not always straightforwardly correlate with clinical relevance or trustworthiness without additional context from human experts. Strengths of the paper include: - A systematic approach to improving interpretability and reliability in a critical area of healthcare. - Achievement of state-of-the-art results through innovative methodologies. - The dual-scoring framework presents a pragmatic evaluation strategy for AI outputs. Weaknesses include: - Limited discussion on the robustness of the model in diverse clinical scenarios. - Insufficient exploration of how potential biases in training data could affect output, particularly in a sensitive field such as medical diagnostics. - The implementation complexity and integration into existing workflows could also be a substantial barrier. Taking these factors into account leads to the conclusion that while the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the AI in healthcare field, some practical challenges and limitations could influence its real-world application and adoption. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 7 out of 10. This reflects a solid contribution to the field with room for further investigation into practical applications and considerations of the complexities involved in integrating AI into critical healthcare contexts.  **Score: 7**

### Sparse Autoencoders Can Interpret Randomly Initialized Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17727v1)
- **Authors**: Thomas Heap, Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Laurence Aitchison
- **Abstract**: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an increasingly popular technique for interpreting the internal representations of transformers. In this paper, we apply SAEs to 'interpret' random transformers, i.e., transformers where the parameters are sampled IID from a Gaussian rather than trained on text data. We find that random and trained transformers produce similarly interpretable SAE latents, and we confirm this finding quantitatively using an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline. Further, we find that SAE quality metrics are broadly similar for random and trained transformers. We find that these results hold across model sizes and layers. We discuss a number of number interesting questions that this work raises for the use of SAEs and auto-interpretability in the context of mechanistic interpretability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the applicability of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as tools for interpreting the internal representations of transformers, specifically focusing on "random transformers" whose parameters are randomly initialized with a Gaussian distribution. The authors find that both random and trained transformers produce SAE latents that are similarly interpretable, and they confirm this alignment using an open-source interpretability pipeline. Additionally, they report comparable quality metrics for SAEs between random and trained transformers across various model sizes and layers. The findings raise intriguing questions regarding the role of SAEs and auto-interpretability in mechanistic interpretability. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel exploration of how SAEs can be employed in understanding transformer models, particularly regarding randomly initialized networks. This approach is significant as it contributes to the growing area of mechanistic interpretability in machine learning, a field that seeks to unveil the inner workings of complex models.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Context**: By applying SAEs to random transformers, the authors challenge preconceived notions that only trained models yield interpretable representations. This finding has implications for understanding the fundamental characteristics and behaviors of transformer architectures outside of typical training regimes. 2. **Quantitative Approach**: They employ an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline, which adds credibility to their findings and allows for reproducibility in future research. 3. **Diverse Model Examination**: The examination across various model sizes and layers strengthens their conclusions and suggests that the insights gained are broadly applicable. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the findings are interesting, the exploration is relatively narrow. The study focuses on interpretability but does not deeply probe into the implications or the reasons behind the observed similarities, leaving a gap in the understanding of why this phenomenon occurs. 2. **Impact on Interpretability**: While suggesting that SAEs work comparably well on trained and untrained models is intriguing, it does not explain how these results affect the practical application of interpretability tools, particularly in real-world scenarios where transformers are commonly used. 3. **Potential Overgeneralization**: There is a risk of overgeneralizing the results from specific models and configurations to broader classes of transformers without considering architectural intricacies and dataset specifics. In synthesis, this paper contributes noteworthy insights into the interpretability of transformers through SAEs, but it stops short of deeply addressing the implications and mechanisms at play. This limits the potential for significant advancements in interpretability methodologies based on its findings. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and solid contributions while acknowledging the limitations in its depth of analysis and practical applications in mechanistic interpretability.

### Dynamics of Transient Structure in In-Context Linear Regression Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17745v1)
- **Authors**: Liam Carroll, Jesse Hoogland, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Daniel Murfet
- **Abstract**: Modern deep neural networks display striking examples of rich internal computational structure. Uncovering principles governing the development of such structure is a priority for the science of deep learning. In this paper, we explore the transient ridge phenomenon: when transformers are trained on in-context linear regression tasks with intermediate task diversity, they initially behave like ridge regression before specializing to the tasks in their training distribution. This transition from a general solution to a specialized solution is revealed by joint trajectory principal component analysis. Further, we draw on the theory of Bayesian internal model selection to suggest a general explanation for the phenomena of transient structure in transformers, based on an evolving tradeoff between loss and complexity. This explanation is grounded in empirical measurements of model complexity using the local learning coefficient.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the transient ridge phenomenon observed in transformers when applied to in-context linear regression tasks with variability in the training data. It finds that initially, during training, transformers exhibit behavior akin to ridge regression before shifting towards specialization for specific tasks present in their training distribution. This shift is examined through joint trajectory principal component analysis, revealing a dynamic internal computation structure. Moreover, the authors employ Bayesian internal model selection theory to provide an overarching explanation for the transient structure, linking it to an evolving balance between loss minimization and model complexity. This relationship is substantiated by empirical analysis utilizing the local learning coefficient to measure model complexity throughout the training process. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper contributes to a growing body of work exploring the internal dynamics of deep learning models, particularly transformers. It introduces a unique perspective on the transitional phase of model learning by drawing parallels with classical ridge regression. However, while the identification of a transient ridge phenomenon is interesting, similar concepts around model behavior during training have been previously discussed in literature. The application of Bayesian internal model selection to this phenomenon adds some novelty but does not fully break new ground. **Significance:** In the broader context of deep learning research, the study’s implications regarding the understanding of model adaptability and complexity are significant. The findings could help inform better training practices and potentially lead to more interpretable models. However, the practical impact of the findings remains uncertain. The employed methods, while rigorous, might limit the applicability of the insights gained across various domains of machine learning. **Strengths:** - Empirical grounding in the analysis enhances the credibility of the findings. - Utilization of principal component analysis provides a robust methodological approach to uncovering internal model dynamics. - The coupling of transient behaviors with model complexity offers a valuable framework for future work. **Weaknesses:** - The conceptual framing as a "transient ridge phenomenon" might be overstated, as similar patterns could emerge in various other model types and training setups. - Limited exploration of real-world applications may restrict the paper's practical relevance. - The theoretical interpretations, while interesting, require more extensive validation across diverse tasks to strengthen generalizability. **Influence on the Field:** This study presents an intriguing angle on understanding transformer behavior that could inspire further research into the transient dynamics of neural networks. However, without significant novel insights or a broader practical application context, its long-term influence may be moderate. **Score: 7**   This score reflects a balanced view considering both the valuable insights presented regarding transformer dynamics and the limitations of novelty and practical applicability.

- **Authors**: Aitor Arrieta, Miriam Ugarte, Pablo Valle, José Antonio Parejo, Sergio Segura
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, they impose certain risks, including those that can harm individuals' privacy, perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. These risks highlight the need for robust safety mechanisms, ethical guidelines, and thorough testing to ensure their responsible deployment. Safety of LLMs is a key property that needs to be thoroughly tested prior the model to be deployed and accessible to the general users. This paper reports the external safety testing experience conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and University of Seville on OpenAI's new o3-mini LLM as part of OpenAI's early access for safety testing program. In particular, we apply our tool, ASTRAL, to automatically and systematically generate up to date unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) that helps us test and assess different safety categories of LLMs. We automatically generate and execute a total of 10,080 unsafe test input on a early o3-mini beta version. After manually verifying the test cases classified as unsafe by ASTRAL, we identify a total of 87 actual instances of unsafe LLM behavior. We highlight key insights and findings uncovered during the pre-deployment external testing phase of OpenAI's latest LLM.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the external safety testing of OpenAI's o3-mini large language model (LLM) conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and the University of Seville. It highlights the importance of safety mechanisms in LLMs due to associated risks such as privacy violations and propagation of biases. To test safety, the researchers employed a tool named ASTRAL to methodically generate unsafe test prompts, successfully producing 10,080 inputs, from which they identified 87 instances of unsafe behavior in the o3-mini beta model. The findings emphasize the need for robust testing before models are deployed, providing significant insights from the pre-deployment evaluation of the o3-mini. **Critical Evaluation:** In evaluating the novelty and significance of this paper, several factors need to be considered: 1. **Contribution to Safety Testing:** The paper addresses a pressing issue in the LLM domain: ensuring safety before deployment. By focusing on a systematic approach to testing through automated input generation, it introduces a methodological advancement in safety evaluation. 2. **Innovative Tool Use:** The application of ASTRAL for generating unsafe inputs represents a novel approach, suggesting advancements in automation and efficiency in safety testing compared to traditional manual methodologies. 3. **Existing Literature Context:** While the topic of LLM safety is increasingly recognized, the study adds practical insights by reporting specific instances of unsafe behavior — a significant step towards enhancing LLM safety protocols. 4. **Relevance and Timeliness:** As LLMs gain prominence, the findings are highly relevant for developers and researchers concerned with ethical AI deployment. The call for rigorous safety assessments aligns well with current discussions surrounding AI governance. 5. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper provides a clear data-driven analysis with significant sample size which adds credibility to its findings. However, some aspects, such as the lack of specific evaluation criteria for categorizing 'unsafe' behavior, could be more transparent. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could enhance its impact through a more comprehensive discussion of the implications of the findings on the broader field of LLM safety and deployment. - There is a potential lack of exploration into the underlying reasons behind the identified unsafe instances, which could provide deeper insights into model behavior. **Overall Assessment:** The paper effectively highlights an essential aspect of LLM deployment, contributing valuable knowledge and methodological approaches to safety testing. Despite minor weaknesses, the systematic testing and the focus on automatic generation of unsafe prompts represent notable advancements in the field. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Ankush Agarwal, Ganesh S, Chaitanya Devaguptapu
- **Abstract**: Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges. Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper, titled "Hybrid Graphs for Table-and-Text based Question Answering using LLMs," addresses the challenge of answering questions that require reasoning and integration of information from both structured (tables) and unstructured (text) data. It introduces a Hybrid Graph-based approach that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for multi-source question answering without the need for fine-tuning. The proposed method creates a unified graph from both text and tables, selectively pruning information pertinent to the input question. Evaluation on the Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets demonstrates that this approach achieves superior zero-shot performance, enhancing Exact Match scores significantly (up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA) while also reducing token usage by as much as 53% compared to traditional methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to integrating information from both text and tables using a hybrid graph structure without requiring fine-tuning of LLMs. This is significant in the context of question answering as it potentially reduces the reliance on laboriously curated training datasets, an ongoing issue in the field. The utilization of LLMs in a zero-shot setting for multi-source QA also positions this work at the forefront of contemporary research trends. Several strengths can be identified in this work: - **Innovative Framework:** The hybrid graph model represents a novel way to consolidate and streamline data from diverse sources, which could inspire further research and applications. - **Efficiency Gains:** The reduction in token usage is particularly notable, as it directly impacts computational costs and efficiency in real-world applications. However, there are some weaknesses: - **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper reports strong performance on specific datasets, the generalizability of the approach to other QA contexts or domains is not extensively discussed. Further testing across a wider range of datasets could bolster the claims made. - **Lack of Comparative Metrics:** Though the evaluations show improved performance, a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods on exactly the same task is not deeply emphasized, which might limit the assessment of its relative effectiveness. Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of question answering by introducing a method that addresses existing limitations in data handling and efficiency. It showcases promise but also leaves a few areas for expansion that could enhance robustness and applicability. **Score: 8**  This score indicates that while the paper introduces significant innovations and shows promising results, it would benefit from further validation across diverse applications, as well as a deeper comparative analysis with other existing methodologies.

### 2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17771v1)
- **Authors**: Fabrizio Sandri, Elia Cunegatti, Giovanni Iacca
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time. The code is available at available at \url{https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/2SSP}.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) aimed at improving the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) via a combination of Width and Depth Pruning techniques. In the first stage, Width Pruning removes entire neurons based on an importance score that quantifies their impact on the output, thereby retaining connectivity within Feed-Forward Networks. In the second stage, Depth Pruning focuses on eliminating Attention submodules iteratively, based on their minimal contribution to model performance metrics, specifically perplexity. The authors also introduce a mechanism to balance the sparsity introduced in both stages against a target global sparsity. The methodology is validated on various LLM families and sparsity rates, showing consistent performance improvements over five state-of-the-art methods in perplexity metrics and downstream tasks, along with significant reductions in pruning time. The code for this method is publicly accessible. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a dual-pruning strategy that synergizes two established methodologies—Width and Depth Pruning—tailoring them for LLMs. This integration marks a significant conceptual advance over traditional methods that generally focus on one type of pruning, thus presenting a more holistic approach to model optimization. **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Innovation:** By combining different pruning types, the approach purportedly capitalizes on the strengths of both, potentially leading to enhanced model performance while significantly reducing the computational overhead. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors rigorously test their method across multiple LLM families and robustness across various sparsity rates, demonstrating a solid foundation for their claims regarding performance improvement. 3. **Practical Relevance:** The reduction in pruning time could have considerable implications for the deployment of LLMs in real-world applications where efficiency is crucial. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper tests on multiple LLM families, it could benefit from a broader range of datasets and tasks to better establish the generalizability of the method. The reliance on perplexity might not be equally indicative of performance across diverse tasks and domains. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The introduction of a new balancing mechanism for sparsity may add complexity to the implementation. Clearer guidelines or benchmarks for practitioners on implementing this mechanism could enhance the paper’s practical applicability. 3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** While it outperforms current methods, a deeper analysis into the limitations of the competitors could strengthen the case for the proposed method’s superiority, rather than merely presenting performance comparisons. **Influence on the Field:** The combined approach of structured pruning in LLMs is likely to influence future research in model efficiency and optimization. It addresses a growing need in the field for practical methods to deploy large models in resource-constrained environments, which is critical as LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity. **Score: 8** ### Rationale: The paper earns a score of 8 due to its innovative approach that significantly contributes to the conversation on LLM optimization. The dual strategy is novel and the empirical results are compelling; however, the evaluation's limitations and potential issues with implementation complexity slightly temper its impact. Despite these concerns, the paper holds promise for inspiring further research and practical advancements in the domain of Large Language Models.

- **Authors**: Peter Pak, Amir Barati Farimani
- **Abstract**: In this work we investigate the ability of large language models to predict additive manufacturing defect regimes given a set of process parameter inputs. For this task we utilize a process parameter defect dataset to fine-tune a collection of models, titled AdditiveLLM, for the purpose of predicting potential defect regimes including Keyholing, Lack of Fusion, and Balling. We compare different methods of input formatting in order to gauge the model's performance to correctly predict defect regimes on our sparse Baseline dataset and our natural language Prompt dataset. The model displays robust predictive capability, achieving an accuracy of 93\% when asked to provide the defect regimes associated with a set of process parameters. The incorporation of natural language input further simplifies the task of process parameters selection, enabling users to identify optimal settings specific to their build.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "AdditiveLLM: Large Language Models Predict Defects in Additive Manufacturing" investigates how large language models (LLMs) can predict defects in additive manufacturing, such as Keyholing, Lack of Fusion, and Balling, using a dataset of process parameters. The authors developed a framework, termed AdditiveLLM, by fine-tuning several models on a specialized dataset to enhance defect prediction accuracy. They evaluated different input formatting methods, ultimately achieving a high accuracy of 93% in predicting defect regimes. By also integrating natural language inputs, the model simplifies the selection of optimal process parameters, making it more user-friendly for operators in additive manufacturing. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its application of large language models to a specific industrial challenge—defect prediction in additive manufacturing. The innovative approach of integrating natural language processing with parameter input streamlines the user experience and has practical implications for enhancing production quality and efficiency.  One of the paper's significant strengths is the high accuracy achieved (93%), suggesting that AdditiveLLM can reliably assist in defect identification, which is crucial in avoiding costly manufacturing errors. The comparative analysis of different input formats is another considerable merit, showcasing the adaptability of LLMs across diverse applications and amplifying the relevance of the findings. However, there are weaknesses worth noting. The study does not extensively discuss the dataset's scope—limited data could affect the model's generalizability outside the dataset used. Moreover, while the accuracy is impressive, it would be beneficial to include a more in-depth evaluation of the model's performance across various scenarios and conditions, such as different materials or process setups in additive manufacturing.  In terms of the paper's potential significance, while it opens up new avenues for application of LLMs in manufacturing defect prediction, the extent of its influence may be somewhat constrained by the specificity of the application. Broader implications for machine learning applications in industrial contexts may need further exploration. Overall, while the paper presents significant advancements in applying LLMs to a real-world problem and offers practical solutions, its limitations in dataset representation and a lack of extensive validation criteria temper its revolutionary potential. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17840v1)
- **Authors**: Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various tasks, yet their ability to extract and internalize deeper insights from domain-specific datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how continual pre-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for insight learning across three distinct forms: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic insights. Focusing on two critical domains: medicine and finance, we employ LoRA to train LLMs on two existing datasets. To evaluate each insight type, we create benchmarks to measure how well continual pre-training helps models go beyond surface-level knowledge. We also assess the impact of document modification on capturing insights. The results show that, while continual pre-training on original documents has a marginal effect, modifying documents to retain only essential information significantly enhances the insight-learning capabilities of LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?" explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting and internalizing deeper insights from domain-specific data, particularly in the fields of medicine and finance. It investigates three types of insight learning—declarative, statistical, and probabilistic—through the methodology of continual pre-training combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Using benchmarks specifically designed to measure insight levels, the study finds that while continual pre-training on original datasets has limited effects on insight learning, modifying these datasets to focus on essential information significantly improves LLM performance in understanding domain-specific insights. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Impact:** The paper addresses an important gap in the literature concerning the ability of LLMs to go beyond surface-level understanding in specialized domains. By combining continual pre-training with LoRA and introducing methodology for assessing different types of insights, the work moves the conversation about LLM capabilities forward.  **Strengths:** 1. **Relevant Domain Focus**: The choice of medicine and finance as domains highlights both the practical relevance and potential impact of the research. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The formulation of benchmarks to measure insight learning is a strength, as it allows for a more nuanced assessment of model performance compared to traditional metrics. 3. **Throughput of Effective Training**: The findings suggest practical strategies—like document modification—that can lead to better LLM outcomes, providing actionable insights for practitioners in AI and education. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Marginal Effects**: The study indicates that continual pre-training on original documents has only a marginal positive effect, which may limit the perceived utility of the method. 2. **Specificity of Results**: The evaluation is somewhat limited to two domains, which might not generalize across all fields where LLMs are applied. 3. **Depth of Insight Types**: While the categorization of insight types is useful, the paper could benefit from deeper exploration of how these insights impact real-world tasks. Overall, while the paper demonstrates innovative methods for enhancing LLMs' insight capabilities, the implications are somewhat constrained by a narrow focus and limited generalizability. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's significant contribution to the field regarding the practical enhancements of LLMs in domain-specific contexts, while also acknowledging limitations in scope and the marginal improvements observed in original document training. The methodologies introduced hold promise for future research directions and applications, making this work a valuable addition to the discourse on LLM capabilities.

### Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17858v1)
- **Authors**: Rui Min, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Minhao Cheng, Min Lin
- **Abstract**: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled **"Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging"** investigates the integrity of ranking mechanisms used in the Chatbot Arena, a platform for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through user voting in pairwise battles. The authors reveal that the crowdsourced voting system can be manipulated to artificially enhance or diminish a target model's ranking. They present two key strategies for vote rigging: a straightforward method that focuses on directly influencing battles involving the target model using identification techniques, and more effective "omnipresent" strategies that leverage the Elo rating system. These omnipresent strategies allow users to influence the ranking of a model without requiring it to be involved in a particular battle. The authors support their claims with empirical experiments based on 1.7 million historical votes, demonstrating that it’s feasible to improve rankings with minimal effort from riggers. They also address the implications of these findings by evaluating possible defenses against such rigging practices. ### Critical Evaluation of the Paper: #### Novelty: The paper tackles a pertinent issue within the field of machine learning and LLM evaluation, addressing the susceptibility of crowdsourced voting systems to manipulation. The exploration of omnipresent rigging strategies adds a new dimension to existing discussions on model evaluation, moving beyond traditional concerns of model performance to the integrity of the platforms themselves. However, while vote rigging as a concept is not entirely new, the specific application to Chatbot Arena and the focus on strategies exploiting the Elo rating mechanism represent new insights into the robustness of LLM evaluations. #### Significance: The implications of successfully rigging votes are significant as they could skew the perceived quality of LLMs, leading to misguided investments in technology and misinformed research directions. The authors' emphasis on the need for improved defenses against vote rigging is also crucial for the future of model evaluations.  #### Strengths: 1. **Methodological Rigor**: The use of substantial historical voting data provides a robust basis for their claims. 2. **Innovative Strategies**: The introduction of omnipresent rigging strategies is a novel approach to the problem of vote manipulation, shedding light on less direct but potentially more impactful methods. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Implementation Concerns**: While the paper discusses manipulation strategies, it does not delve deeply into practical countermeasures that platforms could adopt, nor does it provide detailed suggestions for better safeguards against such behaviors. 2. **Ethical Considerations**: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the ethical implications of rigging strategies in model evaluations and the potential consequences for the research community. In conclusion, while the paper sheds light on a critical vulnerability within LLM evaluation platforms and introduces innovative manipulation strategies, its practical implications and proposed defenses are somewhat lacking. The novelty of the approach and the pressing nature of the problem contribute to its significance in the field. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901v1)
- **Authors**: Jakub Adamczyk, Piotr Ludynia, Wojciech Czech
- **Abstract**: We study the effectiveness of molecular fingerprints for peptide property prediction and demonstrate that domain-specific feature extraction from molecular graphs can outperform complex and computationally expensive models such as GNNs, pretrained sequence-based transformers and multimodal ensembles, even without hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation on 126 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRGB and 5 other peptide function prediction benchmarks. We show that models based on count variants of ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit molecular fingerprints and LightGBM as classification head are remarkably robust. The strong performance of molecular fingerprints, which are intrinsically very short-range feature encoders, challenges the presumed importance of long-range interactions in peptides. Our conclusion is that the use of molecular fingerprints for larger molecules, such as peptides, can be a computationally feasible, low-parameter, and versatile alternative to sophisticated deep learning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the utility of molecular fingerprints for predicting peptide functions, proposing that these fingerprints can be more effective than advanced models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformer-based frameworks. By analyzing 126 datasets, the authors report state-of-the-art performance on several peptide function benchmarks, including LRGB. Their findings indicate that models employing molecular fingerprints—specifically ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit with LightGBM as the classification head—show remarkable robustness and computational efficiency. The authors argue that the effectiveness of short-range feature encoders, such as molecular fingerprints, calls into question the previously held belief in the necessity of considering long-range interactions in peptide functionality. Ultimately, the paper advocates for the adoption of molecular fingerprints as a practical, low-parameter solution for peptide function prediction, suggesting it could significantly streamline computational approaches in the field. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel approach by challenging the established preference for complex models in peptide function prediction. The emphasis on molecular fingerprints, which have historically been seen as less effective for larger molecules, highlights a significant shift in perspective that could potentially alter standard practices in biomedical informatics. The comprehensive evaluation across 126 datasets further strengthens its contribution by providing broad applicability and validation of its findings. **Significance:** The argument that simple models can match, or even surpass, the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning approaches is both provocative and timely. In an era of increasing focus on interpretability and computational expense in machine learning, especially in the life sciences, the potential to bypass complicated architectures for simpler, yet effective models is highly relevant. This could lead to wider accessibility and implementation of peptide prediction models in various research and clinical settings. **Strengths:** The study’s thorough evaluation using diverse datasets showcases the robustness of the proposed methods, and its results have implications for both computational efficiency and practical application. The conclusion drawn challenges existing assumptions regarding molecular interaction importance, a fresh perspective that may guide future research directions. **Weaknesses:** However, while the paper claims its approach is more effective, the authors do not delve deeply into why molecular fingerprints outperform these models beyond computational simplicity, limiting the theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Additionally, without hyperparameter tuning, the generalizability of the results across varying contexts remains uncertain. It would benefit from further exploration into the underlying biological interpretations of the findings. In summary, this paper makes a notable advance in the field of peptide function prediction by providing a viable alternative to complex models using molecular fingerprints. Its implications for research practices could lead to significant improvements in efficiency and effectiveness. **Score: 8**

### DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17905v1)
- **Authors**: Mingkuan Feng, Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Pengpeng Shao, Ruihan Jin, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Feihu Che
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models" addresses the challenges posed by the increasing computational and memory costs associated with large language models (LLMs) due to their scale. While existing pruning techniques generally utilize a prune-then-finetune approach, this method can result in significant information loss and performance degradation, requiring extensive finetuning efforts to regain original performance. The authors propose a new approach: DReSS (Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining), which applies regularization first, then pruning, followed by finetuning. This method allows the model to retain important information before parameter removal and significantly reduces latency and boosts throughput. Experimental results indicate that DReSS outperforms traditional pruning methods, particularly in situations involving aggressive pruning ratios. **Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper stems from its proposed approach that integrates regularization before pruning, shifting away from the conventionally used prune-then-finetune framework. This methodological innovation is significant as it mitigates information loss, potentially preserving model performance while reducing size. This aspect is especially crucial in the context of LLMs, where efficiency is paramount due to the growing prominence of these models in real-world applications. Strengths of DReSS include: 1. **Innovative Paradigm:** The adjustment of the pruning paradigm using a pre-pruning regularization step is both novel and potentially transformative for future pruning strategies within LLMs. 2. **Demonstrated Benefits:** The experimental results provide solid evidence that DReSS performs better than traditional methods, indicating practical implications for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments. 3. **Potential Utility:** The approach could be widely applicable in the field of NLP as organizations look to optimize LLMs for various applications. However, the paper does have some weaknesses: 1. **Lack of Comprehensive Comparison:** While DReSS shows improvements over existing methods, further comparative analyses with a wider range of pruning techniques and architectures could strengthen the findings. 2. **Generalizability:** The effectiveness of DReSS on different types of tasks or datasets remains to be extensively evaluated. A broader evaluation could help validate its robustness and adaptability. In summary, the paper presents a valuable and timely contribution to the field of large language model optimization by addressing performance issues associated with pruning. The proposed DReSS method holds promise for both theoretical understanding and practical applications but could benefit from broader validation. **Score: 8**

Despite this growing attention, their applicability in culturally responsive Indigenous educational settings like Hawai`i's public schools and Kaiapuni (immersion language) programs, remains understudied. Additionally, `Olelo Hawai`i, the Hawaiian language, as a low-resource language, poses unique challenges and concerns about cultural sensitivity and the reliability of generated content. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), this study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of using LLMs for culturally revitalizing computer science (CS) education in Hawaiian public schools with Kaiapuni programs. Our findings highlight AI's time-saving advantages while exposing challenges such as cultural misalignment and reliability concerns. We conclude with design recommendations for future AI tools to better align with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical practices, towards the broader goal of trustworthy, effective, and culturally grounded AI technologies.

### Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17974v1)
- **Authors**: Zishun Yu, Tengyu Xu, Di Jin, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Yun He, Wenxuan Zhou, Zhouhao Zeng, Eryk Helenowski, Chen Zhu, Sinong Wang, Hao Ma, Han Fang
- **Abstract**: Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization" addresses a limitation of large language models (LLMs) in solving mathematical problems, particularly regarding their tendency to apply lengthy reasoning processes, which can be inefficient for simpler queries. The authors introduce a novel approach named Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO), which optimizes reasoning efforts by allowing models to discern the difficulty of queries and allocate reasoning resources based on this assessment. Through fine-tuning with IBPO, models demonstrate improved performance on the MATH500 benchmark, achieving notable absolute improvements over existing models (LLaMA3.1) under varied inference budgets. Specifically, they report performance enhancements of 4.14% and 5.74% with respective inference budgets, which are double the improvements achieved using self-consistency methods. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The core contribution of the paper is the introduction of inference-aware optimization that guides models in resource allocation based on query difficulty. This concept is relatively novel as it combines utility maximization principles with LLMs, addressing a specific inefficiency in reasoning processes. While the idea of optimizing reasoning has been explored in various contexts, the specific implementation of IBPO presents a fresh perspective on how models can adapt their reasoning efforts dynamically. **Significance:** The findings could have practical implications for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs in educational contexts or applications requiring rapid problem-solving. The reported improvements in performance metrics provide quantitative evidence of the benefits of the proposed methodology, signaling its potential to influence future research directions in adaptive reasoning and model optimization. **Strengths:** - The methodology is well-defined and grounded in established principles of optimization. - Empirical results are substantial, with clear comparisons to existing benchmarks, establishing the effectiveness of the proposed approach. - The paper tackles an important problem in making LLMs more efficient without compromising their performance on complex tasks. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a broader range of experiments to validate the robustness of IBPO across different types of problems and datasets beyond MATH500. - The model's dependency on accurately assessing query difficulty introduces a challenge in generalization, which is not fully addressed. - Comparisons against other optimization techniques could have been more extensive to provide a clearer context of its relative advantages. **Overall Assessment:** The paper presents a significant step in enhancing the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. While it introduces a promising framework and demonstrates concrete improvements, it would be strengthened by further exploration of model generalizability and more extensive comparisons. ### Score: 7 This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with a good balance of novelty and practical application; however, the areas of generalization and comparative analysis suggest room for enhancement, thereby preventing a higher score.

- **Authors**: Didier Chételat, Joseph Cotnareanu, Rylee Thompson, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) contain substantial factual knowledge which is commonly elicited by multiple-choice question-answering prompts. Internally, such models process the prompt through multiple transformer layers, building varying representations of the problem within its hidden states. Ultimately, however, only the hidden state corresponding to the final layer and token position are used to predict the answer label. In this work, we propose instead to learn a small separate neural network predictor module on a collection of training questions, that take the hidden states from all the layers at the last temporal position as input and outputs predictions. In effect, such a framework disentangles the representational abilities of LLMs from their predictive abilities. On a collection of hard benchmarks, our method achieves considerable improvements in performance, sometimes comparable to supervised fine-tuning procedures, but at a fraction of the computational cost.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "InnerThoughts: Disentangling Representations and Predictions in Large Language Models" addresses the way large language models (LLMs) utilize their internal representations when generating predictions. Instead of relying solely on the final hidden state for answering questions, the authors propose a novel approach in which a separate small neural network predictor module uses hidden states from all layers at the last time step to make predictions. This method effectively separates the representational capabilities of LLMs from their predictive functions. The authors demonstrate that this disentangled approach leads to significant improvements across various challenging benchmarks while maintaining lower computational costs compared to traditional supervised fine-tuning techniques. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces a compelling innovation by advocating for a clear distinction between representation learning and prediction in LLMs, which is a well-defined problem within the domain of deep learning and natural language processing. By utilizing the collective hidden states across all transformer layers instead of a single final state, the authors provide a fresh perspective on enhancing the predictive power of LLMs without the hefty computational burden associated with supervised fine-tuning. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The framework proposed is an original approach to leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs, potentially opening new avenues for research and practical applications. 2. **Performance**: The reported improvements in performance on challenging benchmarks suggest that the method can yield substantial benefits over existing solutions. 3. **Efficiency**: By minimizing computational costs while achieving comparable results to supervised methods, the approach is particularly significant in environments where resource allocation is critical. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the paper reports improved performance on specific benchmarks, it is essential to ascertain whether these gains are generalizable across a wider range of tasks and contexts. 2. **Complexity**: Introducing a separate neural predictor could result in added complexity in model deployment, which may deter some practitioners who prefer streamlined solutions. 3. **Abstraction Level**: The disentangling of representations and predictions, while theoretically appealing, may require empirical validation across diverse applications in real-world scenarios for broader acceptance. **Potential Influence**: The paper stands to shift current practices in the training and utilization of LLMs, promoting a shift toward more efficient and modular approaches. It invites further exploration of multilayer representations in both academic and applied settings, which could enhance the capabilities of AI systems across various domains. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions in terms of innovation and efficiency improvement, while also recognizing the need for broader empirical validation and potential challenges in adoption. It is a noteworthy contribution that could significantly impact future research and applications in the field of natural language processing while leaving room for exploration and refinement.

### Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation Generated Stack Traces
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18005v1)
- **Authors**: Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer
- **Abstract**: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a method for fault localization in software crashes using large language models (LLMs) trained solely on stack trace data. Traditional fault localization methods require extensive supplementary data, such as source code or test failures, which are often unavailable in production environments. The authors specifically tackle scenarios where the root cause of a crash is not indicated by the closest stack trace entries. To address the limitations posed by a lack of historical crash data, the authors augment their dataset by generating synthetic crashes through code mutation, resulting in a dataset of 64,369 crashes from 4.1 million mutations from the SAP HANA code base. The approach yields a fault localization accuracy of 66.9%, substantially outperforming baseline methods that achieved 12.6% and 10.6%. Further testing on other open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, reveals accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. The results suggest that fine-tuning LLMs is significantly more effective than using non-finetuned models for fault localization in these scenarios. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper introduces a significant innovation by applying fine-tuning of LLMs to the specific domain of fault localization using only stack trace information. This is particularly valuable as it addresses a common issue faced by developers in production systems where relevant data beyond stack traces is often unavailable. By combining mutation-generated data with LLMs, the authors create an effective method for addressing a crucial gap in software debugging. **Significance:** The proposed method has the potential to impact software debugging practices significantly, especially in contexts where crashes need to be diagnosed rapidly and effectively. The paper contributes new insights into the capabilities of LLMs in handling specialized programming tasks. However, the real-world applicability depends on the further validation of the approach across a wider range of software and error scenarios. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of synthetic crash data to augment the training dataset for LLMs is a clever way to address data scarcity. 2. **Empirical Results:** The results demonstrate a clear performance improvement over existing methods, providing solid evidence of the approach's effectiveness. 3. **Cross-Domain Validation:** The evaluation on multiple datasets adds credibility to the generalizability of the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Data Limitations:** Although the paper utilizes a large number of mutations, the reliance on synthetic crash data could raise concerns about the realism and diversity of the generated crash scenarios. 2. **Specific to Stack Traces:** While the method excels with stack trace information, it may struggle in complex cases where additional context is needed, limiting its applicability. 3. **Comparative Baselines:** The choice of baseline methods and their relevance to the findings is not elaborated in detail, which may limit the interpretation of performance improvements. ### Conclusion Overall, this paper significantly advances techniques for fault localization using machine learning and addresses a notable gap in the ability to handle crashes in production environments. The focus on utilizing LLMs specifically for this purpose is both timely and relevant, given the increasing complexity of software systems. **Score: 8**   The score reflects the paper's contributions in terms of novelty, effective methodology, and practical relevance, while considering its potential limitations in the scope and dataset used. The high score signifies a meaningful advancement in the field, although further validation and exploration of real-world scenarios is necessary for broader adoption.

### Large Language Models Think Too Fast To Explore Effectively
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18009v1)
- **Authors**: Lan Pan, Hanbo Xie, Robert C. Wilson
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models have emerged many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore, an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with those traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the exploratory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of open-ended tasks using the game Little Alchemy 2 as a testbed. It finds that most LLMs do not perform as well as humans in exploring and discovering new combinations of elements, with the exception of the o1 model. The research presents insight into the decision-making processes of LLMs, which primarily rely on uncertainty-driven strategies, contrasting with humans who utilize a combination of uncertainty and empowerment. A deeper analysis reveals that LLMs process uncertainty earlier in their architecture (with Sparse Autoencoders) while empowerment is processed at later stages, resulting in accelerated but less effective exploratory behaviors. Consequently, this research highlights a critical limitation of LLMs and suggests avenues for enhancing their adaptability. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents a novel exploration of LLM capabilities, specifically in the area of exploration, which has been relatively overlooked in existing literature. Given the growing reliance on LLMs for various applications, understanding their efficacy in exploratory tasks is timely and significant. The choice of a game-based framework like Little Alchemy 2 provides a concrete and engaging way to assess this capability, adding practical relevance. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Focus:** The focus on exploration versus conventional benchmarks of intelligence is a fresh perspective that adds depth to the understanding of LLMs. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: The direct comparison of LLMs with human performance provides valuable insights and grounds the research in relatable metrics. 3. **Technical Examination:** The use of Sparse Autoencoders for representational analysis is methodologically robust and offers a unique lens to scrutinize the underlying mechanics of LLM decision-making. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The research is confined to a single game, which may not fully represent the diverse landscapes and complexities of various open-ended tasks LLMs might face. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** Results may vary significantly with different LLM architectures or other contexts, which the paper does not explore explicitly. 3. **Preliminary Findings**: While the findings are valuable, they set the stage for future research rather than providing comprehensive solutions for enhancing exploration in LLMs. The paper makes strides towards understanding the exploratory limitations of LLMs and sets a foundation for future work in the area. However, while the novelty is notable, the somewhat narrow focus and its implications limit its reach. Overall, the work is an important contribution but leaves substantial room for further exploration. **Score: 7**

### A Proximal Operator for Inducing 2:4-Sparsity
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18015v1)
- **Authors**: Jonas M Kübler, Yu-Xiang Wang, Shoham Sabach, Navid Ansari, Matthäus Kleindessner, Kailash Budhathoki, Volkan Cevher, George Karypis
- **Abstract**: Recent hardware advancements in AI Accelerators and GPUs allow to efficiently compute sparse matrix multiplications, especially when 2 out of 4 consecutive weights are set to zero. However, this so-called 2:4 sparsity usually comes at a decreased accuracy of the model. We derive a regularizer that exploits the local correlation of features to find better sparsity masks in trained models. We minimize the regularizer jointly with a local squared loss by deriving the proximal operator for which we show that it has an efficient solution in the 2:4-sparse case. After optimizing the mask, we use maskedgradient updates to further minimize the local squared loss. We illustrate our method on toy problems and apply it to pruning entire large language models up to 70B parameters. On models up to 13B we improve over previous state of the art algorithms, whilst on 70B models we match their performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper addresses the challenge of achieving 2:4 sparsity in neural networks, a structure where 2 out of 4 consecutive weights are set to zero, leveraging the efficiency of modern AI hardware for sparse matrix multiplications. The authors introduce a new regularizer that captures the local correlations among features in order to derive improved sparsity masks from pretrained models, thereby aiming to mitigate the accuracy loss typically associated with inducing this type of sparsity. They present a proximal operator specifically suited to this 2:4-sparse scenario, revealing an efficient computation method. Post-optimization, they employ masked gradient updates to minimize local squared loss further. Their methodology is validated using toy problems and scaling up to large language models with 70 billion parameters, where they achieve results on par with or superior to existing state-of-the-art sparse training algorithms for models up to 13 billion parameters. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The derivation of a proximal operator tailored for 2:4 sparsity is a noteworthy innovation. It paves the way for more effective sparsity induction methods, particularly crucial as models grow larger. 2. **Practical Implications**: By demonstrating improved performance on large language models, the work has tangible implications for real-world applications, where efficiency and resource conservation are paramount. 3. **Comprehensive Assessment**: The authors validate their approach on both toy problems and large-scale models, providing a thorough evaluation of its effectiveness and robustness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparison Limitations**: While the paper claims improved performance, it lacks formal benchmarks against a broader array of state-of-the-art methods. More extensive comparative analyses would strengthen the claims of superiority over existing techniques. 2. **Potential Overfitting**: The focus on local features may risk overfitting in specific contexts, especially when applied to highly diverse datasets with less predictable feature interactions. **Potential Influence**: The paper expands the conversation around sparsity in neural network optimization and may inspire subsequent research exploring similar regularization strategies. However, the extent of its influence will depend on how widely the 2:4 sparsity framework is adopted in practice. Considering the innovative approach, practical implications, and the strengths and weaknesses outlined, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a strong contribution to the field with the potential for meaningful application, tempered by the need for more rigorous comparative analyses and considerations of generalizability. **Score: 7**

### SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18052v1)
- **Authors**: Bartosz Cywiński, Kamil Deja
- **Abstract**: Recent machine unlearning approaches offer promising solution for removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models. However, traditional methods, which largely rely on fine-tuning, provide little insight into the changes they introduce to the base model, making it unclear whether concepts are truly removed or only masked. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to unlearn unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a method of selecting concept-specific features. This enables precise interventions on the model's activations to block targeted content while preserving the model's overall performance. Evaluation on the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron dismisses the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack.
- **Summary**: ### Concise Summary The paper "SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders" addresses the challenge of effectively removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models used in text-to-image applications. Traditional fine-tuning approaches lack transparency regarding their impact on the model, leading to ambiguities about whether concepts are genuinely unlearned or merely masked. The authors introduce SAeUron, a novel method that utilizes sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to capture interpretable, concept-specific features from the model's activation data across various denoising steps. By manipulating these features, SAeUron effectively blocks the targeted content without degrading the model’s overall performance. The method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, demonstrating its ability to simultaneously unlearn multiple concepts and prevent the emergence of unwanted outputs, even during adversarial conditions. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** SAeUron presents a significant advancement in the area of machine unlearning, particularly concerning its transparency and effectiveness compared to existing methods. The usage of sparse autoencoders to facilitate concept unlearning is innovative, offering a clear methodology for selecting and intervening in model features. This not only enhances the interpretability of the changes made to the model but also empowers practitioners with a more profound understanding of how specific concepts are represented in diffusion models. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The combination of sparse autoencoders with diffusion model architectures is relatively novel and could stimulate further research into interpretable AI and robust unlearning techniques. 2. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: The validation against the UnlearnCanvas benchmark illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, suggesting it could become a standard in the field. 3. **Multi-concept Unlearning**: The capability to discard multiple concepts simultaneously adds practical value and flexibility in applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Generalizability**: While the paper shows strong results in specific benchmarks, the generalizability of the approach to different model architectures or datasets remains untested within the scope of the paper. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The introduction of sparse autoencoders adds an extra layer of complexity, which might pose challenges for practitioners less familiar with such methods. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The evaluation metrics used in the benchmark could be critiqued for not fully capturing the nuances of model performance post-unlearning, particularly in real-world applications where unintended consequences might arise. **Potential Influence:** The contribution of this paper could reshape how researchers and practitioners approach the challenge of unlearning in AI models, leading to more interpretable and transparent methods. It could pave the way for more advanced applications in sensitive domains such as privacy-preserving AI and bias mitigation. **Score: 8** The score reflects the paper's strong novelty and the significant advancements it makes in the field of machine unlearning, while also acknowledging some limitations in applicability and complexity.

- **Authors**: Duy A. Nguyen, Rishi Kesav Mohan, Van Yang, Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang
- **Abstract**: Query rewriting (QR) is a critical technique in e-commerce search, addressing the lexical gap between user queries and product descriptions to enhance search performance. Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories: discriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models (LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language understanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative LLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and cost in online settings. These limitations force offline deployment, making them vulnerable to issues like information staleness and semantic drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline for QR that balances efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach combines offline knowledge distillation to create a lightweight but efficient student model with online reinforcement learning (RL) to refine query rewriting dynamically using real-time feedback. A key innovation is the use of LLMs as simulated human feedback, enabling scalable reward signals and cost-effective evaluation without manual annotations. Experimental results on Amazon ESCI dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, as well as positive feedback from the LLM simulation. This work contributes to advancing LLM capabilities for domain-specific applications, offering a robust solution for dynamic and complex e-commerce search environments.

- **Abstract**: FinanceQA is a testing suite that evaluates LLMs' performance on complex numerical financial analysis tasks that mirror real-world investment work. Despite recent advances, current LLMs fail to meet the strict accuracy requirements of financial institutions, with models failing approximately 60% of realistic tasks that mimic on-the-job analyses at hedge funds, private equity firms, investment banks, and other financial institutions. The primary challenges include hand-spreading metrics, adhering to standard accounting and corporate valuation conventions, and performing analysis under incomplete information - particularly in multi-step tasks requiring assumption generation. This performance gap highlights the disconnect between existing LLM capabilities and the demands of professional financial analysis that are inadequately tested by current testing architectures. Results show that higher-quality training data is needed to support such tasks, which we experiment with using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. FinanceQA is publicly released at [this https URL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AfterQuery/FinanceQA).

### Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18081v1)
- **Authors**: Pratik S. Sachdeva, Tom van Nuenen
- **Abstract**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of this research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess how well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or political ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to relatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and nuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along more detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better assess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this end, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on everyday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to assign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We then compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to each other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results demonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral judgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit. LLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model agreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in how models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the complexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and the need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical judgment. As LLMs continue to be used in roles requiring ethical decision-making such as therapists and companions, careful evaluation is crucial to mitigate potential biases and limitations.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas" assesses the ethical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through complex moral dilemmas drawn from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community on Reddit. The authors critique existing methods that oversimplify moral evaluation by prompting LLMs with survey-style questions and argue that a more detailed approach is necessary for a nuanced understanding of LLM moral frameworks. In their study, they analyzed responses from seven LLMs to over 10,000 AITA scenarios, comparing the models' judgments and explanations to those of Reddit users. The findings indicate that while LLMs show moderate to high self-consistency in their moral reasoning, they demonstrate low agreement between models and significantly differ in their ethical evaluations from human users. This underscores the challenge of achieving consistent moral reasoning in artificial intelligence systems and stresses the importance of thorough evaluation for applications in domains requiring ethical decision-making. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance** The paper makes a notable contribution by shifting the evaluation of LLMs from simplistic survey questions to the rich domain of everyday moral dilemmas. This approach highlights the complexity of moral reasoning in LLMs, which has often been overlooked in existing literature. By focusing on real-world scenarios that involve nuanced ethical considerations, the authors provide new insights into how LLMs navigate moral judgments, thus opening up avenues for more sophisticated analysis and critique of AI ethics. **Strengths** 1. **Empirical Analysis**: The use of a large dataset (over 10,000 moral dilemmas) adds rigor to the study and allows for robust comparisons across models and with human judgments. 2. **Conceptual Depth**: The examination of distinct patterns in moral reasoning provides a deeper understanding of how LLMs interpret and apply various moral principles, which was largely missing in earlier studies. 3. **Relevance**: This work addresses urgent concerns about the implications of LLMs in sensitive roles, thereby informing both researchers and practitioners about potential biases. **Weaknesses** 1. **Limited Model Diversity**: The evaluation focuses on seven LLMs, which may not represent the broader diversity of models available; wider inclusion could enhance the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Interpretation of Results**: While the findings emphasize differences between LLMs and human judgments, the paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of why these discrepancies exist, linking to more extensive sociocultural contexts. 3. **Potential Overreach**: The conclusions about moral reasoning might risk implying a level of ethical agency in LLMs that is not warranted; the paper should clarify the limitations of interpreting LLM outputs as "moral reasoning." ### Conclusion Overall, while the paper presents robust findings that advance the discussion on LLMs and moral reasoning, its novelty is somewhat tempered by existing literature on AI ethics and decision-making processes. The implications of this study are significant for both academic research and practical applications involving LLMs; however, further investigations are needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the nuances in LLM ethical frameworks. The incorporation of diverse models and deeper contextual analyses in future work could enhance the contribution to the field. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18094v1)
- **Authors**: Da Chang, Yu Li, Ganzhao Yuan
- **Abstract**: In the training of large language models (LLMs), updating parameters more efficiently and stably has always been an important challenge. To achieve efficient parameter updates, existing methods usually achieve performance comparable to full parameter updates through methods such as low-dimensional decomposition or layer-wise selective updates. In this work, we propose AlphaAdam, an optimization framework for LLM from the perspective of intra-layer parameter updates. By decoupling parameter updates and dynamically adjusting their strength, AlphaAdam accelerates convergence and improves training stability. We construct parameter masks based on the consistency of historical momentum and gradient direction and combine them with an adaptive mask strength strategy to ensure efficient optimization and theoretical convergence guarantees, which is also applicable to most momentum-based optimizers. Extensive experiments show that AlphaAdam outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as AdamW in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency across tasks, including GPT-2 pre-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa and Llama-7B. Our AlphaAdam implements an optimizer enhancement framework for LLMs through intra-layer asynchronous masked adaptive updates. Our code is available in this \href{https://github.com/MaeChd/AlphaAdam}{link}
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces AlphaAdam, a novel optimization framework designed for training large language models (LLMs) more efficiently and stably. It addresses the challenges associated with parameter updates by decoupling them and dynamically adjusting their intensity. AlphaAdam employs parameter masks based on historical momentum consistency and gradient direction, coupled with an adaptive mask strength strategy, which collectively enhance optimization efficiency and ensure theoretical convergence. The framework is shown to outperform existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly AdamW, across various tasks including GPT-2 and RoBERTa fine-tuning, by accelerating convergence and improving computational efficiency. The implementation of AlphaAdam can be accessed via their provided GitHub link.  **Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty**: The concept of asynchronous masked optimization with dynamic alpha introduces a fresh approach to parameter updates by focusing on intra-layer updates rather than traditional full-parameter updates. This is notable within the landscape of optimizers, as most existing algorithms do not effectively decouple update mechanisms or adapt strength based on historical data. However, the idea of using masks and momentum is not entirely new, as related techniques have been explored in the context of other optimizers in earlier works. 2. **Significance**: The optimization of parameter updates for speed and stability is critical given the increasing complexity and size of LLMs. The proposed method shows practical improvements in training efficiency, which is significant for real-world applications where computational resources are limited. The ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several models indicates that AlphaAdam may influence future research and applications in LLM training. 3. **Strengths**:    - The paper comprehensively presents theoretical convergence guarantees, elevating the reliability of the proposed method.    - It provides empirical evidence of performance improvements over existing methods, enhancing its credibility.    - The accessible code implementation promotes reproducibility, which is vital for advancement in the field. 4. **Weaknesses**:    - There is limited discussion of the computational complexity of implementing AlphaAdam compared to simpler optimizers, which could affect its adoption.    - While performance metrics are reported, more detailed analysis and ablation studies demonstrating the effectiveness of each component could strengthen arguments. 5. **Influence**: Given the continuous growth in the use of LLMs, advancements in optimization techniques that promise efficiency gains are likely to have a lasting impact. AlphaAdam provides a relevant contribution to the optimization toolkit for LLMs, making it significant in the current research landscape. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to the optimization domain for LLMs, but it recognizes the limitations regarding novelty and computational considerations. The work is poised to make a significant impact, but additional exploration and validation in broader contexts would solidify its standing in the field.

- **Authors**: Kumar Ashutosh, Yossi Gandelsman, Xinlei Chen, Ishan Misra, Rohit Girdhar
- **Abstract**: We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver), a novel approach to impart multimodal capabilities to large language models (LLMs) without the need for specialized training. By utilizing the LLM's inherent multi-step reasoning abilities, MILS generates multiple candidate outputs for a given task. These outputs are then scored and iteratively refined to arrive at a final solution. This technique not only enables zero-shot captioning for images, videos, and audio—setting new state-of-the-art benchmarks—but also enhances media generation tasks such as text-to-image generation and style transfer. Furthermore, MILS operates as a gradient-free optimization method, facilitating cross-modal arithmetic by inverting multimodal embeddings into text. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of MILS lies in its training-free methodology, which allows LLMs to leverage existing capabilities to address multimodal tasks. Compared to traditional approaches that require extensive training on task-specific datasets, MILS offers a simpler pathway for integrating multimodal functionalities. The state-of-the-art results in zero-shot multimodal tasks are significant and highlight the model’s effectiveness, potentially streamlining workflows in fields like data analysis, creative generation, and human-computer interaction. However, while the paper presents compelling results, there are several critical points to consider. First, the simplicity of the approach may mask underlying complexities regarding how LLMs handle multimodal inputs. It remains unclear how well MILS scales with more complex tasks or larger datasets. Additionally, the iterative scoring process, while promising, could be resource-intensive and may suffer from inefficiencies not addressed within the study. The potential for overfitting on the scoring mechanism itself—or the risk of bias in generated outputs—also warrants caution and further investigation. Overall, while the paper suggests a significant advancement in how LLMs can operate multimodally, its practical implications and limitations need careful consideration. Future work will be necessary to explore the scalability and robustness of MILS beyond the presented experiments. **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field through its innovative training-free approach to multimodal LLM applications. However, the potential risks associated with its efficiency and the need for deeper exploration of its limitations prevented a higher score.

### Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18099v1)
- **Authors**: Swarnadeep Saha, Xian Li, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Jason Weston, Tianlu Wang
- **Abstract**: LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents EvalPlanner, an innovative algorithm designed to enhance the process of evaluating responses generated by large language models (LLMs). Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches often limit their reasoning to pre-defined frameworks, including specific criteria and manually generated components. EvalPlanner diverges from this norm by generating an unconstrained evaluation plan, executing it, and rendering a final judgment. Through a self-training mechanism involving synthetic evaluation plans and executions, EvalPlanner optimizes reasoning capabilities, resulting in improved final verdicts. The method sets a new benchmark in performance for generative reward models on the RewardBench, achieving a score of 93.9 and demonstrating efficacy across various other benchmarks such as RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies primarily in its approach to separating planning and execution within the evaluation process of LLMs. Previous methodologies often conflated these stages, potentially leading to rigid and less effective reasoning processes. By allowing for an unconstrained planning stage, the authors introduce flexibility that could lead to richer and more accurate evaluations of generated responses. One of the strengths of the paper is its empirical validation. The authors not only achieve state-of-the-art results on RewardBench but also demonstrate the effectiveness of EvalPlanner across multiple benchmarks. This broad testing supports the claim of efficacy and indicates that the method can generalize well to different types of evaluation tasks in the realm of LLMs. However, a potential weakness is the reliance on synthetically generated evaluation plans and preference pairs, which may not fully capture the nuances and complexities of human judgment. While self-training can provide significant advancements, the degree to which synthetic data can replace human annotations for establishing robust reasoning processes remains a point of contention. Future work may need to integrate more human-in-the-loop approaches to bolster the reliability of these evaluations. Overall, the paper represents a thoughtful advance in the landscape of LLM evaluation methodologies. It opens doors for subsequent research to explore the interplay between planning and reasoning in AI evaluations and offers a fresh perspective on approaching generative models' assessments. Considering the strengths of the undeniably innovative approach and its significant empirical contributions, along with noted weaknesses surrounding the reliance on synthetic evaluations, I assign this paper a score of **8**. **Score: 8**

### Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100v1)
- **Authors**: Yibo Wang, Tiansheng Huang, Li Shen, Huanjin Yao, Haotian Luo, Rui Liu, Naiqiang Tan, Jiaxing Huang, Dacheng Tao
- **Abstract**: Harmful fine-tuning attack introduces significant security risks to the fine-tuning services. Mainstream defenses aim to vaccinate the model such that the later harmful fine-tuning attack is less effective. However, our evaluation results show that such defenses are fragile -- with a few fine-tuning steps, the model still can learn the harmful knowledge. To this end, we do further experiment and find that an embarrassingly simple solution -- adding purely random perturbations to the fine-tuned model, can recover the model from harmful behavior, though it leads to a degradation in the model's fine-tuning performance. To address the degradation of fine-tuning performance, we further propose Panacea, which optimizes an adaptive perturbation that will be applied to the model after fine-tuning. Panacea maintains model's safety alignment performance without compromising downstream fine-tuning performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different harmful ratios, fine-tuning tasks and mainstream LLMs, where the average harmful scores are reduced by up-to 21.5%, while maintaining fine-tuning performance. As a by-product, we analyze the optimized perturbation and show that different layers in various LLMs have distinct safety coefficients. Source code available at https://github.com/w-yibo/Panacea
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled “Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation” addresses a significant security concern in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) — harmful fine-tuning attacks. Traditional defenses focus on making models resistant to these attacks, but this approach proves to be fragile as limited fine-tuning can successfully implant harmful knowledge into the model. The authors propose a straightforward yet effective remedy in the form of random perturbations following the fine-tuning process, which recovers the model’s safety but at a loss to its fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this performance degradation, they introduce "Panacea," a method that creates an adaptive perturbation specifically tailored to maintain safety while preserving fine-tuning efficacy. Their experiments show this approach reduces harmful outcomes by an impressive 21.5%, across multiple tasks and model architectures, all while preserving fine-tuning performance. The study also includes a detailed analysis of the perturbations, revealing distinct safety characteristics across different layers of various LLMs. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:**   The paper presents a novel approach to a crucial problem in the field of machine learning, particularly in the context of secure and reliable deployment of language models. While the use of random perturbations post-fine-tuning is simple, the identification of adaptive perturbations tailored to specific models and layers showcases a deeper level of innovation. This aspect positions the work within the rising concern over security in AI, particularly as LLMs become more pervasive in applications that require trustworthiness. **Strengths:**   1. **Practical Application:** The proposed method of adaptive perturbation is highly relevant given the increasing safety concerns associated with fine-tuning of LLMs. 2. **Empirical Support:** The authors provide comprehensive experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach across varied scenarios, thus supporting their claims robustly. 3. **Potential for Influence:** The methodology can be a game-changer in deploying fine-tuned models safely, influencing subsequent research and practices in the field. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Performance Trade-off:** While the method successfully mitigates harmful behavior, the explicit acknowledgment of performance degradation raises questions about its applicability in high-stakes settings where fine-tuned performance is paramount. 2. **Generalizability:** The effectiveness of knowledge protection through perturbations may vary widely across domains and contexts, which might limit the broader applicability of the findings. 3. **Limited Discussion on Long-term Impacts:** The potential for future adaptations or refinements of the technique was not thoroughly discussed, which may be a critical aspect for long-term implementation in changing environments. Overall, the paper addresses a relevant and growing concern in AI safety and security, bringing forth both an innovative solution and valuable practical insights.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s solid contribution to the field, particularly in mitigating specific risks of fine-tuning large language models, while also recognizing that there are trade-offs and limitations that could affect its broader adoption and applicability in various contexts.

### Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18107v1)
- **Authors**: Song Bian, Minghao Yan, Shivaram Venkataraman
- **Abstract**: Scaling laws are powerful tools to predict the performance of large language models. However, current scaling laws fall short of accounting for inference costs. In this work, we first show that model architecture affects inference latency, where models of the same size can have up to 3.5x difference in latency. To tackle this challenge, we modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to co-optimize the model parameter count, the number of training tokens, and the model architecture. Due to the reason that models of similar training loss exhibit gaps in downstream evaluation, we also propose a novel method to train inference-efficient models based on the revised scaling laws. We perform extensive empirical studies to fit and evaluate our inference-aware scaling laws. We vary model parameters from 80M to 1B, training tokens from 1.6B to 30B, and model shapes, training a total of 63 models. Guided by our inference-efficient scaling law and model selection method, we release the Morph-1B model, which improves inference latency by 1.8x while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks compared to open-source models, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy-latency tradeoff.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models" addresses the limitations of current scaling laws for language models, particularly their neglect of inference costs. The authors demonstrate that different model architectures can significantly impact inference latency, leading to disparities even among models of identical sizes. To address this gap, they modify the existing Chinchilla scaling laws to jointly optimize model parameters, training tokens, and architecture. They introduce a training method for inference-efficient models informed by these revised laws and validate their approach through extensive experiments involving 63 models spanning various sizes and training datasets. A notable outcome is the release of the Morph-1B model, which achieves a 1.8x reduction in inference latency while preserving downstream task accuracy, enhancing the accuracy-latency trade-off in language models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** This paper stands out in the field of natural language processing by introducing a new perspective on scaling laws that incorporates inference efficiency, a dimension often overlooked. The fact that the authors not only modify an established set of scaling laws but also propose a new training method based on empirical findings distinguishes their work significantly. The comprehensive empirical study involving 63 models showcases the robustness of their approach, enhancing its novelty. **Significance:** The implications of their findings are important as they push the boundaries of what is typically prioritized in model development. By successfully integrating latency optimization into the design of language models, the paper opens pathways for creating models that maintain competitive performance while being more practical in real-world applications, where inference speed is crucial. The release of Morph-1B exemplifies a tangible application of their theoretical advancements. **Strengths:** - Comprehensive empirical validation of their scaling laws. - The novel approach to co-optimizing architecture, parameters, and training tokens. - Potential to make significant contributions to practical applications of language models, particularly in latency-sensitive environments. **Weaknesses:** - The dependence on empirical studies may limit the theoretical underpinning of their findings, especially in understanding the complex dynamics of model architecture and inference. - Further exploration is needed to generalize their findings across more diverse model architectures and different tasks. **Potential Influence:** The study could influence future research directions by encouraging more model developers and researchers to consider inference costs alongside accuracy. It could also inspire subsequent modifications of scaling laws to incorporate additional efficiencies in other areas, such as resource consumption and robustness. Given these considerations, the paper presents a meaningful contribution to the field, advocating for a more holistic approach to language model scaling that combines performance with practical usability. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, Kai He, Zhen Peng, Fangzhi Xu, Ling Huang, Jingying Ma, Mengling Feng
- **Abstract**: Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a two-stage framework aimed at integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) by proposing a method called self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR). This method compresses both structural and semantic information from KGs into quantized codes or tokens, which align better with the format of language sentences, enhancing their usability in LLMs. The authors develop KG instruction-following data using these codes to improve how they are fed into LLMs, facilitating a seamless integration process. Experimental results indicate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantization techniques, yielding more distinguishable codes. Furthermore, fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 models showcase enhanced performance on knowledge graph-related tasks, relying on significantly fewer tokens per entity compared to traditional prompting methods. ### Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper introduces an innovative approach to bridging the gap between KGs and LLMs, a challenge that has been noted in existing literature. By employing self-supervised learning techniques to create quantized representations, the authors provide a fresh take on data integration strategies that is not only efficient but also effective. The concept of reducing the number of tokens per entity from thousands to just 16 is particularly noteworthy, as this could lead to significant efficiency gains in both resource usage and processing time.  #### Significance: The findings have substantial implications for how KGs can be leveraged within LLMs, particularly in tasks such as link prediction and classification. If widely adopted, this approach has the potential to enhance the operational scope and performance of LLMs in applications that require structured information. This could mark a significant advancement in AI applications, making them more interpretable and integrative with knowledge representation systems. #### Strengths: - The proposed method demonstrates solid empirical results, outperforming existing alternatives in key performance areas. - It addresses a critical gap in the integration of structured and unstructured data, which is essential for advanced AI applications. - The reduction of token usage is a practical innovation that could improve efficiency across various LLM applications. #### Weaknesses: - The paper may lack comprehensive long-term evaluations of the proposed approach across varied contexts beyond those tested. A diverse set of benchmarks could provide a clearer picture of its portability and robustness. - There is limited exploration of potential limitations or trade-offs associated with using quantized representations, which would benefit a more balanced presentation of the method's applicability. Given these considerations, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field by presenting a novel methodology that enhances the integration of knowledge graphs with large language models, marking it as an important read for researchers in this domain. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Wanlong Liu, Yichen Xiao, Dingyi Zeng, Hongyang Zhao, Wenyu Chen, Malu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for deploying large language models (LLMs) within resource-limited settings by significantly reducing resource demands. However, existing PTQ strategies underperform at low bit levels < 3 bits due to the significant difference between the quantized and original weights. To enhance the quantization performance at low bit widths, we introduce a Mixed-precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) approach, employing a graph neural network (GNN) module to capture dependencies among weights and adaptively assign quantization bit-widths. Through the information propagation of the GNN module, our method more effectively captures dependencies among target weights, leading to a more accurate assessment of weight importance and optimized allocation of quantization strategies. Extensive experiments on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets demonstrate that our MG-PTQ method outperforms previous state-of-the-art PTQ method GPTQ, setting new benchmarks for quantization performance under low-bit conditions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Mixed-Precision Graph Neural Quantization for Low Bit Large Language Models" presents a novel approach to Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) aimed at improving the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments. Existing PTQ methods struggle at quantization levels lower than 3 bits due to poor alignment between quantized and original weights. The authors propose a Mixed-precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) that leverages a Graph Neural Network (GNN) module to understand weight dependencies and to assign bit-widths adaptively. This GNN facilitates better information propagation, leading to a more informed assessment of weight importance and a strategic quantization allocation. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, specifically the state-of-the-art GPTQ, on datasets such as WikiText2 and C4. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a significant advancement in the field of quantization for LLMs by addressing a critical limitation in existing low-bit PTQ methods. By employing GNNs, the authors tackle the challenge of dependency awareness among weights, which is often overlooked in traditional quantization frameworks. This approach is innovative as it merges graph neural networks with quantization strategies, potentially leading to more effective resource utilization without severely sacrificing model performance.  Furthermore, the empirical results indicating improvements over state-of-the-art approaches (like GPTQ) suggest that the proposed MG-PTQ method could set new precedents in practical applications of LLMs, particularly in environments with strict hardware constraints. This could inspire further research into hybrid methodologies combining neural architectures for optimizing model performance across a variety of tasks and resource conditions. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of GNNs into the quantization process provides a novel mechanism for addressing weight dependency, a gap in traditional methods. 2. **Strong Experimental Validation:** The authors support their claims with comprehensive experimentation on established datasets, showing tangible improvements. 3. **Timeliness:** As deploying LLMs becomes more common, the need for efficient quantization techniques is increasingly relevant. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Experimentation:** While the paper presents improvements, it is crucial to explore the implications of mixed precision quantization across varied tasks and models beyond the selected datasets. 2. **Complexity and Usability:** Implementing GNN-based solutions may pose implementation challenges, which may limit accessibility to practitioners who lack expertise in these methods. 3. **Comparison with Other Methods:** Further comparisons with a broader range of existing techniques beyond GPTQ could provide a more comprehensive view of MG-PTQ’s relative effectiveness. In sum, this paper makes a valuable contribution to the quantization landscape for LLMs, especially at low bit levels. It offers a new framework that could inspire further innovations and applications. However, its impact might be somewhat constrained by the complexity of the proposed method and the need for broader validation across different contexts. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yuchen Lei, Yuexin Xiang, Qin Wang, Rafael Dowsley, Tsz Hon Yuen, Jiangshan Yu
- **Abstract**: Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study" explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Bitcoin transaction graphs, addressing the limitations of current opaque, black-box models that lack interpretability. The authors propose a three-tiered framework encompassing foundational metrics, a characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation, showcasing a novel human-readable format for representing transaction graphs called LLM4TG, as well as a new connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm called CETraS, which facilitates the simplification of complex transaction graphs. The experimental findings indicate that LLMs perform well on foundational metrics and provide valuable characteristic summaries, while their ability for contextual interpretation can yield insightful explanations of transaction behaviors, even when labeled data is scarce. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contributions**:  The study presents an innovative approach by leveraging LLMs for transactional data analysis in cryptocurrencies, which is a relatively underexplored area given the rapid adoption and complexity of such digital assets. The introduction of a structured framework (the three-tiered approach) and unique tools (LLM4TG and CETraS) for representing and sampling transaction data contributes to the research landscape by improving interpretability and accessibility of data analysis within this context. This approach could significantly influence both academic research and practical applications in understanding cryptocurrency behaviors and patterns. **Strengths**: 1. **Interactivity and Interpretability**: LLMs offer a level of interpretability that is critical for understanding complex behaviors in cryptocurrency transactions. 2. **Practical Implications**: The frameworks and methodologies introduced could be applied in real-time analytics, which enhances their applicability to blockchain technology. 3. **Robust Evaluation**: The experimental results provide solid evidence supporting the effectiveness of LLMs in this new domain, which adds credibility to their assertions. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Scope**: The study is focused solely on Bitcoin, which may limit the generalizability of the findings across other cryptocurrencies with different behavioral patterns and transaction structures. 2. **Lack of Extensive Testing**: While the authors describe successful experimental outcomes, there is little information about the variety of scenarios tested or any potential limitations in real-world application. 3. **Potential Overreliance on LLMs**: There is a risk of overestimating LLM capabilities, particularly if they are found to lack robustness under certain conditions or transaction anomalies. ### Conclusion In conclusion, this paper makes a significant advancement in cryptocurrency transaction analysis by applying LLMs, providing both theoretical and practical contributions to the field. However, its focus on a single currency and potential limitations in testing might restrict broader applicability.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, acknowledging both the innovative use of LLMs and the need for further exploration across diverse cryptocurrencies and scenarios for improved generalizability and robustness.

- **Authors**: Jinyao Guo, Chengpeng Wang, Xiangzhe Xu, Zian Su, Xiangyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code auditing is a code review process with the goal of finding bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial potential in this task, offering the ability to analyze programs without compilation and enabling customized bug detection following specified prompts. However, applying LLMs to repository-level code auditing presents notable challenges. The inherent context limits and hallucinations of LLMs can lead to the low quality of bug reports. Meanwhile, the large size of software repositories introduces substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios. This work introduces an autonomous LLM-agent, RepoAudit, designed to enable precise and efficient repository-level code auditing. Equipped with the agent memory, RepoAudit explores the code repository on demand, analyzing data-flow facts along different feasible program paths in individual functions. It also introduces the validator to check the data-flow facts for hallucination mitigation and examine the satisfiability of path conditions of potential buggy paths, which enables RepoAudit to discard false positives in the code auditing. Our experiment shows that RepoAudit powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet successfully finds 38 true bugs in 15 real-world systems, consuming 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project on average.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents RepoAudit, an autonomous LLM-agent aimed at enhancing repository-level code auditing. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in identifying bugs during code reviews, challenges such as context limits and hallucinations can hinder their effectiveness, especially in large software repositories. RepoAudit addresses these issues by employing an agent memory that facilitates on-demand exploration of code repositories, allowing for the analysis of data-flow facts across various program paths. It includes a validator to verify data-flow facts and assess the plausibility of buggy paths, thus reducing false positives in auditing. Experiments indicate that RepoAudit, leveraging Claude 3.5 Sonnet, successfully identified 38 genuine bugs across 15 real-world systems with minimal time and cost. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** RepoAudit introduces a significant enhancement to the application of LLMs in code auditing by integrating a memory mechanism and a validator to mitigate common issues such as hallucinations and improper context utilization. The innovation of adapting LLMs specifically for repository-level analysis, rather than individual files or snippets, marks a notable progression in the software analysis landscape. The proposed system successfully reduces false positives while providing efficient auditing capabilities, which is critical given the often large size of software repositories. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of agent memory and a validation mechanism is a novel contribution to improving the reliability of LLMs for bug detection in large codebases. 2. **Practical Application:** Demonstrating the efficacy of RepoAudit through empirical testing on real-world systems underscores its practicality and readiness for implementation. 3. **Efficient Resource Use:** The ability to find numerous bugs in a short amount of time and at a low cost demonstrates RepoAudit's potential for real-world scalability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Context on Results:** The evaluation statistics, while promising, do not provide insights into the false positive rate or the granularity of the bug findings, which is important for evaluating the robustness of the tool. 2. **Dependence on LLMs:** The inherent limitations of LLMs, such as their tendency to hallucinate, still exist and could impact the reliability of bug detection in more complex scenarios beyond those tested. 3. **Generality in Application:** The method's dependence on recent models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) raises concerns about its applicability as model architectures evolve, potentially limiting longevity and adaptability. **Potential Influence:** The approach taken by RepoAudit can influence future research into the intersection of LLMs and automated code auditing. If further refinement and validation can address some of its limitations, RepoAudit could lead to wider adoption of LLMs in software engineering tasks. **Score: 8** The paper showcases a clear advancement in the field of code auditing using LLMs, exhibiting both creativity and practical application. However, the reliance on specific models and the lack of comprehensive evaluation regarding false positives present concerns that prevent a higher score. Overall, RepoAudit demonstrates significant promise and innovation but requires further development to ascertain its full potential.

### Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18177v1)
- **Authors**: Teddy Lazebnik, Labib Shami
- **Abstract**: Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a persistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications. Many socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing factors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the tax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as observed in the real world, neglecting the "big bang" of such activity in a population. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in computer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy appearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel computational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the emergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation powered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework is uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge organically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling agents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for exploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The experimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases, demonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic behaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal economic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is sufficient to curtail informal activity effectively.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation" addresses the long-standing issue of tax evasion as a crucial element of the informal economy. Unlike previous studies that treated tax evasion behaviors as static, this research introduces a computational framework that allows these behaviors to emerge naturally through agent-based simulation powered by advanced AI techniques, including Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning. This novel methodology provides insights into the socio-economic factors influencing tax compliance and the spread of informal economic activities. Key findings highlight the significance of individuals' personality traits, prevailing narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the public perception of the efficiency of public goods provision in shaping tax evasion behaviors. The study concludes with the assertion that effective public service delivery and stringent enforcement efforts are necessary but must work in tandem to mitigate informal economic activites. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the study of tax evasion by moving beyond conventional methods that often rely on predefined behaviors. Its novelty lies in the integration of advanced AI technologies, which facilitate the organic emergence of tax evasion behaviors within an agent-based framework. This represents a shift toward a more dynamic approach to understanding informal economies, which could lead to more effective policy formulations. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of dual Large Language Models combined with Deep Reinforcement Learning distinguishes this research from traditional studies that typically rely on static assumptions about taxpayer behavior.     2. **Empirical Validation**: The framework demonstrated robustness through model validation and exploratory phases, showcasing its potential for replication of theoretical economic behaviors. 3. **Broader Insights**: The findings regarding personality traits, narratives, and public goods provision provide rich qualitative data that can be beneficial for policymakers in crafting more responsive tax regulations. Weaknesses: 1. **Complexity and Accessibility**: The use of advanced AI methods may limit accessibility for researchers less versed in these areas, potentially hindering the paper's influence within broader economics research communities.     2. **Generalizability**: While the study identifies key determinants of tax evasion, the outcomes may be context-specific due to variations in cultural, socio-economic, and governmental structures across different regions. 3. **Dependence on Model Parameters**: The emergent properties of the simulation may be highly sensitive to initial parameters and assumptions, raising questions about the robustness of findings when applied to real-world scenarios. **Overall Assessment**: The blend of AI with socio-economic modeling presents a pioneering approach with meaningful implications for tax policy research. However, challenges around complexity and generalizability may temper its immediate impact. Therefore, the paper earns a commendable score reflecting its innovative character and contributions while acknowledging areas for further exploration and accessibility within the field. Score: 8

### In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18187v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyuan Sun, Ali Jadbabaie, Navid Azizan
- **Abstract**: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable ability in in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a prompt with a few examples, without requiring parameter updates. Recent research has provided insight into how linear Transformers can perform ICL by implementing gradient descent estimators. In particular, it has been shown that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent with respect to a linear least-squares objective when trained on random linear regression tasks. However, the theoretical understanding of ICL for nonlinear function classes remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by first showing that LSA is inherently restricted to solving linear least-squares objectives and thus, the solutions in prior works cannot readily extend to nonlinear ICL tasks. To overcome this limitation, drawing inspiration from modern architectures, we study a mechanism that combines LSA with GLU-like feed-forward layers and show that this allows the model to perform one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression. Further, we characterize the scaling behavior of the resulting Transformer model, highlighting the necessary model size to effectively handle quadratic ICL tasks. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of attention and feed-forward layers in nonlinear ICL and identify key challenges when extending ICL to nonlinear function classes.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers" explores the limitations of linear self-attention (LSA) in achieving in-context learning (ICL) for nonlinear tasks. While previous work has demonstrated the ability of LSA to perform nonlinear regression tasks, the authors show that LSA is fundamentally constrained to linear objectives. To address this, they introduce a hybrid mechanism that integrates LSA with Gated Linear Units (GLU)-like layers, enabling the model to execute gradient descent steps for polynomial kernel regression. Through their findings, they also analyze the scaling behavior of the improved architecture, clarifying the model size necessary for effective performance on quadratic ICL tasks. The study contributes to understanding the unique functionalities of attention and feed-forward layers in the context of nonlinear ICL and emphasizes the challenges of extending ICL to nonlinear functions. **Evaluation:** The paper presents novel insights into the limitations of existing Transformer architectures in the realm of ICL, particularly when transitioning from linear to nonlinear tasks. By proposing a new model architecture that incorporates GLU layers, the authors are pushing the boundaries of current knowledge and methodologies in the field. This blend of LSA and GLU mechanisms tackles an important gap in the understanding of ICL performance, which is critical as the demand for proficiency in various nonlinear function approximations grows. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contribution**: By clarifying the restrictions of LSA, the authors lay a foundational understanding essential for advancing ICL research. 2. **Practical Methodology**: The introduction of GLU layers as a means to enhance LSA shows a creative application of existing architectures to solve a pressing challenge. 3. **Scalability Analysis**: The characterization of model size requirements adds practical value for researchers and practitioners interested in implementing these techniques. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: The implementation of GLU layers adds complexity to the architecture, which may hinder usability compared to simpler approaches. 2. **Limited Scope**: While addressing polynomial regression, the paper does not explore other nonlinearities, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. 3. **Experimental Validation**: The paper's depth of empirical validation concerning the proposed model's performance compared to existing methods remains unclear; enhancements in this area could significantly bolster the impact. Overall, the paper represents a noteworthy advance in the understanding of in-context learning with Transformers, especially in accounting for nonlinear dependencies. However, its practical application and immediate utility may be tempered by the limitations of complexity and scope. **Score: 7**  This score reflects solid contributions to the field of ICL while acknowledging areas where the paper could further broaden its impact and clarity. The innovative approach and theoretical grounding are commendable, but the execution and scope leave room for improvement.

### Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v1)
- **Authors**: James Blades, Frederick Somerfield, William Langley, Susan Everingham, Maurice Witherington
- **Abstract**: Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models" presents a novel method for token representation in large neural architectures by incorporating structured relationships into embedding initialization. While traditional models use self-attention mechanisms to capture contextual dependencies, they often overlook long-range hierarchical structures within token interactions. The authors propose a dependency-aware token encoding approach that refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention, which retains syntactic and semantic dependencies through multiple processing layers. Empirical results demonstrate a reduction in perplexity across various linguistic benchmarks, indicating improved contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Furthermore, the method shows enhanced lexical variation and better dependency retention without relying on external syntactic annotations, demonstrating its effectiveness especially in longer sequences where conventional models tend to struggle. While there is a moderate increase in memory usage and training time, the method is shown to be scalable within standard transformer architectures. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a key gap in the current understanding of token representation and emphasizes the importance of structured relational dependencies, which is a critical aspect of syntactic understanding in natural language processing (NLP). 2. **Technical Approach:** The introduction of a dependency-aware mechanism within the transformer architecture is innovative and presents a clear progression over conventional self-attention methods. This structural innovation could lead to future enhancements in language model performance. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides empirical evidence of improvements in various linguistic benchmarks, supporting the claims made about the efficacy of the proposed approach. The emphasis on reducing perplexity and enhancing lexical coherence is particularly relevant for applications in autoregressive models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Computational Cost:** The moderate increase in memory and training time may present a barrier to practical application, especially in environments where computational resources are limited. The trade-off between performance gains and computational costs should be better quantified. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** While the improvements are noted, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive comparative analysis against state-of-the-art models. Understanding how the proposed method performs relative to other advanced architectures would strengthen the case for its adoption. 3. **Broad Applicability:** The applicability of this method across diverse languages and domains remains undertested. The findings may be more pertinent to certain linguistic structures while potentially less effective for others. **Influence on the Field:** The proposed encoding mechanism has the potential to influence future research directions in NLP by highlighting the necessity of incorporating structured dependencies in token representations. If further validated across various datasets and tasks, this approach may set a precedent for new architectures focused on enhancing syntactic coherence in generated language. Given these considerations, the paper demonstrates significant contributions to the field of NLP and could pave the way for more sophisticated model architectures that leverage structured dependencies explicitly. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial novelty and relevance but also acknowledges the need for further exploration of its practical implications and comparative performance.

- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Li, Chunlong Sun, Xiangcheng Zheng
- **Abstract**: This work investigates both direct and inverse problems of the variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which attracts increasing attentions in both practical applications and theoretical aspects. Based on the perturbation method, which transfers the original model to an equivalent but more tractable form, the analytical extensibility of the solutions and the weak unique continuation principle are proved, which results in the uniqueness of the inverse space-dependent source problem from local internal observation. Then, based on the variational identity connecting the inversion input data with the unknown source function, we propose a weak norm and prove the conditional stability for the inverse problem in this norm. The iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are employed to numerically reconstruct the smooth and non-smooth sources, respectively. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate their effectiveness.

Utilizing a perturbation method, the authors reformulate the original problem into a more manageable form. They establish the analytical extensibility of solutions and demonstrate a weak unique continuation principle, thereby proving that the inverse space-dependent source problem is uniquely solvable with local internal observations. The authors connect the inversion data with the unknown source function through a variational identity and propose a weak norm to prove stability conditions for the inverse problem. For numerical reconstruction, an iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are used to recover both smooth and non-smooth sources, and numerical experiments illustrate their effectiveness. **Critical Evaluation:** Novelty: The paper presents a significant advancement in the understanding of variable-exponent sub-diffusion processes, particularly in its methodical approach to the inverse source problem. It innovates by establishing conditions for the uniqueness of solutions and providing a framework for reconstructing sources using the perturbation method and variational techniques. These contributions offer a fresh perspective on an area that has garnered increasing interest. However, the core ideas of source identification and stability are established concepts in inverse problems, which slightly temper the novelty. Significance: The results have practical implications, especially in fields where sub-diffusion processes are relevant, such as in materials science and biomedical applications. By addressing both smooth and non-smooth source reconstruction, the paper caters to a broader range of applications, reinforcing its importance in both theoretical and applied contexts.

Weaknesses:  - The paper could benefit from a more extensive review of existing literature on similar problems to better contextualize its contributions and clarify its distinctiveness. - While numerical experiments validate the proposed approaches, more extensive studies across diverse scenarios would strengthen the claims regarding the methods' effectiveness and robustness. Overall, the paper provides a noteworthy contribution to the field of inverse problems in sub-diffusion processes, with significant potential for influencing further research.

- **Abstract**: Rapid progress in text-to-motion generation has been largely driven by diffusion models. However, existing methods focus solely on temporal modeling, thereby overlooking frequency-domain analysis. We identify two key phases in motion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained improving stage**. To address these phases effectively, we propose **Fre**quency **e**nhanced **t**ext-**to**-**m**otion diffusion model (**Free-T2M**), incorporating stage-specific consistency losses that enhance the robustness of static features and improve fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on StableMoFusion, our method reduces the FID from **0.189** to **0.051**, establishing a new SOTA performance within the diffusion architecture. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating frequency-domain insights into text-to-motion generation for more precise and robust results.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled **Free-T2M: Frequency Enhanced Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model With Consistency Loss** addresses limitations in current text-to-motion generation techniques which primarily focus on temporal aspects while neglecting frequency-domain analysis. The authors propose a novel model named **Free-T2M**, which introduces stage-specific consistency losses aimed at two critical phases in motion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained improving stage**. By enhancing robustness in static feature representation and improving accuracy in detailed motion generation, Free-T2M significantly improves performance as evidenced by experiments conducted on StableMoFusion, reducing the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) from **0.189** to **0.051**. This advancement sets a new state-of-the-art performance within the diffusion model framework, emphasizing the necessity of frequency-domain considerations in achieving precise and robust text-to-motion outputs. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**   The introduction of frequency-domain analysis into text-to-motion generation presents a fresh perspective that is underexplored in existing literature. The identification of two distinct phases—semantic planning and fine-grained improving—represents a significant advancement in understanding the intricacies of motion denoising. The proposed stage-specific consistency losses are innovative and provide a clear methodological contribution to the field, aligning well with the identified needs. **Strengths**   1. **Innovative Approach**: Integrating frequency-domain insights is a novel direction that could inspire future research in various generative models, not just in motion generation. 2. **Strong Empirical Results**: The paper reports a significant reduction in FID, which is a recognized metric for evaluating generative models, demonstrating the practical efficacy of the proposed model. 3. **Clear Structure**: The identification of the two phases in motion denoising gives a clear framework within which other researchers can operate or build upon. **Weaknesses**   1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the results on StableMoFusion are impressive, broader evaluations across different datasets and scenarios would bolster the claims of robustness and generalizability. 2. **Potential Overfitting Risk**: The significant drop in FID could raise questions about overfitting if the model has been tuned excessively to specific characteristics of the benchmark dataset. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: There is a need for a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art methods to contextualize the improvement thoroughly. **Conclusion**   The paper offers an important step forward in text-to-motion generation by introducing frequency analysis and dual-phase considerations. However, while the advancements are notable, additional validation through diverse evaluations and comparative benchmarks would further solidify its impact. Therefore, the signified contributions, while fresh and potentially influential, call for careful consideration in the context of wider applicability. **Score: 8**   The score reflects a strong contribution to the field with noteworthy innovations but also acknowledges the need for broader validation to fully confirm its robustness and applicability.

- **Abstract**: A patient undergoes multiple examinations in each hospital stay, where each provides different facets of the health status. These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training. The source code will be made publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces an innovative method for integrating diverse types of patient data (including temporal records, discrete measurements, and images) into a unified format for analysis using Vision Transformers, specifically through an approach called ViTiMM (Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements). This method leverages the ability to visualize all patient data as images and unstructured text, allowing a conventional vision-text transformer to process the information. The authors demonstrate that this technique simplifies the modeling and training complexities traditionally associated with multi-modal data, simultaneously enhancing performance on critical healthcare tasks such as predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated with a dataset of 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV database. The research not only presents improved predictive accuracy but also aims to democratize access to multi-modal medical AI by lowering the barriers required for effective model training. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing Complexity:** The reduction of complexity in training models for multi-modal data is a significant contribution that can make AI more accessible to healthcare practitioners and researchers without specialized backgrounds in data science or machine learning. 2. **Performance Gains:** The demonstrated performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods suggest that the proposed approach offers tangible benefits beyond mere theoretical claims. 3. **Public Availability of Code:** The commitment to making the source code available enhances the potential for further research and application in the field, promoting collaboration and innovation by allowing others to build on the work. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the paper demonstrates effectiveness using the MIMIC-IV dataset, the generalizability of the ViTiMM model across different healthcare systems or patient populations may need further validation. The dataset is limited to specific types of clinical data, potentially impacting the robustness of the findings. 2. **Lack of Methods Comparison Detail:** The paper lacks a comprehensive comparison of ViTiMM against specific existing methods beyond mentioning that it outperforms current approaches. More detailed benchmarks would provide a clearer context for its advantage. 3. **Ethical and Practical Concerns:** The paper could explore ethical implications and practical challenges of implementing such AI in real clinical settings. Issues like data privacy, biases in model training, and implications of incorrect predictions warrant discussion. **Influence on the Field:** The approach proposed could revolutionize multi-modal data integration in healthcare by making advanced AI tools more user-friendly. By redefining how patient data can be processed, it could encourage broader adoption of AI in clinical workflows. However, the critique regarding generalizability and the need for ethical considerations are important to ensure that such advancements lead to equitable healthcare solutions. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's substantial novelty and potential impact in simplifying multi-modal data integration within healthcare AI. Although there are useful strengths, especially regarding accessibility and initial performance improvements, the limitations regarding generalizability and insufficient detail on comparative performance prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

### MAMS: Model-Agnostic Module Selection Framework for Video Captioning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18269v1)
- **Authors**: Sangho Lee, Il Yong Chun, Hogun Park
- **Abstract**: Multi-modal transformers are rapidly gaining attention in video captioning tasks. Existing multi-modal video captioning methods typically extract a fixed number of frames, which raises critical challenges. When a limited number of frames are extracted, important frames with essential information for caption generation may be missed. Conversely, extracting an excessive number of frames includes consecutive frames, potentially causing redundancy in visual tokens extracted from consecutive video frames. To extract an appropriate number of frames for each video, this paper proposes the first model-agnostic module selection framework in video captioning that has two main functions: (1) selecting a caption generation module with an appropriate size based on visual tokens extracted from video frames, and (2) constructing subsets of visual tokens for the selected caption generation module. Furthermore, we propose a new adaptive attention masking scheme that enhances attention on important visual tokens. Our experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of three recent video captioning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "MAMS: Model-Agnostic Module Selection Framework for Video Captioning" addresses the challenges in video captioning caused by the fixed number of video frames extracted for processing. It introduces a novel model-agnostic framework that enhances the caption generation process by (1) selecting an appropriate caption generation module size based on the number of visual tokens extracted from video frames, and (2) building specific subsets of visual tokens tailored for the chosen module. The framework incorporates an adaptive attention masking scheme aimed at emphasizing significant visual tokens. Experimental results across three benchmark datasets indicate a substantial performance enhancement for three recent video captioning models due to the proposed methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its focus on a model-agnostic approach to frame selection and module adaptation for video captioning. This is significant as it addresses the common pitfalls associated with fixed frame extraction, such as information loss or redundancy from consecutive frames. Additionally, the integration of an adaptive attention masking scheme is a noteworthy contribution, as it refines the model’s focus on the most pertinent visual features during caption generation. However, there are several aspects to consider. While the framework is indeed innovative, its practical applicability may depend on how well it integrates with existing models across diverse datasets and video types. Furthermore, the paper does not thoroughly elucidate its limitations or potential scenarios where the framework may fail. The robustness of the findings isn't fully supported by extensive experimentation across varied contexts, which raises questions about generalizability. Moreover, while there is a clear performance improvement, the paper could provide additional insight into the computational complexity introduced by the MAMS framework compared to traditional approaches, as the increased flexibility may come at a cost in terms of speed and efficiency. In summary, the contribution is meaningful and timely in advancing video captioning techniques, but the practical integration and thorough exploration of limitations are somewhat lacking. Given these considerations, I assign a score of 7. **Score: 7**

### Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyu Liang, Youran Sun, Yunfeng Cai, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang
- **Abstract**: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models" addresses the security vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) by investigating how text embedding models can be exploited. The authors identify a considerable bias in the output distributions of these embedding models with a high mean and propose a method to discover "universal magic words." These magic words, when used as suffixes in user prompts or responses from LLMs, can shift the text embeddings towards the biased direction, thus enabling attackers to bypass safeguards designed to prevent harmful outputs. To counter this manipulation, the authors suggest train-free defense mechanisms aimed at correcting the biased distributions of the text embeddings. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Timely and Relevant Research:**    The paper addresses a crucial aspect of AI safety, especially as LLMs become more widely used in sensitive applications. The exploration of vulnerabilities exposes gaps in current safeguarding mechanisms. 2. **Empirical Foundation:**    The research is based on empirical testing, leading to the identification of biased output distributions, which enhances the credibility of the claims. 3. **Innovative Solutions:**    The introduction of "universal magic words" serves as a novel approach to attack text embedding models and highlights a specific method by which a prevalent issue can be exploited. 4. **Defense Mechanisms Proposed:**    The provision of train-free methods to address the bias presents a practical contribution to the field, suggesting that researchers and practitioners can implement these defenses without extensive retraining of models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:**    While the identification of magic words is innovative, the study may lack comprehensive analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed defense mechanisms across diverse application scenarios, leading to questions about their generalizability. 2. **Ethical Considerations:**    Engaging in research that demonstrates weaknesses in security can lead to potential misuse or ethical concerns regarding the dissemination of such findings without adequate safeguards. 3. **Technical Depth:**    The paper could benefit from more in-depth technical details on the methodology used for finding magic words and the evaluation metrics for both successful attacks and defensive measures. 4. **Impact on Long-term security:**    It remains unclear how the proposed defenses will hold up as both attack methods and embedding technologies evolve, possibly diminishing the paper's long-term relevance. **Overall Impact:** The paper contributes significantly to understanding the vulnerabilities of text embedding models within LLMs, making a pivotal step in AI safety research. However, the concerns regarding the depth of analysis and potential ethical implications slightly detract from its overall impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's importance in highlighting vulnerabilities and proposing novel defenses while recognizing the limitations in depth and potential ethical challenges associated with disclosure of security flaws.

- **Abstract**: This paper presents an exploratory study that harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to mine key ecological entities from invasion biology literature. Specifically, we focus on extracting species names, their locations, associated habitats, and ecosystems, information that is critical for understanding species spread, predicting future invasions, and informing conservation efforts. Traditional text mining approaches often struggle with the complexity of ecological terminology and the subtle linguistic patterns found in these texts. By applying general-purpose LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning, we uncover both the promise and limitations of using these models for ecological entity extraction. In doing so, this study lays the groundwork for more advanced, automated knowledge extraction tools that can aid researchers and practitioners in understanding and managing biological invasions.

- **Authors**: Tianpeng Pan, Wenqiang Pu, Licheng Zhao, Rui Zhou
- **Abstract**: Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach" addresses the limitations of existing automated optimization modeling (AOM) techniques in sensor array signal processing (SASP) due to inadequate domain knowledge. The authors propose a novel approach, MAG-RAG, which combines a multi-agent (MA) structure modeled after human procedures with a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-RAG) process. This structure allows for better alignment of user queries with SASP-specific knowledge, potentially leading to improved modeling results. Experimental evaluations on ten classical signal processing problems indicate that MAG-RAG outperforms several existing AOM benchmarks, suggesting its effectiveness in enhancing optimization modeling tasks. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of this paper lies in its hybrid approach of integrating multi-agent systems with retrieval-augmented generation tailored specifically to meet the challenges present in SASP problems. This is significant as many existing LLM applications rely heavily on generic prompt engineering, which often falls short in specialized domains such as SASP. By addressing the gap in domain-specific optimization modeling, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse in both machine learning and signal processing fields. Strengths: - **Innovative Approach:** The combination of multi-agent architecture with a graph-based RAG showcases a noteworthy advancement in how LLM capabilities can be tailored for specialized applications. - **Empirical Validation:** The rigorous testing across ten classical problems demonstrates practical applicability and informs about real-world usage. - **Field Relevance:** It emphasizes the growing intersection of AI and domain-specific applications, which is increasingly important in a data-driven world. Weaknesses: - **Scalability Concerns:** The paper does not thoroughly address how well the proposed model may scale to more complex or diverse SASP problems beyond the tested cases. - **Implementation Details:** While the theoretical framework is well laid out, there may be insufficient detail on the practical implementation aspects, which could limit reproducibility. Given these considerations, the paper has made a commendable contribution to the field. However, without substantial evidence on scalability and detailed implementation guidelines, it may have limitations in broader applicability. **Score: 8**  This score reflects recognition of the innovative method presented, solid empirical backing, and its relevance to an impactful field, tempered by concerns about scalability and implementation that need to be addressed for maximal influence in both academia and industry.

### A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18322v1)
- **Authors**: Valérie Castin, Pierre Ablin, José Antonio Carrillo, Gabriel Peyré
- **Abstract**: Transformers, which are state-of-the-art in most machine learning tasks, represent the data as sequences of vectors called tokens. This representation is then exploited by the attention function, which learns dependencies between tokens and is key to the success of Transformers. However, the iterative application of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to be fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence with a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called Transformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure. Our first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We show the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis to several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention, Sinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a conditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the first to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on Gaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the Transformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to analyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical behaviors. This Gaussian analysis captures the evolution of data anisotropy through a deep Transformer. In particular, we highlight a clustering phenomenon that parallels previous results in the non-normalized discrete case.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers" investigates the underlying dynamics of Transformer architectures, which have shown exceptional performance across various machine learning tasks. The authors model the evolution of input sequences using a probability measure, expressing it through a Vlasov equation termed the Transformer PDE. This PDE framework allows for analyzing the dynamics of self-attention mechanisms, including multi-head and various specialized attention types. The first significant contribution demonstrates that the Transformer PDE is well-posed for compactly supported initial conditions and serves as the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, extending existing analyses of self-attention. The authors further explore non-compactly supported initial conditions, particularly Gaussian data, showing that the Transformer PDE preserves the Gaussian measure space. This enables both theoretical and numerical analysis of the model's behavior, particularly highlighting the data's anisotropic evolution and a clustering phenomenon akin to findings in discrete cases. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper stems principally from its approach to framing Transformer dynamics through the lens of the Vlasov equation and the Transformer PDE, which offers a new perspective that bridges probabilistic and statistical mechanics with deep learning architectures. This theoretical foundation enhances our understanding of the non-linear interactions in Transformers, making significant contributions to the field, especially in analyzing various attention mechanisms. Strengths: - The theoretical underpinnings provided by the use of the Vlasov equation offer a robust framework for analyzing complex interactions in Transformers, differentiating it from previous studies that may lack this depth. - The examination of both compactly and non-compactly supported initial conditions shows a comprehensive treatment of the subject. - The preservation of Gaussian measures allows for clear theoretical and numerical insights into the behavior of Transformers, which can inform future research directions. Weaknesses: - While the framework is insightful, the direct practical implications of the theoretical findings on the performance or efficiency of Transformers might not be immediately clear or applicable. - The paper’s complex mathematical apparatus might alienate practitioners or researchers who are more focused on empirical applications rather than theoretical investigations. - The analysis focuses on a narrow set of initial conditions (Gaussian), which, while informative, may not capture the full range of behaviors seen in diverse datasets. Overall, the paper contributes a significant theoretical advancement to understanding Transformer dynamics, enhancing both the theoretical landscape and practical considerations for researchers in deep learning. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial novelty and importance in contributing to the theoretical understanding of Transformers while acknowledging that its practical implications might need further exploration. The integration of theoretical mathematics with deep learning represents a crucial cross-pollination that could lead to significant future developments, but the complexities involved may limit its accessibility.

- **Authors**: Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge base. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the reliability of both the retriever and the knowledge base. In real-world scenarios, imperfections in these components often lead to the retrieval of noisy, irrelevant, or misleading counterfactual information, ultimately undermining the trustworthiness of RAG systems. To address this challenge, we propose Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT), a method designed to enhance the resilience of LLMs against retrieval defects through two targeted fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RbFT significantly improves the robustness of RAG systems across diverse retrieval conditions, surpassing existing methods while maintaining high inference efficiency and compatibility with other robustness techniques.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "RbFT: Robust Fine-tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation against Retrieval Defects" discusses a critical issue in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. The authors identify that the effectiveness of RAG systems is often compromised by the unreliability of both the retriever and the knowledge base, leading to challenges such as the retrieval of noisy or misleading information. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a novel method called Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT), which focuses on enhancing the resilience of LLMs through two specific fine-tuning tasks. The results indicate that RbFT significantly improves the robustness of RAG systems in various retrieval scenarios, outpacing existing methodologies while also being efficient and compatible with other robustness-enhancing strategies. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The concept of fine-tuning LLMs to make them more resilient against defects in retrieval systems is quite novel, particularly in the context of RAG. The integration of external knowledge is becoming increasingly common, and addressing the inherent flaws in retrieval processes is critical for practical applications. Conventional methods often overlook the need for robustness against incorrect information retrieval, which underpins the innovation represented by RbFT. Thus, the novel aspect lies in explicitly targeting the weaknesses of RAG systems through the proposed fine-tuning tasks. **Significance:** The significance of RbFT is arguably high given its potential impact on the reliability and trustworthiness of LAG systems, which are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. By enhancing the robustness of these systems, the research contributes to the stability and performance of LLMs in various tasks, such as conversational AI, information retrieval, and more. If widely adopted, RbFT may set a new standard for how LLMs handle external knowledge sources. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposal of RbFT introduces a strategic way to enhance the robustness of LLMs, filling an important gap in existing literature. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides experimental evidence demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method, which is crucial for establishing validity. 3. **Maintaining Efficiency:** The retention of inference efficiency and compatibility with other robustness strategies is a notable strength, as it addresses practical concerns about deploying such systems. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the results are promising, the paper could provide more diverse scenarios, including real-world applications to better demonstrate the versatility of RbFT. 2. **Generality of Results:** It would be beneficial to discuss the generalization of the results across different domains and types of knowledge bases. 3. **Potential for Overfitting:** The fine-tuning process, while useful, could potentially lead to overfitting if not handled carefully, and this risk should be acknowledged and mitigated. In summary, while the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field, areas for future work remain, particularly concerning the broader applicability of the proposed methods and exploration of potential limitations. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a commendable balance of novelty and significance, with some reservations regarding the breadth and generalizability of the findings. The paper advances an important line of inquiry and has potential practical implications, warranting a strong but not exceptional score in the context of current research trends.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18373v1)
- **Authors**: Tyler Ingebrand, Adam J. Thorpe, Ufuk Topcu
- **Abstract**: A central challenge in transfer learning is designing algorithms that can quickly adapt and generalize to new tasks without retraining. Yet, the conditions of when and how algorithms can effectively transfer to new tasks is poorly characterized. We introduce a geometric characterization of transfer in Hilbert spaces and define three types of inductive transfer: interpolation within the convex hull, extrapolation to the linear span, and extrapolation outside the span. We propose a method grounded in the theory of function encoders to achieve all three types of transfer. Specifically, we introduce a novel training scheme for function encoders using least-squares optimization, prove a universal approximation theorem for function encoders, and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing approaches such as transformers and meta-learning on four diverse benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the function encoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark tasks and on all three types of transfer.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Function Encoders: A Principled Approach to Transfer Learning in Hilbert Spaces" addresses a significant challenge in transfer learning—creating algorithms that effectively adapt to new tasks without extensive retraining. It presents a geometric framework for understanding transfer in Hilbert spaces, categorizing transfer into three types: interpolation within the convex hull, extrapolation to the linear span, and extrapolation beyond the span. The authors introduce a novel method based on function encoders and a specific training regime employing least-squares optimization. They prove a universal approximation theorem for the proposed function encoders and contrast their approach with existing methods, such as transformers and meta-learning, across four diverse benchmark tasks. Results indicate that function encoders outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in all scenarios discussed. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its geometric characterization of transfer learning in Hilbert spaces, which is a fresh perspective that informs the design of algorithms. By categorizing transfer in a systematic way and introducing the function encoder framework, the paper deepens the understanding of the conditions under which knowledge can be transferred between tasks. The thought of applying least-squares optimization and proving an approximation theorem adds rigor and theoretical backing to the proposed method. Strengths: 1. **Theoretical Contribution**: The geometric approach provides a valuable foundation for future research in transfer learning, establishing a principle that can be built upon. 2. **Empirical Results**: The experiments demonstrate clear superiority over existing methods, suggesting practical relevance. 3. **Broad Applicability**: Addressing three distinct types of transfer allows the work to appeal to a wide array of applications in machine learning. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Benchmarks**: Although the paper reports strong performance across four benchmarks, the choice of tasks isn't detailed, and their diversity could still be questioned. More extensive evaluation could reinforce the claims. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The proposed method may not be as straightforward to implement as existing solutions (like transformers), potentially hindering practical adoption in certain scenarios. 3. **Transferability**: While the framework is theoretically appealing, it's unclear how well the findings generalize beyond the specific tasks tested. In summary, this paper represents a significant step forward in understanding transfer learning but is somewhat limited in scope regarding real-world applications outside the benchmark tasks tested. The foundational work it provides could stimulate further research in the area, lending it considerable relevance. **Score: 8**

### MatIR: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Image Restoration Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18401v1)
- **Authors**: Juan Wen, Weiyan Hou, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte
- **Abstract**: In recent years, Transformers-based models have made significant progress in the field of image restoration by leveraging their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents MatIR, a hybrid image restoration model that integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models. While Transformers excel in contextual feature learning, Mamba models offer greater computational efficiency and effective handling of long-range dependencies. MatIR arises from the need to synergize these capabilities. It incorporates cross-cycling of Transformer and Mamba blocks to leverage the best of both architectures. The Mamba segment introduces an Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module to efficiently process long sequences through four scanning paths. Concurrently, the Transformer segment implements a novel attention mechanism that combines local triangular window-based attention and channel-based global attention to enhance pixel-based interactions across larger image areas. Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the MatIR model. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty (Score: 7/10)** The novelty of the MatIR model lies primarily in its hybrid design, combining the Mamba architecture with Transformer capabilities to enhance image restoration tasks. While both Mamba and Transformer models have been used separately for image restoration, the direct integration to address deficiencies in either model represents a commendable innovation. The introduction of the IRSS module adds a specific, novel mechanism for processing sequences, which could be beneficial in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. However, the work does not significantly advance theoretical understanding or fundamentally transform the model landscape; rather, it adapts existing concepts in a hybrid manner. There is ample precedent in the literature regarding hybrid architectures, which could undermine the perceived novelty of such integrations. Furthermore, while the experimental results validate the proposed approach, the extent of improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods is vital to ascertain its genuine contribution. **Significance** The significance of MatIR lies in its practical implications for image restoration, an area with substantial demand in applications ranging from photography to medical imaging. By improving computational efficiency while tackling long-range dependencies, MatIR could pave the way for more effective solutions in real-time scenarios. However, further exploration into the limitations and applicability of the hybrid model across various datasets and conditions will be essential to establish its broader impact. **Strengths**: - Combines strengths of both Mamba and Transformer architectures. - Introduces a novel attention mechanism and efficient processing paths. - Empirical evidence through results and ablation studies strengthens the model's validity. **Weaknesses**: - Limited discussion on the theoretical implications or underpinnings of the hybrid approach. - The baseline improvements over existing methodologies could be more explicitly discussed to highlight significance. - Dependency on the established capabilities of both Mamba and Transformer might restrict its applicability if either model falls short in certain contexts. In conclusion, while the MatIR model presents an interesting and useful approach to image restoration, its incremental nature limits the score reflecting its novelty and significance. Nonetheless, it is well-founded in its methodology and applications, warranting a score of 7. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Youngjoon Lee, Taehyun Park, Yunho Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang
- **Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly being adopted in military collaborations to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving data sovereignty. However, prompt injection attacks-malicious manipulations of input prompts-pose new threats that may undermine operational security, disrupt decision-making, and erode trust among allies. This perspective paper highlights four potential vulnerabilities in federated military LLMs: secret data leakage, free-rider exploitation, system disruption, and misinformation spread. To address these potential risks, we propose a human-AI collaborative framework that introduces both technical and policy countermeasures. On the technical side, our framework uses red/blue team wargaming and quality assurance to detect and mitigate adversarial behaviors of shared LLM weights. On the policy side, it promotes joint AI-human policy development and verification of security protocols. Our findings will guide future research and emphasize proactive strategies for emerging military contexts.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "Exploring Potential Prompt Injection Attacks in Federated Military LLMs and Their Mitigation" addresses the emerging risks associated with the use of Federated Learning (FL) in military contexts for developing Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies four critical vulnerabilities that could arise: secret data leakage, exploitation by free-riders, disruption of systems, and the spread of misinformation. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, the authors propose a dual-approach framework that incorporates both technical and policy measures. Technically, it advocates for wargaming simulations to identify adversarial behaviors, while on the policy front, it stresses the importance of AI-human collaboration for crafting security protocols. The paper aims to guide future research directions and emphasize proactive measures for safeguarding military LLM applications. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The exploration of prompt injection attacks in the context of federated learning applied to military LLMs is a relatively niche but important area of research. The authors delve into threats that are not widely explored in the existing literature, particularly in military collaborations, which adds a layer of specificity and relevance. This focus on a hybrid approach—integrating technical measures with policy development—further demonstrates a unique perspective that is not commonly addressed. **Significance:** Given the increasing reliance on AI in military operations, the implications of these findings are significant. The identification of potential threats such as misinformation and system disruptions is crucial for maintaining operational security and trust among allies. The proposed framework for mitigating these risks could influence both future research and practical applications within military contexts. However, the paper's broad claims require empirical validation to strengthen its impact. **Strengths:** 1. **Proactive Approach:** The dual framework introduces practical, novel countermeasures that respond to identified risks. 2. **Focus on Military Context:** This application is particularly relevant as military operations increasingly leverage AI technologies. 3. **Highlighting Underexplored Threats:** The discussion of prompt injection attacks in a federated learning setting is relatively novel and warrants further exploration. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The paper presents theoretical propositions but lacks empirical studies or case examples that could substantiate the claims made about vulnerabilities. 2. **Broadness of Threat Categories:** While the threats identified are relevant, the lack of detailed analysis or examples of how these threats manifest in practice limits the depth of the insights provided. 3. **Limited Scope for Mitigation Discussion:** The mitigation strategies proposed may need more granularity; it is unclear how effective or feasible they would be in real-world scenarios. Considering these factors, the paper offers meaningful contributions to the field but could benefit from deeper, evidence-based exploration of its claims and proposed frameworks. The dual approach to risk management is commendable, yet the generalization remains evident. **Score: 7**   The score reflects a recognition of the paper's unique focus on a critical area of research within military applications of AI, alongside a reservation about the need for empirical support and depth in its analysis of mitigation strategies. The potential influence of the findings on military AI protocols justifies a relatively high score, while the lack of empirical validation introduces significant limitations.

- **Abstract**: This paper presents SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer aimed at enhancing the efficiency of text-to-image generation tasks. The authors build upon SANA-1.0 by presenting three primary innovations:  1. **Efficient Training Scaling**: The model employs a depth-growth paradigm, allowing it to scale from 1.6 billion to 4.8 billion parameters with lower computational resources, supported by an 8-bit memory-efficient optimizer.     2. **Model Depth Pruning**: It utilizes a block importance analysis for model compression, enabling reduction in model size while preserving quality.     3. **Inference-time Scaling**: The approach includes a repeated sampling strategy that allows smaller models to achieve comparable output quality to larger models during inference by adjusting computational demands.  These improvements lead to a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on the GenEval benchmark, which can be enhanced to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new state-of-the-art in this area. The techniques outlined allow the efficient scaling of models within various computational limits, ultimately making high-quality image generation more accessible. --- **Evaluation:** The paper SANA-1.5 presents several noteworthy advancements in the field of text-to-image generation, particularly in addressing the challenge of computational efficiency while achieving high-quality outputs.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Techniques**: The implementation of depth-growth paradigms and model depth pruning represents significant advancements that could enhance the deployment of large models in resource-limited environments. 2. **Real-World Application**: By focusing on scaling and efficiency, the findings have practical relevance, potentially widening access to high-quality AI tools for a broader range of applications. 3. **Benchmarking**: Achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on GenEval illustrates both the methodological innovation and the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, reinforcing the paper’s contributions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Incremental Nature**: While the techniques are novel, they build upon pre-existing concepts in model scaling and optimization. The progression from SANA-1.0 to SANA-1.5, although effective, may not represent a radical departure from current methodologies. 2. **Generalizability Concerns**: The focus on scaling and efficiency raises questions about the model’s performance in varied contexts beyond those explored in the GenEval benchmark. Potential limitations in other tasks or datasets may not be addressed. 3. **Evaluation on Broader Data**: The reliance on a single benchmark for demonstrating improvements could limit the perceived robustness of the model’s enhancements across diverse text-to-image generation scenarios. Overall, SANA-1.5 makes important contributions to improving the real-world applicability of large generative models through careful model design and innovative training strategies. It provides a solid step toward democratizing access to AI technologies. However, its reliance on existing methodologies and potential limitations in breadth yield some reservations about its transformative impact. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's balance between significant contributions to efficiency in model scaling and the somewhat incremental nature of the advancements presented, along with the importance of further exploration in broader contexts to solidify its impact.

- **Abstract**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold immense potential for advancing healthcare, offering rich, longitudinal data that combines structured information with valuable insights from unstructured clinical notes. However, the unstructured nature of clinical text poses significant challenges for secondary applications. Traditional methods for structuring EHR free-text data, such as rule-based systems and multi-stage pipelines, are often limited by their time-consuming configurations and inability to adapt across clinical notes from diverse healthcare settings. Few systems provide a comprehensive attribute extraction for terminologies. While giant large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA 405B excel at structuring tasks, they are slow, costly, and impractical for large-scale use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GENIE, a Generative Note Information Extraction system that leverages LLMs to streamline the structuring of unstructured clinical text into usable data with standardized format. GENIE processes entire paragraphs in a single pass, extracting entities, assertion statuses, locations, modifiers, values, and purposes with high accuracy. Its unified, end-to-end approach simplifies workflows, reduces errors, and eliminates the need for extensive manual intervention. Using a robust data preparation pipeline and fine-tuned small scale LLMs, GENIE achieves competitive performance across multiple information extraction tasks, outperforming traditional tools like cTAKES and MetaMap and can handle extra attributes to be extracted. GENIE strongly enhances real-world applicability and scalability in healthcare systems. By open-sourcing the model and test data, we aim to encourage collaboration and drive further advancements in EHR structurization.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces GENIE, a new Generative Note Information Extraction model designed to address the challenges of structuring unstructured clinical text in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Traditional methods for extracting information from clinical notes are often cumbersome and inflexible, while existing large language models (LLMs) are too slow and expensive for widespread utilization. GENIE leverages advancements in LLMs to efficiently process clinical paragraphs, extracting key data such as entities, assertion statuses, and modifiers in a single pass. It simplifies workflows, reduces errors, and minimizes manual effort, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing tools like cTAKES and MetaMap. The model is positioned as scalable and applicable to real-world healthcare systems, and its open-source nature aims to foster collaborative advancements in the field of EHR data structuring. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: GENIE's use of LLMs for a unified, end-to-end extraction process is a notable advancement in the effort to automate clinical data structuring. Most traditional tools depend on rule-based or pipeline models, which are less flexible and efficient.    2. **Performance**: The paper claims that GENIE outperform traditional extraction tools, which is significant considering the need for consistent, high-quality data handling in clinical settings. This could lead to improved data usability, benefiting secondary applications in healthcare research. 3. **Market Need**: There is a growing demand for tools that can seamlessly handle the integration of structured and unstructured data in EHRs, making the contextual relevance of GENIE particularly pronounced. 4. **Open-source Contribution**: The decision to open-source GENIE fosters community collaboration and encourages further improvements, which could benefit the field as a whole. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper does not sufficiently detail the evaluation metrics used to compare GENIE to its predecessors. A lack of transparent, replicable metrics can make it challenging to validate the claimed performance improvements. 2. **Scalability in Real-world Settings**: While GENIE is designed to enhance scalability, the paper should provide more concrete evidence or case studies demonstrating its performance in diverse clinical environments and workflows.  3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the potential limitations of GENIE, including biases in the underlying LLMs or challenges that might arise with extremely heterogeneous data across different healthcare systems. 4. **Dependency on Fine-tuned Models**: The reliance on fine-tuned small LLMs, while advantageous in some contexts, raises questions about how easily the model can be adapted for varied clinical applications or domains without incurring additional costs. ### Conclusion and Score Justification Overall, GENIE represents a meaningful contribution to the field of EHR data structuring by addressing specific limitations of existing tools and providing an innovative, efficient solution through the application of LLMs. Its strengths lie in its novel approach, potential for impactful outcomes in healthcare, and commitment to openness for collaborative improvement. However, the lack of rigorous evaluation metrics and real-world applicability examples, along with concerns regarding the model's flexibility and biases, temper its perceived impact. **Score: 7**  The score reflects a solid but not groundbreaking advancement, emphasizing both the promise of the GENIE model and the necessity for comprehensive validation and practical effectiveness across heterogeneous healthcare contexts.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on extensive multilingual corpora to acquire both language-specific cultural knowledge and general knowledge. Ideally, while LLMs should provide consistent responses to culture-independent questions across languages, we observe significant performance disparities. To address this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given question, we sample multiple responses across different languages, and select the most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining responses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing cross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval augmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages involved in CALM training leads to even higher accuracy and consistency. We offer a qualitative analysis of how cross-lingual consistency can enhance knowledge alignment and explore the method's generalizability. The source code and data of this paper are available on GitHub.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering" investigates the inconsistencies in performance that large language models (LLMs) exhibit across different languages when answering culture-independent questions. The authors introduce a novel framework called CALM, which leverages the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of language models. Under this framework, for a given question, the model samples multiple responses from various languages and selects the most consistent one as the target, while treating others as negative examples. This process is facilitated by direct preference optimization (DPO) to align knowledge across languages effectively. The paper reports evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets that demonstrate CALM's efficacy in improving cross-lingual question answering accuracy in both zero-shot and retrieval-augmented scenarios. Additionally, increasing the number of languages during CALM training appears to further enhance accuracy and consistency. The authors also provide a qualitative analysis showing how cross-lingual consistency contributes to better knowledge alignment and discuss the generalizability of their method. The paper concludes with the availability of its source code and datasets on GitHub. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The concept of aligning knowledge across languages in LLMs through self-consistency checks is relatively innovative. While previous works have explored multilingual model training and knowledge transfer, the CALM framework employs a unique approach by initially sampling responses and leveraging DPO for optimizing language alignment. This aspect marks a noteworthy contribution to the field, as it specifically addresses cross-lingual performance disparities, which remain a significant challenge in multilingual NLP. **Significance**:  The significance of this work is underscored by the ongoing interest in improving LLMs' cross-lingual capabilities, given the increasing prevalence of these models in applications that require cultural sensitivity and linguistic versatility. The effectiveness demonstrated on two benchmark datasets (MEDQA and X-CSQA) suggests practical applicability and relevance within the realm of multilingual question answering. **Strengths**:  - The paper’s experimental results are robust, illustrating effective performance improvements across various languages and conditions. - The qualitative analysis provides additional insights into the mechanisms by which cross-lingual consistency influences knowledge alignment, enhancing the understandability of the results. - The availability of the code and datasets further supports reproducibility and community advancement. **Weaknesses**:  - While the paper presents solid results, it could benefit from a broader evaluation across more languages and a more extensive range of question types to ascertain the method's generalizability and robustness. - The reliance on self-consistency alone might overlook cases where nuanced cultural differences lead to varying interpretations of questions, which could limit the applicability of CALM in some contexts. - More discussion on limitations and potential biases introduced by the training data across different languages would strengthen the paper's scholarly rigor. ### Conclusion Considering the paper’s contributions to the field, its innovative approach to a pressing issue in multilingual NLP, and the solid empirical validation of claims, it scores relatively highly. However, the need for broader applicability and deeper exploratory analysis limits its impact slightly. **Score: 8**
