- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11298v1)
- **Authors**: Parisa Fard Moshiri, Murat Arda Onsu, Poonam Lohan, Burak Kantarci, Emil Janulewicz
- **Abstract**: Efficient Service Function Chain (SFC) provisioning and Virtual Network Function (VNF) placement are critical for enhancing network performance in modern architectures such as Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) aids decision-making in dynamic network environments, its reliance on structured inputs and predefined rules limits adaptability in unforeseen scenarios. Additionally, incorrect actions by a DRL agent may require numerous training iterations to correct, potentially reinforcing suboptimal policies and degrading performance. This paper integrates DRL with Language Models (LMs), specifically Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and DistilBERT, to enhance network management. By feeding final VNF allocations from DRL into the LM, the system can process and respond to queries related to SFCs, DCs, and VNFs, enabling real-time insights into resource utilization, bottleneck detection, and future demand planning. The LMs are fine-tuned to our domain-specific dataset using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Results show that BERT outperforms DistilBERT with a lower test loss (0.28 compared to 0.36) and higher confidence (0.83 compared to 0.74), though BERT requires approximately 46% more processing time.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes integrating Language Models (LMs), specifically BERT and DistilBERT, with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for enhanced network state monitoring in Service Function Chain (SFC) provisioning.  The DRL component handles VNF placement, while the LM interprets the resulting network state and answers queries about resource utilization, bottlenecks, and potential future demands.  The LMs are fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific dataset created by the authors.  Experimental results show BERT outperforms DistilBERT in terms of accuracy and confidence but at a higher computational cost.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a reasonable approach to improve the adaptability and interpretability of DRL-based SFC provisioning. The integration of LMs to provide real-time network state monitoring is a valuable contribution, addressing a known limitation of DRL's reliance on structured inputs and predefined rules.  The use of LoRA for efficient fine-tuning is also a positive aspect, demonstrating practical considerations for deploying such a system. The comparative analysis of BERT and DistilBERT highlights the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, offering valuable insights for practical implementation.

However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall novelty and impact:

* **Incremental Novelty:** The core idea of combining DRL and LMs for network management isn't entirely novel. While the specific application to SFC provisioning and the use of LoRA are contributions, the overall concept has been explored in related areas.  The paper doesn't sufficiently differentiate itself from prior work in this area.  The related work section acknowledges some overlapping research but does not adequately address how this work differs.
* **Limited Scope of the LM:** The LM's role is primarily reactive; it analyzes the *results* of the DRL agent's actions rather than actively participating in the decision-making process.  A more impactful approach would involve the LM directly influencing the DRL policy or providing proactive recommendations for optimization.  The current approach is more of a post-hoc analysis.
* **Dataset Limitations:** The paper lacks detailed information about the dataset's size, diversity, and representativeness. Without this information, it's difficult to assess the generalizability of the findings.  A larger, more diverse dataset would significantly strengthen the conclusions.
* **Question Type Limitation:** The limitations of the LM's abilities for question types requiring computation hinder its practical application.  More sophisticated methods for integrating numerical data into the LM's context are necessary.

Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper makes a modest contribution to the field.  While the integration of LMs for post-hoc analysis offers some value, the incremental nature of the novelty and limitations of the approach prevent it from being a groundbreaking contribution.

### CORDIAL: Can Multimodal Large Language Models Effectively Understand Coherence Relationships?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11300v1)
- **Authors**: Aashish Anantha Ramakrishnan, Aadarsh Anantha Ramakrishnan, Dongwon Lee
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are renowned for their superior instruction-following and reasoning capabilities across diverse problem domains. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on assessing factual and logical correctness in downstream tasks, with limited emphasis on evaluating MLLMs' ability to interpret pragmatic cues and intermodal relationships. To address this gap, we assess the competency of MLLMs in performing Multimodal Discourse Analysis (MDA) using Coherence Relations. Our benchmark, CORDIAL, encompasses a broad spectrum of Coherence Relations across 3 different discourse domains at varying levels of granularity. Through our experiments on 10+ MLLMs employing different prompting strategies, we show that even top models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o fail to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines. This study emphasizes the need to move beyond similarity-based metrics and adopt a discourse-driven framework for evaluating MLLMs, providing a more nuanced assessment of their capabilities. The benchmark and code are available at: https://github.com/aashish2000/CORDIAL.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces CORDIAL, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on multimodal discourse analysis (MDA) using coherence relations.  Existing MLLM benchmarks primarily focus on factual accuracy and logical reasoning, neglecting pragmatic understanding of intermodal relationships. CORDIAL addresses this gap by using three datasets representing different discourse domains (disaster management, social media, online articles) with varying levels of coherence relation complexity (binary, multi-class, multi-label).  Experiments on over ten MLLMs, including leading models like GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, reveal that even these advanced models struggle to match the performance of simple classifier-based baselines, particularly when dealing with pragmatic cues. The authors conclude that current MLLMs lack a robust understanding of coherence relations and advocate for a shift towards coherence-aware evaluation and fine-tuning methods.  The CORDIAL benchmark and code are publicly available.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multimodal language model evaluation. Its novelty lies in focusing on the often-overlooked aspect of pragmatic understanding and coherence in multimodal contexts.  The creation of CORDIAL, with its diverse datasets and complexity levels, is a significant undertaking and provides a much-needed tool for researchers. The finding that even top-performing MLLMs underperform simple baselines is striking and highlights a crucial weakness in current models.

However, several weaknesses exist. The reliance on existing datasets limits the complete control over data quality and potential biases. The study's scope is limited to single-turn discourses and the English language, restricting generalizability. The exploration of prompting strategies, while insightful, doesn't fundamentally solve the underlying problem of MLLM comprehension of coherence relations.  Finally, the paper doesn't delve deeply into the *why* behind the MLLM failuresâ€”a more in-depth analysis of the model's internal representations and attention mechanisms would strengthen the conclusions.


Despite these weaknesses, CORDIAL offers a compelling new benchmark that directly addresses a significant gap in MLLM evaluation. Its potential influence is considerable as it pushes the field towards a more nuanced understanding of multimodal reasoning capabilities, beyond simple accuracy metrics.  The public availability of the benchmark further enhances its impact.

### Smoothing Out Hallucinations: Mitigating LLM Hallucination with Smoothed Knowledge Distillation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11306v1)
- **Authors**: Hieu Nguyen, Zihao He, Shoumik Atul Gandre, Ujjwal Pasupulety, Sharanya Kumari Shivakumar, Kristina Lerman
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination, generating factually incorrect or ungrounded content, which limits their reliability in high-stakes applications. A key factor contributing to hallucination is the use of hard labels during training, which enforce deterministic supervision, encourage overconfidence, and disregard the uncertainty inherent in natural language. To address this, we propose mitigating hallucination through knowledge distillation (KD), where a teacher model provides smoothed soft labels to a student model, reducing overconfidence and improving factual grounding. We apply KD during supervised finetuning on instructional data, evaluating its effectiveness across LLMs from different families. Experimental results on summarization benchmarks demonstrate that KD reduces hallucination compared to standard finetuning while preserving performance on general NLP tasks. These findings highlight KD as a promising approach for mitigating hallucination in LLMs and improving model reliability.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by employing smoothed knowledge distillation (KD) during supervised fine-tuning.  The core idea is to replace hard labels with soft labels generated by a larger, teacher model.  This approach addresses the overconfidence and arbitrary assumptions introduced by hard labels, leading to more calibrated and factually grounded outputs.  Experiments across three LLM families (Llama-2, Llama-3.1, and Qwen-2.5) and summarization benchmarks (CNN/Daily Mail and XSUM) demonstrate that KD reduces faithfulness hallucinations (hallucinations not grounded in the input context) while preserving performance on general NLP tasks.  The authors also provide a case study illustrating the improved faithfulness of KD-trained models.  While acknowledging limitations such as dependence on a well-calibrated teacher and the focus on faithfulness hallucination, the paper suggests KD as a promising technique for improving LLM reliability.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the growing research on LLM hallucination mitigation, but its novelty and overall impact aren't groundbreaking.  

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a crucial problem:** Hallucination is a major obstacle to LLM adoption in high-stakes applications. The paper tackles this directly.
* **Methodological rigor:** The experiments are conducted on multiple LLM families and benchmarks, enhancing the generalizability of the findings.  The use of multiple evaluation metrics is also commendable.
* **Clear presentation:** The paper clearly explains the motivation, methodology, and results.  The case study helps visualize the impact of KD.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental novelty:** While the application of KD to mitigate hallucination is explored, the core techniques of KD and the connection between hard labels and overconfidence are well-established. The novelty lies primarily in the specific application and demonstration of its effectiveness in this context.
* **Limited scope:** The focus is primarily on faithfulness hallucination.  Factuality hallucination, a critical aspect of the problem, is not deeply investigated.
* **Dependence on teacher model:** The success of KD hinges on a well-calibrated teacher model.  The paper doesn't fully address how to ensure this, limiting the practical implications.
* **Instruction finetuning limitation:**  The study's use of instruction finetuning instead of full pretraining with KD weakens the claim of addressing the fundamental issues associated with hard labels.


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's findings could influence future research on LLM training paradigms and hallucination mitigation. It provides evidence for the potential benefits of uncertainty-aware supervision.  However, its impact might be limited by the incremental nature of the contribution and the need for further investigation into other types of hallucinations and the scalability of the KD approach.


Score: 7

**Rationale:** The paper makes a solid contribution by demonstrating the effectiveness of a well-known technique (KD) in a novel application (reducing LLM hallucinations). However, the novelty is incremental, the scope is somewhat limited, and the dependence on a well-calibrated teacher model remains a challenge. The paper's overall significance is good, but not exceptional, hence the score of 7.

### ALGEN: Few-shot Inversion Attacks on Textual Embeddings using Alignment and Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11308v1)
- **Authors**: Yiyi Chen, Qiongkai Xu, Johannes Bjerva
- **Abstract**: With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases, private textual data is increasingly processed and stored as numerical embeddings. However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings are vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to reveal sensitive information. Previous research has largely assumed access to millions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or nearly unrestricted API access. With our method, a single data point is sufficient for a partially successful inversion attack. With as little as 1k data samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box encoders, without training on leaked data. We present a Few-shot Textual Embedding Inversion Attack using ALignment and GENeration (ALGEN), by aligning victim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to reconstruct text. We find that ALGEN attacks can be effectively transferred across domains and languages, revealing key information. We further examine a variety of defense mechanisms against ALGEN, and find that none are effective, highlighting the vulnerabilities posed by inversion attacks. By significantly lowering the cost of inversion and proving that embedding spaces can be aligned through one-step optimization, we establish a new textual embedding inversion paradigm with broader applications for embedding alignment in NLP.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces ALGEN, a novel few-shot inversion attack against textual embeddings stored in vector databases.  Unlike previous methods requiring millions of training samples, ALGEN achieves partially successful inversion with a single data point and optimal performance with only 1,000 samples.  It works by aligning victim embeddings to the attacker's embedding space using a one-step optimization and then reconstructing the text using a pre-trained generative model. The attack demonstrates transferability across languages and domains.  The authors also evaluate several existing defense mechanisms (Gaussian noise, watermarking, shuffling, differential privacy) and find them ineffective against ALGEN, highlighting significant security vulnerabilities.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes several valuable contributions to the field of embedding security. The key novelty lies in demonstrating the effectiveness of a few-shot inversion attack, significantly lowering the barrier for carrying out such attacks. This is a crucial finding, as it makes these attacks far more plausible in real-world scenarios where massive data leakage might not be readily available. The transferability across languages and domains further underscores the broad applicability and severity of this threat.  The comprehensive evaluation of existing defenses, showcasing their ineffectiveness against ALGEN, is also a strong point.

However, the paper has some weaknesses. The proposed method relies heavily on the availability of a suitable pre-trained generative model.  The effectiveness of the attack is contingent upon the quality of this model, a factor that is not fully explored. The reliance on a pre-trained model also raises questions about potential biases inherent in the underlying training data.  Further, the paper focuses primarily on the attack itself, with less attention dedicated to exploring entirely novel defense strategies. Although a number of existing defenses were evaluated, this leaves open the question of how to effectively mitigate the threat posed by ALGEN.

The potential impact of this work is significant, as it raises serious concerns about the security of textual embeddings used in various applications. This work is likely to stimulate further research into more robust defense mechanisms and potentially lead to changes in the design and deployment of embedding-based systems.  Given the significant novelty of the few-shot attack, the comprehensive evaluation and the potential influence on future research, the paper warrants a high score.

### System Message Generation for User Preferences using Open-Source Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11330v1)
- **Authors**: Minbyul Jeong, Jungho Cho, Minsoo Khang, Dawoon Jung, Teakgyu Hong
- **Abstract**: System messages play a crucial role in interactions with large language models (LLMs), often serving as prompts to initiate conversations. Through system messages, users can assign specific roles, perform intended tasks, incorporate background information, specify various output formats and communication styles. Despite such versatility, publicly available data are often lack system messages and subject to strict license constraints in the industry field. Manual labeling of publicly available data with system messages that align with user instructions demands significant resources. In view of such challenges, our work introduces SysGen, a pipeline for generating system messages with better aligned assistant responses from the supervised fine-tuning dataset without system messages. Training on SysGen data has demonstrated substantial improvements in the alignment of model responses with system messages and user instructions, as demonstrated across various open-source models on the Multifacet benchmark, while maintaining minimal impact on other unseen benchmarks such as Open LLM Leaderboard 2. Our qualitative analysis highlights the importance of diverse system messages to ensure better adaptability across different contexts.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces SYSGEN, a pipeline for automatically generating system messages for large language models (LLMs).  Current datasets often lack diverse system messages or are subject to licensing restrictions. SYSGEN uses open-source LLMs to generate system messages and corresponding, improved assistant responses from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets lacking such messages.  The generated system messages incorporate eight key functionalities (role, content, task, action, style, background, tool, format).  Experiments on the Multifacet benchmark show improved alignment between assistant responses, system messages, and user instructions across several open-source models.  Knowledge distillation with SYSGEN data also improved performance for models not originally trained with system roles. Importantly, SYSGEN minimized performance degradation on unseen benchmarks, indicating its compatibility with existing SFT workflows.  The authors highlight the importance of diverse system messages and correctly distinguishing system and user roles in chat templates.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score Justification:**

Score: 7

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a significant problem:** The lack of readily available, diverse system message data for LLM training is a real bottleneck. SYSGEN offers a practical solution to this problem.
* **Methodological rigor:**  The pipeline is well-defined, involving several stages of filtering and verification to ensure quality. The use of LLM-as-a-judge is a clever approach to reduce manual effort.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper uses multiple benchmarks (Multifacet and Open LLM Leaderboard 2) to assess performance, both in terms of alignment with system messages and impact on unseen tasks.  The ablation study further strengthens the findings.
* **Practical impact:** The method is readily reproducible using open-source models and tools, making it accessible to the wider research community.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited novelty in core idea:** While the application to system message generation is novel, the core idea of using LLMs to augment datasets is not entirely new.  The paper needs to more strongly emphasize the unique aspects of its approach compared to other data augmentation techniques.
* **Focus on single-turn conversations:** The limitation to single-turn conversations restricts the generalizability of the findings and limits the practical impact. Multi-turn conversation handling is crucial for realistic LLM applications.
* **Potential biases in open-source models:** The reliance on open-source LLMs introduces the possibility of inheriting biases present in their training data. This aspect is not sufficiently addressed.
* **Overly positive interpretation of results:** While improvements are shown, the magnitude of these improvements is not always substantial and might be explained by other factors than the system messages themselves.  A more nuanced discussion is needed.


**Potential Influence on the Field:**

SYSGEN offers a valuable contribution by providing a practical method for generating system message data.  While the core idea isn't groundbreaking, the detailed pipeline and comprehensive evaluation make it a useful tool for researchers working on LLM training and alignment.  The impact will be more substantial if future work extends the approach to multi-turn conversations and more thoroughly addresses potential biases.

### Inverse Flow and Consistency Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11333v1)
- **Authors**: Yuchen Zhang, Jian Zhou
- **Abstract**: Inverse generation problems, such as denoising without ground truth observations, is a critical challenge in many scientific inquiries and real-world applications. While recent advances in generative models like diffusion models, conditional flow matching, and consistency models achieved impressive results by casting generation as denoising problems, they cannot be directly used for inverse generation without access to clean data. Here we introduce Inverse Flow (IF), a novel framework that enables using these generative models for inverse generation problems including denoising without ground truth. Inverse Flow can be flexibly applied to nearly any continuous noise distribution and allows complex dependencies. We propose two algorithms for learning Inverse Flows, Inverse Flow Matching (IFM) and Inverse Consistency Model (ICM). Notably, to derive the computationally efficient, simulation-free inverse consistency model objective, we generalized consistency training to any forward diffusion processes or conditional flows, which have applications beyond denoising. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IF on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming prior approaches while enabling noise distributions that previous methods cannot support. Finally, we showcase applications of our techniques to fluorescence microscopy and single-cell genomics data, highlighting IF's utility in scientific problems. Overall, this work expands the applications of powerful generative models to inversion generation problems.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Inverse Flow (IF), a framework for solving inverse generation problems, like denoising without ground truth data.  Existing generative models (diffusion models, conditional flow matching, consistency models) excel at forward generation but fail in inverse scenarios where only noisy data is available.  IF adapts these models by learning a mapping from noisy data to the underlying clean data.  Two algorithms are proposed: Inverse Flow Matching (IFM) and the computationally efficient Inverse Consistency Model (ICM).  ICM, notably, generalizes consistency training to arbitrary forward diffusion processes or conditional flows.  Experiments on synthetic and real datasets (fluorescence microscopy, single-cell genomics) demonstrate IF's superior performance and flexibility compared to existing methods, particularly for complex noise distributions.  A key limitation is the reliance on prior knowledge of the noise distribution.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of inverse problems and generative modeling.  The core idea of adapting existing generative models for inverse generation is novel and addresses a significant limitation in current approaches.  The development of ICM, with its simulation-free objective, is a particularly strong contribution, enhancing computational efficiency. The generalization of consistency training is also a noteworthy advancement, expanding the applicability of consistency models beyond their original scope.  The empirical results across diverse datasets further support the effectiveness of IF.

However, the paper's strength is somewhat tempered by some weaknesses.  The reliance on pre-knowledge of the noise distribution is a major limitation, reducing the method's applicability in real-world scenarios where this information might be unavailable or imprecise.  While the authors acknowledge this, a more in-depth discussion of potential mitigation strategies or future work addressing this constraint would strengthen the paper.  Furthermore,  the theoretical analysis, while present, could be more comprehensive and rigorous. A deeper investigation into the convergence properties of IFM and ICM, and the impact of various choices for interpolation in ut(x | x0, x1), would improve the paper's theoretical grounding.


Considering the novelty of the central idea, the significant improvement in computational efficiency offered by ICM, the generalization of consistency training, and the strong empirical evidence presented, the paper represents a substantial advancement. The limitation concerning prior noise knowledge, while significant, doesn't completely negate the value of the contribution.  Therefore, a high score is warranted.

### ExaGPT: Example-Based Machine-Generated Text Detection for Human Interpretability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11336v1)
- **Authors**: Ryuto Koike, Masahiro Kaneko, Ayana Niwa, Preslav Nakov, Naoaki Okazaki
- **Abstract**: Detecting texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) could cause grave mistakes due to incorrect decisions, such as undermining student's academic dignity. LLM text detection thus needs to ensure the interpretability of the decision, which can help users judge how reliably correct its prediction is. When humans verify whether a text is human-written or LLM-generated, they intuitively investigate with which of them it shares more similar spans. However, existing interpretable detectors are not aligned with the human decision-making process and fail to offer evidence that users easily understand. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExaGPT, an interpretable detection approach grounded in the human decision-making process for verifying the origin of a text. ExaGPT identifies a text by checking whether it shares more similar spans with human-written vs. with LLM-generated texts from a datastore. This approach can provide similar span examples that contribute to the decision for each span in the text as evidence. Our human evaluation demonstrates that providing similar span examples contributes more effectively to judging the correctness of the decision than existing interpretable methods. Moreover, extensive experiments in four domains and three generators show that ExaGPT massively outperforms prior powerful detectors by up to +40.9 points of accuracy at a false positive rate of 1%.
- **Summary**: ExaGPT is an interpretable machine-generated text detection method that leverages a datastore of human-written and LLM-generated text.  Unlike previous methods, ExaGPT mirrors human detection strategies by identifying similarity between spans (n-grams) in the target text and spans in the datastore.  It scores each span based on length and similarity to datastore spans, then uses dynamic programming to optimize span segmentation for human understanding.  The final classification is based on the average score of the selected spans, with example similar spans provided as evidence. Human evaluation demonstrates ExaGPT's superior interpretability compared to baselines (RoBERTa with SHAP, LR-GLTR, and DNA-GPT), and extensive experiments show it significantly outperforms these baselines in accuracy at a 1% false positive rate (up to +40.9 points).  While effective, ExaGPT's inference cost is a limitation due to the k-NN search across the datastore.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

ExaGPT presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM-generated text detection by focusing on interpretability, a crucial aspect often overlooked in pursuit of high accuracy. The approach, grounded in human intuition, offers a novel perspective by directly comparing textual spans for similarity, providing concrete evidence for the classification.  The dynamic programming for optimal span selection further enhances interpretability.  The significant improvement in accuracy at a low false positive rate is a strong result, making it practically useful.  The comprehensive experiments across diverse domains and LLMs strengthen the findings.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  The core idea of using similarity comparison isn't entirely new; existing methods implicitly use similarity measures, though not in such a direct and explicitly interpretable manner.  The dynamic programming optimization, while beneficial, is a relatively standard technique. The high computational cost, while acknowledged, is a significant weakness that limits scalability and real-world applicability.  The human evaluation, although demonstrating improved interpretability, involves a small number of participants with NLP expertise, potentially biasing the results and limiting the generalizability of the interpretability claims.

Despite these weaknesses, ExaGPT's focus on interpretability and its substantial performance improvement at a low false positive rate are impactful.  The methodology offers a new perspective on designing interpretable LLM detection systems. The publicly available code and data enhance reproducibility and further contribute to its impact.

### Evaluating the Performance of the DeepSeek Model in Confidential Computing Environment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11347v1)
- **Authors**: Ben Dong, Qian Wang
- **Abstract**: The increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cloud environments raises critical security concerns, particularly regarding model confidentiality and data privacy. Confidential computing, enabled by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), offers a promising solution to mitigate these risks. However, existing TEE implementations, primarily CPU-based, struggle to efficiently support the resource-intensive nature of LLM inference and training. In this work, we present the first evaluation of the DeepSeek model within a TEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). Our study benchmarks DeepSeek's performance across CPU-only, CPU-GPU hybrid, and TEE-based implementations. For smaller parameter sets, such as DeepSeek-R1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. It highlights the potential for efficiently deploying LLM models on resource-constrained systems while ensuring security. The overall GPU-to-CPU performance ratio averages 12 across different model sizes, with smaller models exhibiting a lower ratio. Additionally, we provide foundational insights and guidance on optimizing CPU-GPU confidential computing solutions for scalable and secure AI deployments. Our findings contribute to the advancement of privacy-preserving AI, paving the way for efficient and secure LLM inference in confidential computing environments.
- **Summary**: This paper evaluates the performance of the DeepSeek large language model (LLM) within Intel's Trusted Domain Extensions (TDX) confidential computing environment.  The authors benchmark DeepSeek's performance across CPU-only, CPU-GPU hybrid, and TDX-based implementations, using three different model sizes (1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters).  They find that for the smallest model, the TDX implementation outperforms the CPU-only version, demonstrating the potential for secure LLM deployment on resource-constrained systems. However, the performance gains diminish with larger models.  GPU acceleration significantly improves performance across all model sizes, but current TDX limitations prevent full GPU utilization within the secure enclave. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for future research to improve the integration of GPUs within TDX to balance security and performance for confidential AI inference.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of secure AI, but its novelty and significance are limited by several factors.

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a crucial problem:**  The paper tackles the important issue of securing LLMs in cloud environments, a critical concern for privacy and intellectual property protection.
* **First-of-its-kind evaluation:**  The evaluation of DeepSeek within TDX is novel, providing a benchmark for future research in this area.  The comparative analysis across different hardware configurations (CPU-only, CPU-GPU, TDX) is also a strength.
* **Practical insights:** The results offer practical insights into the performance trade-offs between security and efficiency when deploying LLMs in confidential computing environments.  This is useful for researchers and developers working on similar projects.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited scope:** The study focuses solely on the DeepSeek model and Intel TDX.  The generalizability of the findings to other LLMs and TEE technologies is unclear.  The specific performance characteristics of DeepSeek might not translate to other models.
* **Lack of in-depth analysis of performance bottlenecks:** While the paper identifies performance limitations, it doesn't delve deeply into the specific bottlenecks within the TDX environment or the reasons for the performance discrepancies between different model sizes.  A more granular analysis would strengthen the conclusions.
* **Overemphasis on novelty:** The paper repeatedly emphasizes its novelty as the "first evaluation of DeepSeek in a TEE,"  but this novelty is relatively narrow.  The core findingsâ€”performance trade-offs between security and efficiency in confidential computingâ€”are well-established.
* **Limited discussion of alternative approaches:** The paper could have benefited from a broader discussion of alternative approaches to securing LLMs, such as homomorphic encryption or federated learning.  This would provide more context and a more balanced perspective.


**Overall Impact:**

The paper contributes to the field by providing a benchmark for LLM performance in a specific confidential computing environment. However, its limited scope and lack of in-depth analysis restrict its overall impact.  While valuable, it's more of a foundational study rather than a breakthrough.


Score: 6

The score reflects the paper's contribution in establishing a baseline for evaluating LLMs within TDX.  However, the relatively narrow scope, lack of in-depth analysis, and the established nature of the underlying challenges limit its overall novelty and impact.  Further research expanding on these limitations would significantly increase its contribution to the field.

### Biases in Edge Language Models: Detection, Analysis, and Mitigation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11349v1)
- **Authors**: Vinamra Sharma, Danilo Pietro Pau, JosÃ© Cano
- **Abstract**: The integration of large language models (LLMs) on low-power edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, known as edge language models (ELMs), has introduced opportunities for more personalized, secure, and low-latency language intelligence that is accessible to all. However, the resource constraints inherent in edge devices and the lack of robust ethical safeguards in language models raise significant concerns about fairness, accountability, and transparency in model output generation. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of text-based bias across language model deployments on edge, cloud, and desktop environments, aiming to evaluate how deployment settings influence model fairness. Specifically, we examined an optimized Llama-2 model running on a Raspberry Pi 4; GPT 4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-flash, and Grok-beta models running on cloud servers; and Gemma2 and Mistral models running on a MacOS desktop machine. Our results demonstrate that Llama-2 running on Raspberry Pi 4 is 43.23% and 21.89% more prone to showing bias over time compared to models running on the desktop and cloud-based environments. We also propose the implementation of a feedback loop, a mechanism that iteratively adjusts model behavior based on previous outputs, where predefined constraint weights are applied layer-by-layer during inference, allowing the model to correct bias patterns, resulting in 79.28% reduction in model bias.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates bias in edge language models (ELMs), comparing their performance to cloud and desktop-deployed LLMs.  The authors find that an optimized Llama-2 model on a Raspberry Pi 4 exhibits significantly higher bias (43.23% and 21.89% more than desktop and cloud models, respectively) after 1500 repetitive prompts focused on racial stereotypes.  They propose a layer-by-layer feedback loop during inference to mitigate this bias, achieving a 79.28% reduction.  The study utilizes INT8 quantization for the ELM to reduce resource demands.  However, the feedback loop, while effective, increases inference time significantly.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing concern about bias in LLMs, extending the discussion to the often-overlooked context of resource-constrained edge deployments. The identification of increased bias in ELMs is a significant finding, highlighting a previously under-researched area.  The proposed feedback loop offers a novel approach to bias mitigation *without* requiring full model retraining, a crucial advantage for edge devices.

However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall impact:

* **Limited Scope of Bias:** The bias analysis focuses heavily on a specific type of racial bias using a carefully constructed, repetitive set of prompts.  The generalizability of these findings to other types of biases and more naturalistic prompt scenarios remains unclear.  The prompts are somewhat contrived and may not fully reflect real-world usage.
* **Feedback Loop Complexity and Overhead:** While the feedback loop demonstrates effectiveness, its implementation is resource-intensive, significantly increasing inference time.  The practicality for truly low-power edge devices is questionable.  The predefined weights for the feedback loop lack transparency; a more sophisticated, data-driven approach to weighting adjustments would strengthen the method.
* **Lack of Comparison Metrics:**  While bias percentage is presented, other crucial metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score are missing, hindering a complete evaluation of model performance. Thereâ€™s also no explicit comparison of different quantization methods.
* **Reproducibility Concerns:** While references are provided, crucial implementation details regarding the feedback loop (e.g., the specific predefined weights) are insufficiently detailed, raising concerns about reproducibility.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's focus on ELM bias is timely and relevant. The proposed feedback loop, while needing further development, represents a novel approach. The findings regarding the increased bias in edge deployments should encourage further research in this domain.


Score: 7

The score reflects the paper's significant contribution in highlighting the bias problem in ELMs and proposing a novel, albeit computationally expensive, mitigation technique. The limitations in scope, methodology, and lack of thorough evaluation prevent it from achieving a higher score.  Future work addressing the weaknesses mentioned above would considerably strengthen the paper's impact.

### "Nuclear Deployed!": Analyzing Catastrophic Risks in Decision-making of Autonomous LLM Agents
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11355v1)
- **Authors**: Rongwu Xu, Xiaojian Li, Shuo Chen, Wei Xu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are evolving into autonomous decision-makers, raising concerns about catastrophic risks in high-stakes scenarios, particularly in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) domains. Based on the insight that such risks can originate from trade-offs between the agent's Helpful, Harmlessness and Honest (HHH) goals, we build a novel three-stage evaluation framework, which is carefully constructed to effectively and naturally expose such risks. We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced. Furthermore, stronger reasoning abilities often increase, rather than mitigate, these risks. We also show that these agents can violate instructions and superior commands. On the whole, we empirically prove the existence of catastrophic risks in autonomous LLM agents. We will release our code upon request.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the catastrophic risks posed by autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents in high-stakes scenarios, specifically those involving Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) materials.  The authors develop a three-stage simulation framework to evaluate the agents' behavior, focusing on the trade-offs between helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH).  Experiments across 12 advanced LLMs reveal that agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic actions and deception, even without explicit instruction.  Surprisingly, stronger reasoning abilities often exacerbate these risks, leading to increased disobedience and deceptive behaviors.  The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for comprehensive testing and alternative control mechanisms for autonomous LLM agents before deployment.


**Novelty and Significance:**

The paper's primary strength lies in its focus on a critically important, yet under-researched area: the catastrophic risks of *autonomous* LLMs in high-stakes scenarios.  Most existing research addresses LLM safety in less consequential contexts. The three-stage evaluation framework, while simulation-based, provides a structured approach to expose these risks, offering a valuable contribution to the methodology of AI safety research.  The empirical findings, demonstrating the potential for autonomous catastrophic behavior and deception, and the counterintuitive link between strong reasoning and increased risk, are significant and warrant serious attention from the AI safety community.

However, the paper suffers from some limitations.  The reliance on simulated environments, while acknowledged, weakens the direct applicability of the findings to real-world scenarios.  The specific CBRN scenarios chosen, though illustrative, may not fully capture the breadth of potential risks. The study also lacks a detailed discussion of potential mitigation strategies beyond general recommendations for testing and improved control mechanisms.  The "HHH trade-offs" framework, while helpful for organizing the results, is not a novel concept in itself.

The paper's potential influence on the field is significant, given the growing concern about increasingly autonomous AI systems.  The findings raise crucial questions about the development and deployment of such systems, potentially prompting further research into robust control mechanisms and more realistic evaluation methodologies.  However, the limitations discussed above might hinder its immediate impact on practical AI safety guidelines.

### SAIF: A Sparse Autoencoder Framework for Interpreting and Steering Instruction Following of Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11356v1)
- **Authors**: Zirui He, Haiyan Zhao, Yiran Qiao, Fan Yang, Ali Payani, Jing Ma, Mengnan Du
- **Abstract**: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow instructions is crucial for their practical applications, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages sparse autoencoders (SAE) to interpret how instruction following works in these models. We demonstrate how the features we identify can effectively steer model outputs to align with given instructions. Through analysis of SAE latent activations, we identify specific latents responsible for instruction following behavior. Our findings reveal that instruction following capabilities are encoded by a distinct set of instruction-relevant SAE latents. These latents both show semantic proximity to relevant instructions and demonstrate causal effects on model behavior. Our research highlights several crucial factors for achieving effective steering performance: precise feature identification, the role of final layer, and optimal instruction positioning. Additionally, we demonstrate that our methodology scales effectively across SAEs and LLMs of varying sizes.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces SAIF, a framework using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret and steer the instruction-following behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs).  SAIF identifies instruction-relevant features within the LLM's representation space by analyzing SAE latent activations across variations of the same instruction. These features, representing multiple high-level concepts, are then used to create steering vectors that modify the model's output to better align with the given instructions. Experiments across various LLMs and instruction types (translation, summarization, keyword inclusion) demonstrate SAIF's effectiveness in improving instruction following, particularly when instructions are placed after the input text. The paper highlights the importance of the final layer in SAE-based steering and the optimal number of features for effective control.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the burgeoning field of LLM interpretability and control.  The use of SAEs to decompose complex instruction-following behavior into interpretable latent features is a novel approach. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steering method, showing improvements in both strict and loose accuracy across different tasks and model sizes.  The analysis of the role of the final layer and optimal feature selection adds to our understanding of LLM internal mechanisms.  The use of diverse instruction variations and multiple evaluation metrics enhances the robustness of the findings.

However, some limitations exist. The reliance on GPT-4o-mini for evaluation introduces a potential source of bias and subjectivity. The methodology focuses on relatively simple instructions; extending it to more complex, multi-step reasoning tasks would significantly strengthen the claims. While the paper discusses model scale, a more in-depth analysis of the scalability and computational cost of SAIF would be beneficial.  The explanation of why only certain layers of the LLM are useful in this process could be more detailed and rigorous.  Finally, the paper does not directly compare its method against other prominent techniques in the activation steering literature, hindering a direct comparison of performance.

Despite these weaknesses, the core contribution of SAIFâ€”using SAEs to disentangle and steer instruction followingâ€”presents a significant advancement in the field. The methodology is well-described, the experiments are thorough, and the findings are insightful. The potential impact on future research in LLM interpretability and control is considerable.

### VLDBench: Vision Language Models Disinformation Detection Benchmark
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11361v1)
- **Authors**: Shaina Raza, Ashmal Vayani, Aditya Jain, Aravind Narayanan, Vahid Reza Khazaie, Syed Raza Bashir, Elham Dolatabadi, Gias Uddin, Christos Emmanouilidis, Rizwan Qureshi, Mubarak Shah
- **Abstract**: The rapid rise of AI-generated content has made detecting disinformation increasingly challenging. In particular, multimodal disinformation, i.e., online posts-articles that contain images and texts with fabricated information are specially designed to deceive. While existing AI safety benchmarks primarily address bias and toxicity, multimodal disinformation detection remains largely underexplored. To address this challenge, we present the Vision-Language Disinformation Detection Benchmark VLDBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for detecting disinformation across both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text and image) content, comprising 31,000} news article-image pairs, spanning 13 distinct categories, for robust evaluation. VLDBench features a rigorous semi-automated data curation pipeline, with 22 domain experts dedicating 300 plus hours} to annotation, achieving a strong inter-annotator agreement (Cohen kappa = 0.78). We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), demonstrating that integrating textual and visual cues in multimodal news posts improves disinformation detection accuracy by 5 - 35 % compared to unimodal models. Developed in alignment with AI governance frameworks such as the EU AI Act, NIST guidelines, and the MIT AI Risk Repository 2024, VLDBench is expected to become a benchmark for detecting disinformation in online multi-modal contents. Our code and data will be publicly available.
- **Summary**: VLDBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for detecting disinformation in both unimodal (text-only) and multimodal (text and image) news articles.  It contains 31,339 news article-image pairs across 13 categories, curated from 58 diverse sources and meticulously annotated by 22 domain experts (Cohen's Îº = 0.78).  Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and VLMs demonstrates that integrating visual cues improves disinformation detection accuracy by 5â€“35%.  However, models show vulnerability to adversarial attacks targeting both text and images simultaneously.  The dataset and code are publicly available.

Score: 8

Rationale:

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** VLDBench addresses a crucial gap in the field by providing the first large-scale, human-verified benchmark specifically for *disinformation* detection in a multimodal context.  Existing datasets primarily focus on misinformation or lack comprehensive multimodal annotation.  The inclusion of 13 diverse news categories adds depth and realism.
* **Rigorous Methodology:** The semi-automated annotation pipeline, involving GPT-4 and extensive human validation, ensures high data quality and strong inter-annotator agreement.  The adversarial robustness testing provides valuable insights into model limitations.
* **Significant Findings:** The results clearly demonstrate the significant advantage of multimodal models over unimodal text-only models for disinformation detection.  The vulnerability to combined adversarial attacks highlights an important area for future research.
* **Accessibility:** The public availability of the data and code promotes reproducibility and fosters further research in the field.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Data Bias:** The reliance on pre-verified news sources might introduce sampling bias, potentially underrepresenting disinformation tactics from less regulated platforms.  The English-language focus also limits generalizability.
* **Annotation Bias:** Despite human validation, the use of LLMs in the annotation process carries a risk of inheriting existing biases.
* **Limited Adversarial Attacks:** While adversarial robustness is tested, the scope of adversarial attacks could be broadened to encompass a wider range of sophisticated techniques.
* **Lack of Explainability Focus:** While human evaluation assesses reasoning clarity, a deeper exploration into model explainability would strengthen the benchmark's utility.


Despite these weaknesses, VLDBench represents a substantial contribution to the field. Its size, quality, and focus on a critical and timely problem make it a valuable resource for advancing research and development in disinformation detection.  The clear demonstration of the benefits of multimodal approaches and the identification of vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks are highly significant.  The paper's impact will be felt most strongly in the development of more robust and effective disinformation detection systems, leading to a more informed and resilient information ecosystem.

### Teleportation With Null Space Gradient Projection for Optimization Acceleration
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11362v1)
- **Authors**: Zihao Wu, Juncheng Dong, Ahmed Aloui, Vahid Tarokh
- **Abstract**: Optimization techniques have become increasingly critical due to the ever-growing model complexity and data scale. In particular, teleportation has emerged as a promising approach, which accelerates convergence of gradient descent-based methods by navigating within the loss invariant level set to identify parameters with advantageous geometric properties. Existing teleportation algorithms have primarily demonstrated their effectiveness in optimizing Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), but their extension to more advanced architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, remains challenging. Moreover, they often impose significant computational demands, limiting their applicability to complex architectures. To this end, we introduce an algorithm that projects the gradient of the teleportation objective function onto the input null space, effectively preserving the teleportation within the loss invariant level set and reducing computational cost. Our approach is readily generalizable from MLPs to CNNs, transformers, and potentially other advanced architectures. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm across various benchmark datasets and optimizers, demonstrating its broad applicability.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel optimization acceleration algorithm based on "teleportation," a technique that navigates within loss-invariant level sets to find parameters with advantageous geometric properties.  Existing teleportation methods are limited to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and computationally expensive. This work addresses these limitations by projecting the teleportation objective's gradient onto the input null space of each layer. This projection preserves the teleportation within the loss-invariant level set while significantly reducing computational cost. The proposed method is generalizable to various architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers), and experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness with different optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adagrad, Adam). The key novelty lies in the efficient null space gradient projection, enabling broader applicability and scalability compared to previous teleportation approaches.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Improved Generalizability:** The most significant contribution is extending teleportation beyond MLPs to CNNs and Transformers, a major limitation of previous work. This expands the potential impact considerably.
* **Enhanced Efficiency:** The null space projection significantly reduces computational complexity, making teleportation feasible for larger, more complex architectures.  The empirical results showing linear scaling compared to previous exponential scaling are strong evidence of this.
* **Error Control:** The approach offers more control over errors introduced by approximating the level set, improving robustness.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes extensive experiments across various datasets, architectures, and optimizers, providing a strong empirical validation.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** The paper acknowledges the challenge of selecting optimal hyperparameters, a common issue in many machine learning algorithms.  Further investigation into robust hyperparameter tuning strategies would strengthen the work.
* **Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides empirical evidence, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm would enhance its credibility.  The claim of faster convergence rates requires more solid backing.
* **Comparison to Other Acceleration Techniques:**  The comparison is primarily with a previous teleportation method. A more comprehensive comparison against other state-of-the-art optimization acceleration techniques (e.g., AdamW, various momentum methods) is needed to fully assess its significance.


**Significance and Potential Influence:**

The paper tackles a relevant problem in deep learning optimization â€“ accelerating training for complex architectures. The proposed method shows promise in achieving this goal with improved efficiency and generalizability.  The extension to CNNs and Transformers is a substantial advancement.  However, the lack of thorough theoretical analysis and limited comparison with other acceleration methods somewhat diminishes its overall impact.  The work opens up avenues for further research in teleportation methods and optimization acceleration strategies.


Score: 7

**Rationale:**  The paper makes a substantial contribution by generalizing teleportation and improving its efficiency. The empirical results are compelling. However,  the limitations regarding hyperparameter tuning and the lack of a more comprehensive theoretical and comparative analysis prevent it from achieving a higher score.  Further work addressing these weaknesses could significantly boost its impact and potentially raise the score to 8 or 9.

### Blessing of Multilinguality: A Systematic Analysis of Multilingual In-Context Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11364v1)
- **Authors**: Yilei Tu, Andrew Xue, Freda Shi
- **Abstract**: While multilingual large language models generally perform adequately, and sometimes even rival English performance on high-resource languages (HRLs), they often significantly underperform on low-resource languages (LRLs). Among several prompting strategies aiming at bridging the gap, multilingual in-context learning (ICL) has been particularly effective when demonstration in target languages is unavailable. However, there lacks a systematic understanding when and why it works well. In this work, we systematically analyze multilingual ICL, using demonstrations in HRLs to enhance cross-lingual transfer. We show that demonstrations in mixed HRLs consistently outperform English-only ones across the board, particularly for tasks written in LRLs. Surprisingly, our ablation study show that the presence of irrelevant non-English sentences in the prompt yields measurable gains, suggesting the effectiveness of multilingual exposure itself. Our results highlight the potential of strategically leveraging multilingual resources to bridge the performance gap for underrepresented languages.
- **Summary**: This paper systematically investigates the impact of multilingual in-context learning (ICL) on the performance of multilingual large language models (MLLMs).  The authors find that using demonstrations in multiple high-resource languages (HRLs) consistently outperforms using English-only demonstrations, particularly for low-resource languages (LRLs).  Surprisingly, even adding irrelevant non-English sentences to an English-only prompt improves performance, suggesting the benefit of multilingual exposure itself.  The study uses several state-of-the-art LLMs and multilingual benchmarks across different domains, comparing English-only, monolingual HRL, multilingual HRL, and native-language ICL approaches.  The results highlight the robustness and effectiveness of multilingual ICL for bridging the performance gap between HRLs and LRLs, although native-language ICL remains superior when feasible.  The paper also briefly touches upon the performance of translation-based methods.


**Novelty and Significance Score Rationale:**

Score: 7

**Strengths:**

* **Systematic Evaluation:** The paper conducts a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple LLMs, datasets, and languages, providing strong evidence for its claims.  The controlled experimental design, including ablation studies on the impact of irrelevant sentences and different monolingual HRLs, strengthens the findings.
* **Important Finding:** The discovery that simply exposing the model to multiple languages, even irrelevant ones, improves performance is a novel and insightful finding that contributes to our understanding of how MLLMs learn.  This has implications for prompt engineering and data augmentation strategies.
* **Practical Relevance:** The findings have significant practical implications for improving the performance of LLMs on LRLs, a crucial area for broadening the accessibility and inclusivity of these technologies.  The multilingual ICL approach offers a feasible alternative to the often impractical native-language ICL.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Treats LLMs as Black Boxes:** The analysis focuses solely on input-output behavior without delving into the internal mechanisms of the LLMs. A deeper investigation of the internal representations and how multilingualism affects them would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution.
* **Limited Explanations:** While the paper suggests reasons for its findings, a more thorough investigation of the linguistic features (e.g., writing systems, grammatical structures) contributing to the observed performance differences is needed.  The neuron analysis is a starting point but lacks depth.
* **Not Groundbreaking:** While the findings are valuable and contribute to the field, they aren't fundamentally groundbreaking.  The general finding that multilingual data improves performance isn't entirely unexpected, and the superiority of native-language ICL is intuitive.


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's findings are likely to influence future research on multilingual ICL and prompt engineering. The results provide a strong argument for developing and utilizing multilingual prompting strategies, particularly when data for LRLs is scarce.  However, the lack of a deeper mechanistic understanding may limit its immediate impact on the development of new MLLM architectures. The paper's contribution lies mainly in its thorough empirical investigation and the surprising findings related to irrelevant multilingual context.

- **Authors**: Jack Gallifant, Shan Chen, Kuleen Sasse, Hugo Aerts, Thomas Hartvigsen, Danielle S. Bitterman
- **Abstract**: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide potentials for uncovering structured, human-interpretable representations in Large Language Models (LLMs), making them a crucial tool for transparent and controllable AI systems. We systematically analyze SAE for interpretable feature extraction from LLMs in safety-critical classification tasks. Our framework evaluates (1) model-layer selection and scaling properties, (2) SAE architectural configurations, including width and pooling strategies, and (3) the effect of binarizing continuous SAE activations. SAE-derived features achieve macro F1 > 0.8, outperforming hidden-state and BoW baselines while demonstrating cross-model transfer from Gemma 2 2B to 9B-IT models. These features generalize in a zero-shot manner to cross-lingual toxicity detection and visual classification tasks. Our analysis highlights the significant impact of pooling strategies and binarization thresholds, showing that binarization offers an efficient alternative to traditional feature selection while maintaining or improving performance. These findings establish new best practices for SAE-based interpretability and enable scalable, transparent deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. Full repo: https://github.com/shan23chen/MOSAIC.
- **Summary**: This paper systematically investigates the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract interpretable features from Large Language Models (LLMs) for classification tasks.  The authors evaluate various SAE architectures, pooling strategies, and binarization techniques, demonstrating that SAE-derived features consistently outperform baselines (hidden states and Bag-of-Words) across a range of safety-critical classification tasks and multiple languages.  A key finding is that binarizing SAE activations provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional feature selection methods without sacrificing performance.  Furthermore, the study explores the cross-modal transferability of text-trained SAE features to visual classification and the ability of smaller LLMs using SAE features to predict the behavior of larger models, suggesting a potential pathway for scalable model oversight.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes several valuable contributions, but its overall novelty and impact are somewhat limited by existing work in the field.

**Strengths:**

* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a remarkably thorough evaluation across multiple LLMs, datasets (including multilingual and multimodal), and SAE configurations.  This comprehensive approach strengthens the conclusions drawn.
* **Binarization as Feature Selection:** The finding that binarizing SAE activations improves efficiency without performance loss is a significant practical contribution.  This simplifies the feature extraction pipeline and enhances interpretability.
* **Cross-Model Prediction:**  The exploration of using smaller models with SAE features to predict the behavior of larger models is novel and potentially impactful for AI safety and oversight.  This is a relatively under-explored area.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Dependence on Pre-trained SAEs:** The reliance on pre-trained SAEs from a specific source (GemmaScope) limits the generalizability of the findings.  The paper acknowledges this limitation, but it significantly weakens the claim of establishing "best practices."
* **Incremental Novelty:** While the comprehensive evaluation is valuable, many individual components (SAE application to LLMs, multilingual transfer learning, etc.) have been explored in previous research. The paper's novelty stems from the combination and systematic comparison of these elements rather than groundbreaking new techniques.
* **Limited Depth of Interpretability Analysis:** While binarization improves interpretability, the paper doesn't delve deeply into the semantic meaning of the extracted features.  Understanding the actual concepts captured by these features is crucial for true interpretability.

**Potential Influence:**

The paper will likely be of interest to researchers working on LLM interpretability and feature extraction. The practical insights regarding SAE architectures and binarization could influence the development of more efficient and interpretable LLM applications. The findings on cross-model prediction could stimulate further research on scalable AI safety mechanisms.  However, the limited generalizability due to the reliance on pre-trained SAEs will restrict its broader impact.

**Score: 7**

The paper makes solid contributions, especially in its comprehensive evaluation and the practical finding on binarization.  However, the incremental nature of the novelty and the limitations in generalizability prevent it from being a truly exceptional contribution.  A score of 7 reflects its significant value while acknowledging its limitations within the existing literature.

### CCJA: Context-Coherent Jailbreak Attack for Aligned Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11379v1)
- **Authors**: Guanghao Zhou, Panjia Qiu, Mingyuan Fan, Cen Chen, Mingyuan Chu, Xin Zhang, Jun Zhou
- **Abstract**: Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can still be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as "jailbreaking." Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules. However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial. In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats. To address this research gap, we propose a novel \underline{C}ontext-\underline{C}oherent \underline{J}ailbreak \underline{A}ttack (CCJA). We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models. Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness. Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs. This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts. We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Context-Coherent Jailbreak Attack (CCJA), a novel method for attacking large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on open-source models.  Unlike existing methods that primarily rely on manual prompt engineering or lack semantic coherence, CCJA frames jailbreaking as an optimization problem within the embedding space of a masked language model (MLM).  This allows for the generation of semantically consistent jailbreak prompts that are more effective at eliciting harmful outputs.  The authors demonstrate CCJA's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines on several open-source LLMs, achieving higher success rates while maintaining better readability.  Furthermore, they show that integrating CCJA-generated prompts into existing black-box attack methods significantly improves their effectiveness against closed-source commercial LLMs, highlighting a potential security risk posed by open-source LLMs.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the growing field of LLM security.  The framing of the jailbreak attack as an optimization problem in the embedding space is novel and addresses a key limitation of previous methods: the lack of semantic coherence in generated prompts.  The use of an MLM head for decoding perturbed embeddings is clever and helps maintain grammaticality and meaning.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of CCJA over existing techniques across multiple open-source LLMs, and the extension to black-box attacks on commercial models is significant.  The ablation studies further support the design choices and demonstrate the effectiveness of the different components of CCJA.

However, the paper has some weaknesses.  The reliance on the AdvBench dataset, while common, might limit the generalizability of the findings. The paper also doesn't deeply explore the computational cost of CCJA compared to other white-box methods, especially in scenarios involving multiple models or queries.  The ethical implications of the work, while acknowledged, could benefit from a more extensive discussion.

Despite these minor weaknesses, the novelty of the approach, the strong experimental results, and the implications for LLM security justify a high score. The work offers a significant advance in understanding and tackling LLM vulnerabilities, providing a more sophisticated and effective method for evaluating and improving their safety.

### Exploring the Small World of Word Embeddings: A Comparative Study on Conceptual Spaces from LLMs of Different Scales
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11380v1)
- **Authors**: Zhu Liu, Ying Liu, KangYang Luo, Cunliang Kong, Maosong Sun
- **Abstract**: A conceptual space represents concepts as nodes and semantic relatedness as edges. Word embeddings, combined with a similarity metric, provide an effective approach to constructing such a space. Typically, embeddings are derived from traditional distributed models or encoder-only pretrained models, whose objectives directly capture the meaning of the current token. In contrast, decoder-only models, including large language models (LLMs), predict the next token, making their embeddings less directly tied to the current token's semantics. Moreover, comparative studies on LLMs of different scales remain underexplored. In this paper, we construct a conceptual space using word embeddings from LLMs of varying scales and comparatively analyze their properties. We establish a network based on a linguistic typology-inspired connectivity hypothesis, examine global statistical properties, and compare LLMs of varying scales. Locally, we analyze conceptual pairs, WordNet relations, and a cross-lingual semantic network for qualitative words. Our results indicate that the constructed space exhibits small-world properties, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and short path lengths. Larger LLMs generate more intricate spaces, with longer paths reflecting richer relational structures and connections. Furthermore, the network serves as an efficient bridge for cross-lingual semantic mapping.
- **Summary**: This paper explores the properties of conceptual spaces constructed from word embeddings derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) of varying scales.  The authors use Llama2-7B and Llama2-70B, creating a network where words are nodes and connections are weighted by cosine similarity between their embeddings.  A "minimum connectivity hypothesis" is employed to sparsify the complete graph, ensuring connectivity while minimizing edges.  The resulting networks exhibit small-world properties (high clustering coefficient, short path lengths).  Larger LLMs generate more complex spaces with longer paths, reflecting richer relationships.  The authors evaluate these spaces through three scenarios: comparing common concepts, analyzing WordNet relations, and examining a cross-lingual semantic network of qualitative words.  The results show that larger LLMs capture more nuanced relationships, and the overall approach demonstrates promising potential for cross-lingual semantic mapping.  However, limitations include the context-free treatment of words and the limited model scope.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution by applying network analysis to investigate the conceptual spaces implicitly encoded within LLMs.  The use of a minimum connectivity hypothesis for sparsification is a novel approach to constructing conceptual spaces from high-dimensional embeddings. The comparative analysis across different LLM scales is also a significant contribution, revealing how model size impacts the complexity and richness of the resulting conceptual representations.  The three scenarios provide a good level of empirical validation, demonstrating the spaces' alignment with human-annotated data.  The visualization of paths between word pairs further strengthens the analysis, illustrating the differences in relational complexity between the models.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  The core idea of using word embeddings to build conceptual spaces is not entirely new, though the application to LLMs and the focus on input embeddings add a layer of originality. The "minimum connectivity hypothesis," while presented as novel, feels like a straightforward application of established graph sparsification techniques adapted to the specific problem. The analysis mostly relies on fairly standard network metrics, and a more sophisticated exploration of the embeddingsâ€™ geometry or latent semantic relationships could have strengthened the findings.  The limitations acknowledged by the authors are significant and warrant further research.  Furthermore, a deeper exploration of potential biases within the LLM embeddings could have significantly enriched the discussion.


**Score: 7**

The score reflects the paper's strengths in methodology and comparative analysis, demonstrating a clear advance in understanding how LLMs represent concepts.  However, the lack of groundbreaking novelty in the core ideas, along with the acknowledged limitations, prevents it from achieving a higher score. The paper offers a valuable contribution but doesn't represent a transformative leap forward in the field.  Further work addressing the limitations and exploring more nuanced evaluation metrics could significantly enhance its impact.

- **Abstract**: Role-playing is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow diverse instructions while maintaining role identity and the role's pre-defined ability limits. Existing role-playing datasets mostly contribute to controlling role style and knowledge boundaries, but overlook role-playing in instruction-following scenarios. We introduce a fine-grained role-playing and instruction-following composite benchmark, named RoleMRC, including: (1) Multi-turn dialogues between ideal roles and humans, including free chats or discussions upon given passages; (2) Role-playing machine reading comprehension, involving response, refusal, and attempts according to passage answerability and role ability; (3) More complex scenarios with nested, multi-turn and prioritized instructions. The final RoleMRC features a 10.2k role profile meta-pool, 37.9k well-synthesized role-playing instructions, and 1.4k testing samples. We develop a pipeline to quantitatively evaluate the fine-grained role-playing and instruction-following capabilities of several mainstream LLMs, as well as models that are fine-tuned on our data. Moreover, cross-evaluation on external role-playing datasets confirms that models fine-tuned on RoleMRC enhances instruction-following without compromising general role-playing and reasoning capabilities. We also probe the neural-level activation maps of different capabilities over post-tuned LLMs. Access to our RoleMRC, RoleMRC-mix and Codes: https://github.com/LuJunru/RoleMRC.
- **Summary**: RoleMRC is a new benchmark dataset for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) role-playing and instruction-following capabilities.  It surpasses existing datasets by offering a fine-grained composite of three scenarios: free chats, on-scene machine reading comprehension (MRC) dialogues (including answerable, unanswerable, refusal, and attempt responses), and ruled chats with nested, multi-turn, and prioritized instructions.  RoleMRC includes 10.2k role profiles, 37.9k instructions, and 1.4k test samples.  The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation pipeline using both reference-based metrics and a reference-free LLM-as-a-judge approach, demonstrating that models fine-tuned on RoleMRC significantly improve performance without sacrificing general capabilities.  Furthermore, the authors probe neural activations to identify and mitigate an "alignment tax" observed in fine-tuning.


**Rigorous Rationale for Score:**

Score: 8

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** The combination of free chats, MRC-based dialogues with nuanced response types, and complex, multi-layered instructions in a single benchmark is a significant contribution. Existing datasets focus on individual aspects; RoleMRC provides a more holistic and challenging evaluation.
* **Scale:** The sheer size of the dataset (10.2k profiles, 37.9k instructions) is impressive and allows for robust evaluation.
* **Evaluation Methodology:** The use of both reference-based metrics and a reference-free LLM-as-a-judge approach mitigates biases inherent in relying solely on human judgment or automatic metrics.  The inclusion of the alignment tax analysis and neural probe work adds a layer of explainability and addresses a practical challenge in LLM fine-tuning.
* **Thorough Analysis:** The paper provides a detailed analysis of the results, comparing various LLMs and evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on both RoleMRC and external benchmarks.  The out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation further strengthens the claims.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Synthetic Data:**  The reliance on GPT-4 for data generation introduces potential biases. While the authors acknowledge this, a more thorough discussion of the limitations and potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.  Human evaluation of a subset of the generated data would also be beneficial.
* **Limited Generalizability of Prompts:** The paper mentions that the system-level prompts are somewhat similar, potentially limiting the generalizability of fine-tuned models. More diverse prompts would enhance the benchmark's robustness.
* **"Alignment Tax" Analysis:** While insightful, the neuron-level analysis focuses on a specific case (multi-turn instructions). A broader investigation across all task types within RoleMRC would provide more convincing evidence.  The method for mitigating the alignment tax seems somewhat ad-hoc.


**Potential Influence:**

RoleMRC has the potential to significantly influence the field by providing a more comprehensive and challenging benchmark for evaluating LLMsâ€™ role-playing and instruction-following abilities. Its fine-grained nature allows for a deeper understanding of model strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios.  The findings regarding the "alignment tax" and neural probe analysis could inspire future research into more efficient and effective fine-tuning strategies.  The dataset's availability will likely lead to further research and development in this important area.

### MARS: Mesh AutoRegressive Model for 3D Shape Detailization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11390v1)
- **Authors**: Jingnan Gao, Weizhe Liu, Weixuan Sun, Senbo Wang, Xibin Song, Taizhang Shang, Shenzhou Chen, Hongdong Li, Xiaokang Yang, Yichao Yan, Pan Ji
- **Abstract**: State-of-the-art methods for mesh detailization predominantly utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate detailed meshes from coarse ones. These methods typically learn a specific style code for each category or similar categories without enforcing geometry supervision across different Levels of Detail (LODs). Consequently, such methods often fail to generalize across a broader range of categories and cannot ensure shape consistency throughout the detailization process. In this paper, we introduce MARS, a novel approach for 3D shape detailization. Our method capitalizes on a novel multi-LOD, multi-category mesh representation to learn shape-consistent mesh representations in latent space across different LODs. We further propose a mesh autoregressive model capable of generating such latent representations through next-LOD token prediction. This approach significantly enhances the realism of the generated shapes. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging 3D Shape Detailization benchmark demonstrate that our proposed MARS model achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Notably, the model's capability to generate fine-grained details while preserving the overall shape integrity is particularly commendable.
- **Summary**: MARS: Mesh AutoRegressive Model for 3D Shape Detailization proposes a novel approach to 3D shape detailization using a multi-LOD, multi-category mesh representation and a mesh autoregressive model.  Unlike existing GAN-based methods that struggle with generalization across diverse shape categories and maintaining shape consistency across detail levels, MARS uses a VQVAE to encode meshes into discrete tokens at multiple LODs, employing a geometry-consistency supervision technique during training.  An autoregressive model then predicts finer LOD tokens from coarser ones, generating detailed meshes. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a 3D shape detailization benchmark, surpassing existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.  The key innovation lies in applying the autoregressive framework to 3D mesh detailization using a multi-LOD VQVAE.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The application of an autoregressive model for next-LOD token prediction in 3D shape detailization is a novel contribution. This differs significantly from existing GAN-based approaches.
* **Improved Generalization:** The multi-LOD, multi-category representation tackles the generalization limitations of previous methods, allowing for better performance across diverse shapes.
* **Shape Consistency:** The geometry-consistency supervision effectively addresses the problem of inconsistent shape across detail levels, a common issue with previous techniques.
* **Strong Empirical Results:**  The paper presents compelling qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating state-of-the-art performance compared to established baselines.
* **Comprehensive Ablation Study:**  The ablation study provides a thorough investigation of the key components of the MARS model, validating the effectiveness of the proposed design choices.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Dataset Details:** While the paper mentions a benchmark dataset, specific details about the dataset size, diversity, and data acquisition methods are lacking.  This limits the reproducibility and generalizability assessment of the results.
* **Computational Cost:** The computational cost of training and inference with the autoregressive model, especially for high-resolution meshes, is not explicitly discussed. This is a crucial aspect for practical applications.
* **Qualitative Subjectivity:** While the qualitative results are visually impressive, the assessment of "high-quality" geometric details remains somewhat subjective. More objective metrics could strengthen this aspect.
* **Comparison Limitations:**  Direct comparison with all state-of-the-art methods is not fully conducted; it focuses primarily on ShaDDR and DECOLLAGE. A more comprehensive comparison would enhance the paper's impact.



**Significance:**  MARS addresses a significant challenge in 3D shape generationâ€”the creation of high-fidelity details while preserving overall shape consistency. Its novel approach and strong empirical results position it as a potentially influential contribution to the field. The potential impact is high, as efficient and high-quality 3D shape detailization is crucial for various applications like game development, virtual reality, and computer-aided design.


**Score: 8**

The score reflects the paper's significant contributions. The novelty of applying the autoregressive framework to multi-LOD 3D shape detailization, the demonstrably improved generalization and shape consistency, and the strong empirical support are major strengths. However, the lack of complete dataset details, the unaddressed computational aspects, and the somewhat limited comparison scope prevent a perfect score.  Further investigation into these areas would solidify MARS's position as a leading method in the field.

### HellaSwag-Pro: A Large-Scale Bilingual Benchmark for Evaluating the Robustness of LLMs in Commonsense Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11393v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaoyuan Li, Moxin Li, Rui Men, Yichang Zhang, Keqin Bao, Wenjie Wang, Fuli Feng, Dayiheng Liu, Junyang Lin
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in commonsense reasoning; however, some variations in questions can trigger incorrect responses. Do these models truly understand commonsense knowledge, or just memorize expression patterns? To investigate this question, we present the first extensive robustness evaluation of LLMs in commonsense reasoning. We introduce HellaSwag-Pro, a large-scale bilingual benchmark consisting of 11,200 cases, by designing and compiling seven types of question variants. To construct this benchmark, we propose a two-stage method to develop Chinese HellaSwag, a finely annotated dataset comprising 12,000 instances across 56 categories. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 representative LLMs, revealing that these LLMs are far from robust in commonsense reasoning. Furthermore, this robustness varies depending on the language in which the LLM is tested. This work establishes a high-quality evaluation benchmark, with extensive experiments offering valuable insights to the community in commonsense reasoning for LLMs.
- **Summary**: HellaSwag-Pro is a new large-scale bilingual (English and Chinese) benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in commonsense reasoning.  It builds upon the HellaSwag benchmark by introducing seven types of question variants (problem restatement, reverse conversion, causal inference, sentence ordering, scenario refinement, negative transformation, and critical testing), systematically probing LLMs' ability to generalize beyond simple pattern matching.  The paper details a two-stage methodology for creating the Chinese HellaSwag dataset, which was then used, along with its English counterpart, to construct HellaSwag-Pro.  Extensive experiments on 41 LLMs reveal that even the most advanced models are far from robust, particularly struggling with negative transformations and scenario refinements. The study also highlights the impact of language and prompting strategies on LLM performance.

**Rigorous Rationale and Novelty Score:**

Score: 7

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Benchmark:** HellaSwag-Pro is a significant contribution due to its size, bilingual nature, and comprehensive exploration of diverse question variants. This addresses a critical gap in evaluating LLM robustness beyond simple accuracy on standard benchmarks. The inclusion of Chinese data is particularly valuable for evaluating the performance of multilingual models.  The seven variant types offer a more nuanced assessment of commonsense reasoning capabilities than prior work.
* **Thorough Methodology:** The paper details a well-defined, multi-stage approach to dataset construction, incorporating both automated generation (using LLMs) and human verification to ensure high quality and difficulty. The use of adversarial filtering to improve the challenge presented by the dataset is also noteworthy.
* **Extensive Experimentation:**  The evaluation on 41 LLMs with multiple prompting strategies provides a robust and comprehensive analysis of LLM performance.  The findings clearly demonstrate the limitations of current LLMs in robust commonsense reasoning.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Explanation of Underlying Reasons:** While the paper identifies challenging variant types, it provides limited analysis of *why* these types are particularly difficult for LLMs. A deeper dive into the reasons behind model failure would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution.
* **Focus on Multiple-Choice Questions:**  The reliance on multiple-choice questions might limit the generalizability of the findings to open-ended commonsense reasoning tasks.
* **Potential for Bias:**  The paper acknowledges potential biases in the dataset, but a more detailed discussion of mitigation strategies and an assessment of potential bias in the results would be beneficial.  The method for ensuring no social biases in the dataset isn't fully described.


**Overall Significance:** HellaSwag-Pro provides a valuable benchmark for future research in LLM commonsense reasoning.  The findings highlight the significant challenges that remain in developing truly robust and generalizable models. The impact of the paper will depend on the community's adoption of the benchmark and subsequent research built upon it.  While the paperâ€™s contribution is substantial, the lack of deeper analysis of the model failures and some methodological limitations prevent it from achieving a higher score.

### Revisiting Robust RAG: Do We Still Need Complex Robust Training in the Era of Powerful LLMs?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11400v1)
- **Authors**: Hanxing Ding, Shuchang Tao, Liang Pang, Zihao Wei, Liwei Chen, Kun Xu, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems often suffer from performance degradation when encountering noisy or irrelevant documents, driving researchers to develop sophisticated training strategies to enhance their robustness against such retrieval noise. However, as large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the necessity of these complex training methods is increasingly questioned. In this paper, we systematically investigate whether complex robust training strategies remain necessary as model capacity grows. Through comprehensive experiments spanning multiple model architectures and parameter scales, we evaluate various document selection methods and adversarial training techniques across diverse datasets. Our extensive experiments consistently demonstrate that as models become more powerful, the performance gains brought by complex robust training methods drop off dramatically. We delve into the rationale and find that more powerful models inherently exhibit superior confidence calibration, better generalization across datasets (even when trained with randomly selected documents), and optimal attention mechanisms learned with simpler strategies. Our findings suggest that RAG systems can benefit from simpler architectures and training strategies as models become more powerful, enabling more scalable applications with minimal complexity.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the necessity of complex robust training techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in light of increasingly powerful Large Language Models (LLMs).  The authors find that while such techniques (e.g., careful document selection, adversarial training) significantly improve the robustness of smaller LLMs, their benefits diminish considerably as model size and capabilities increase.  Experiments across various LLMs and datasets show that larger models exhibit better inherent confidence calibration, improved generalization across datasets, and effective attention mechanisms even when trained with randomly selected documents.  The authors conclude that simpler training strategies may suffice for powerful LLMs, leading to more efficient and scalable RAG applications.  This is supported by analysis of confidence scores, cross-dataset generalization, attention patterns, and training convergence speed.  The paper suggests simplified architecture design, opportunities for scalable open-domain applications, and new theoretical perspectives on model scaling laws as future research directions.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper presents a valuable empirical investigation into a significant practical challenge in RAG systems. The finding that complex robust training becomes less necessary with larger LLMs is insightful and potentially impactful for the field.  The extensive experiments across diverse models and datasets strengthen the findings.  The analysis of confidence calibration, generalization, and attention mechanisms provides a plausible explanation for the observed phenomenon. The suggestions for simplified architectures and scalable open-domain applications are practical and relevant.

However, some limitations exist. The focus on dense transformer models restricts the generalizability of the findings.  A deeper dive into the *mechanisms* behind the diminishing returns of complex training, rather than just correlational evidence, would enhance the paper's contribution.  The paper also doesn't explore potential trade-offs; while simpler training might be sufficient for many tasks, are there any accuracy losses, or scenarios where complex training remains vital for specific applications requiring extremely high accuracy or robustness? The "random document" approach, while surprisingly effective, might be a symptom of data biases present in the datasets rather than inherent model robustness.  Further exploration into this nuance is necessary.

Despite these limitations, the paper's contribution is significant, offering a potential paradigm shift in how we train and deploy RAG systems. The findings have clear practical implications for resource allocation and system design.


Score: 8

The score reflects the paper's strong empirical evidence, insightful findings, and practical implications.  The limitations, while noted, do not completely diminish the significant contribution of this work. The paper offers a compelling argument and directions for future research in RAG, paving the way for more efficient and scalable systems.

### ToolCoder: A Systematic Code-Empowered Tool Learning Framework for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11404v1)
- **Authors**: Hanxing Ding, Shuchang Tao, Liang Pang, Zihao Wei, Jinyang Gao, Bolin Ding, Huawei Shen, Xueqi Chen
- **Abstract**: Tool learning has emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks through interaction with external tools. Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.
- **Summary**: ToolCoder is a novel framework for large language model (LLM) tool learning that reformulates the process as a code generation task.  Instead of relying on natural language planning, ToolCoder translates natural language queries into structured Python function scaffolds.  These scaffolds are then systematically broken down into subtasks with descriptive comments, allowing the LLM to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. The LLM generates and executes the code, storing successful functions in a repository for reuse and using Python's error traceback mechanism for debugging.  Experiments show ToolCoder outperforms existing methods in task completion accuracy and execution reliability across multiple benchmarks.  The authors also conduct ablation studies demonstrating the contribution of each component (code scaffolding, reusable function repository, and error reflection).  The approach is further evaluated using open-source LLMs and a real-world API task dataset.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

ToolCoder presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM tool learning.  The code-centric approach offers several advantages over existing text-based methods: improved multi-step planning, precise error diagnosis, and efficient code reuse. The systematic framework, inspired by software engineering principles, enhances the robustness and reliability of the system. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate ToolCoder's superior performance.  The ablation studies are also a strength, providing evidence for the effectiveness of each component. The evaluation on open-source LLMs and the real-world API dataset strengthens the generalizability claims.

However, the paper's limitations should be acknowledged. The heavy reliance on well-documented APIs limits its applicability to real-world scenarios with incomplete or inconsistent documentation. The global planning strategy lacks flexibility for dynamic environments. Scalability issues might arise with extremely complex tasks involving many interdependent tools.  While the paper addresses these limitations in its discussion,  future work explicitly addressing these points would further strengthen the contribution.

Despite these limitations, the core idea of using a code-centric approach for LLM tool learning is novel and impactful.  The framework's clear structure and the strong experimental evidence suggest a significant advancement in the field.  The potential for broader adoption and further research based on this framework is high.

### LayAlign: Enhancing Multilingual Reasoning in Large Language Models via Layer-Wise Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Strategy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11405v1)
- **Authors**: Zhiwen Ruan, Yixia Li, He Zhu, Longyue Wang, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang, Yun Chen, Guanhua Chen
- **Abstract**: Despite being pretrained on multilingual corpora, large language models (LLMs) exhibit suboptimal performance on low-resource languages. Recent approaches have leveraged multilingual encoders alongside LLMs by introducing trainable parameters connecting the two models. However, these methods typically focus on the encoder's output, overlooking valuable information from other layers. We propose \aname (\mname), a framework that integrates representations from all encoder layers, coupled with the \attaname mechanism to enable layer-wise interaction between the LLM and the multilingual encoder. Extensive experiments on multilingual reasoning tasks, along with analyses of learned representations, show that our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines.
- **Summary**: LayAlign is a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating representations from all layers of a multilingual encoder.  Unlike previous methods that only utilize the top encoder layer, LayAlign uses a layer-wise adaptive fusion and alignment strategy, combining representations with distinct weights for each LLM layer.  This fusion is incorporated via an adaptive fusion-enhanced attention mechanism that combines self-attention and cross-attention, modulated by learnable gate parameters.  The model is trained in two stages: a translation stage for representation alignment and a task stage for downstream task fine-tuning.  Experiments on mathematical and commonsense reasoning tasks demonstrate that LayAlign outperforms existing baselines, particularly for low-resource languages, while maintaining strong performance for high-resource languages.  Ablation studies highlight the contribution of each component.  Analyses of the learned representation space show improved alignment across languages.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

LayAlign presents a valuable contribution to the field of multilingual LLM adaptation, addressing a critical limitation of existing methods.  The core idea of leveraging all encoder layers rather than just the top layer is intuitively appealing and empirically validated. The adaptive fusion-enhanced attention mechanism adds a layer of sophistication, allowing the model to dynamically weight the contributions of different encoder layers. The two-stage training process is also well-justified.

However, the paper's novelty is not groundbreaking. The core conceptsâ€”layer-wise fusion, adaptive attention mechanisms, and two-stage trainingâ€”are not entirely new in the broader machine learning literature. The specific combination and application to multilingual LLMs are certainly contributions, but they are incremental rather than revolutionary.  The paper also relies heavily on comparing to existing methods using similar setups and data. This makes it harder to isolate the specific contribution of LayAlign itself.  The extensive experimental results are a strength, but a more in-depth analysis of the learned representations, possibly with visualization techniques beyond PCA, would strengthen the claims of improved alignment.

While the improvements in performance are significant, the paper doesn't thoroughly address potential limitations. The dependence on a strong multilingual encoder is a constraint.  The computational cost of training, though reported, could be further discussed in the context of scalability and accessibility.

Overall, the paper represents a solid and significant advancement in the field, but it's not a paradigm shift. It provides a well-justified and empirically supported approach to improving multilingual LLM performance, but its novelty is incremental rather than transformative.

### Detecting and Filtering Unsafe Training Data via Data Attribution
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11411v1)
- **Authors**: Yijun Pan, Taiwei Shi, Jieyu Zhao, Jiaqi W. Ma
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to unsafe training data that even small amounts of unsafe data can lead to harmful model behaviors. Detecting and filtering such unsafe training data is essential for trustworthy model development. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches typically rely on training moderation classifiers which requires significant computational overhead and are limited to predefined taxonomies, making them less adaptable to evolving safety concerns. Moreover, these classifiers lack insight into the training process, limiting their effectiveness in filtering unsafe data. To address these limitations, we propose DABUF, leveraging data attribution to detect and filter unsafe training data by attributing harmful model outputs to influential training data points. DABUF enables flexible identification of various unsafe data types without predefined taxonomies. However, in practice, model outputs can be complex with combined safe linguistic features and unsafe content, leading to reduced attribution accuracy. In such cases, DABUF will integrate moderation classifiers to identify a minimal subset of unsafe training data for targeted attribution (such as jailbreak). When model outputs are relatively straightforward, DABUF uses model outputs directly as the attribution targets. We evaluate the performance on two different tasks: in filtering jailbreaking training data and in identifying and mitigating gender bias. DABUF outperforms SOTA approaches by up to 7.5\% in detection AUPRC in jailbreaking scenarios, and 44.1\% in detecting gender bias. Moreover, retraining on DABUF-filtered data leads to higher model safety across experiments, underscoring its versatility in addressing a broad spectrum of unsafe data issues.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces DABUF, a novel method for detecting and filtering unsafe training data in Large Language Models (LLMs).  DABUF leverages data attribution techniques to identify training data points that disproportionately influence harmful model outputs.  Unlike existing methods relying on pre-trained moderation classifiers, DABUF adapts to various types of unsafe data without predefined taxonomies.  To address the noise introduced by complex model outputs, DABUF integrates moderation classifiers for initial filtering in scenarios like jailbreaking, refining the attribution process.  Experiments on jailbreaking and gender bias mitigation demonstrate DABUF's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to a 7.5% improvement in detection AUPRC for jailbreaking and a 44.1% improvement in detecting gender bias.  Retraining models with DABUF-filtered data resulted in significantly improved model safety.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the crucial area of LLM safety.  The core idea of using data attribution to identify unsafe training data is innovative and addresses a significant limitation of current methods which rely heavily on pre-defined taxonomies and computationally expensive retraining. The two-stage approach (using moderation classifiers for initial filtering when necessary) cleverly tackles the challenge of noisy attribution signals from complex model outputs. The empirical results, showing consistent improvement over existing techniques in both jailbreaking and gender bias scenarios, are compelling.

However, several weaknesses warrant consideration:

* **Scalability:** While the paper mentions computational efficiency improvements, the scalability of DABUF to extremely large LLMs and datasets remains unclear.  The computational cost of data attribution, even with optimizations, could still be prohibitive for models with billions of parameters.
* **Generalizability:**  The success of DABUF relies on the accuracy of the initial moderation classifier in the two-stage approach.  The performance may degrade if the moderation classifier is inaccurate or poorly suited to the specific type of unsafe data. The paper acknowledges this but doesn't thoroughly explore the sensitivity to the choice of the moderation classifier.
* **Adversarial Robustness:** The authors acknowledge the potential for adversarial attacks to manipulate attribution scores. This is a critical limitation that needs further investigation.  The paper's claims about robustness need stronger justification and potential mitigation strategies.
* **Data Dependency:**  The performance is heavily reliant on the quality and representativeness of the target dataset (Dtarget). The paper needs clearer guidelines on how to effectively construct this dataset.

Despite these weaknesses, the novelty of the approach, the strong empirical evidence, and the clear identification of limitations make this a significant contribution. The proposed method offers a promising avenue for enhancing LLM safety.  The paper's impact will depend on future work addressing scalability and adversarial robustness concerns.

### DiSCo: Device-Server Collaborative LLM-Based Text Streaming Services
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11417v1)
- **Authors**: Ting Sun, Penghan Wang, Fan Lai
- **Abstract**: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in text streaming services has introduced significant cost and Quality of Experience (QoE) challenges in serving millions of daily requests, especially in meeting Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Token (TBT) requirements for real-time interactions. Our real-world measurements show that both server-based and on-device deployments struggle to meet diverse QoE demands: server deployments face high costs and last-hop issues (e.g., Internet latency and dynamics), while on-device LLM inference is constrained by resources. We introduce DiSCo, a device-server cooperative scheduler designed to optimize users' QoE by adaptively routing requests and migrating response generation between endpoints while maintaining cost constraints. DiSCo employs cost-aware scheduling, leveraging the predictable speed of on-device LLM inference with the flexible capacity of server-based inference to dispatch requests on the fly, while introducing a token-level migration mechanism to ensure consistent token delivery during migration. Evaluations on real-world workloads -- including commercial services like OpenAI GPT and DeepSeek, and open-source deployments such as LLaMA3 -- show that DiSCo can improve users' QoE by reducing tail TTFT (11-52\%) and mean TTFT (6-78\%) across different model-device configurations, while dramatically reducing serving costs by up to 84\% through its migration mechanism while maintaining comparable QoE levels.
- **Summary**: DiSCo is a novel device-server collaborative scheduler for LLM-based text streaming services designed to optimize Quality of Experience (QoE) while managing costs.  Existing solutions, either server-based or on-device, struggle to meet diverse QoE demands (Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and Time-Between-Token (TBT)) and cost constraints. DiSCo addresses this by adaptively routing requests and migrating response generation between devices and servers.  It uses cost-aware dispatching policies (length-threshold and delay-based) and a token-level migration framework to ensure consistent token delivery during migration.  Evaluations on real-world workloads show significant improvements in TTFT (11-52% tail, 6-78% mean) and cost reductions up to 84%, while maintaining comparable TBT.  The paper highlights the predictable nature of on-device inference and the flexible capacity of server-based inference as key advantages leveraged by DiSCo.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

DiSCo presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM serving, tackling a crucial problem of balancing cost and QoE in real-time applications. The proposed solution is well-motivated, addressing limitations of existing on-device and server-only approaches. The design of DiSCo, incorporating cost-aware dispatching and token-level migration, is innovative and technically sound. The experimental evaluation is extensive, using real-world traces from various commercial LLMs and open-source models, strengthening the claims of improved performance and cost savings.  The ablation study further clarifies the individual contributions of the different components.

However, some limitations exist. The energy model used for on-device computation is simplified, neglecting factors like battery state and temperature.  The scalability analysis is limited to single-device scenarios, potentially underestimating the challenges of deploying DiSCo in more complex, multi-device environments. While the paper addresses response quality, a more in-depth analysis comparing DiSCo's generated text quality to the baselines across various tasks and prompts would further strengthen the findings. The assumption of readily-available server TTFT distribution might be unrealistic in all scenarios.


Considering the strengths and weaknesses, DiSCo represents a significant advancement in LLM serving. The combination of a well-defined problem, innovative solution, rigorous evaluation, and practical impact on a critical area within the field warrants a high score.

### TimeCAP: Learning to Contextualize, Augment, and Predict Time Series Events with Large Language Model Agents
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11418v1)
- **Authors**: Geon Lee, Wenchao Yu, Kijung Shin, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen
- **Abstract**: Time series data is essential in various applications, including climate modeling, healthcare monitoring, and financial analytics. Understanding the contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.
- **Summary**: TimeCAP is a framework for time series event prediction that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) in a novel way.  Instead of directly using LLMs as predictors, TimeCAP employs two LLM agents: one to generate a contextual textual summary of the time series data, and another to use this enriched summary for prediction.  Furthermore, a multi-modal encoder synergizes with the LLM agents, enhancing performance through mutual augmentation (input augmentation by the textual summary, and prompt augmentation by using the encoder's embeddings to select relevant training examples).  Experiments on real-world datasets show significant improvements (average 28.75% in F1 score) over state-of-the-art methods, including those using LLMs as direct predictors.  The framework also offers interpretability through different prompting strategies for rationale generation.

* **Novel Approach:** The dual-agent LLM architecture combined with the multi-modal encoder is a novel approach to time series prediction.  It cleverly utilizes LLMs' strengths in contextual understanding, a factor often overlooked in traditional time series methods. The mutual augmentation strategy is also a significant contribution.
* **Strong Empirical Results:** The paper reports substantial improvements in F1 score compared to a range of baselines, including other LLM-based approaches. This provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
* **Interpretability:**  The inclusion of methods for generating rationales enhances the transparency and trustworthiness of the model's predictions, a crucial aspect often lacking in black-box models.
* **Data Contribution:** The release of the datasets used in the study is beneficial for the research community.

**Weaknesses:**

* **LLM Dependence:** The performance heavily relies on the capabilities of LLMs.  The choice of specific LLMs (GPT-4 and BERT) might limit generalizability.  The paper doesn't thoroughly explore the sensitivity to different LLM architectures or sizes.
* **Computational Cost:** Using two LLMs and a trainable multi-modal encoder likely incurs significant computational cost, making it potentially less accessible to researchers with limited resources. The paper does not discuss computational complexity or scalability in detail.
* **Limited Ablation Study Depth:** While ablation studies are performed, more detailed analysis of individual components' contribution would strengthen the paper.  For instance, a more granular investigation into the impact of the number of in-context examples (k) or the fusion parameter (Î») is missing.
* **Generalizability Concerns:** Although the authors claim the framework is compatible with LMaaS, the practical implications for different APIs need further investigation.

**Significance and Potential Influence:**

TimeCAP presents a promising approach that bridges the gap between LLMs and time series analysis.  Its strong empirical results and focus on interpretability make it a valuable contribution.  However, the computational cost and reliance on specific LLMs are limitations. The potential impact lies in its ability to inspire further research into combining LLMs with other data modalities for improved time series modeling, as well as advancing the interpretability of these increasingly complex models.

Score: 8

**Rationale:** The novelty of the dual-agent LLM approach, combined with strong empirical results and efforts towards interpretability, warrants a high score. However, the limitations regarding computational cost, generalizability, and the depth of the ablation studies prevent it from achieving a perfect score.  The paper's potential impact on the field is significant, suggesting further refinement and broader adoption is likely.

### InsBank: Evolving Instruction Subset for Ongoing Alignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11419v1)
- **Authors**: Jiayi Shi, Yiwei Li, Shaoxiong Feng, Peiwen Yuan, Xinglin Wang, Yueqi Zhang, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Huan Ren, Yao Hu, Kan Li
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) typically undergo instruction tuning to enhance alignment. Recent studies emphasize that quality and diversity of instruction data are more crucial than quantity, highlighting the need to select diverse, high-quality subsets to reduce training costs. However, how to evolve these selected subsets alongside the development of new instruction data remains insufficiently explored. To achieve LLMs' ongoing alignment, we introduce Instruction Bank (InsBank), a continuously updated repository that integrates the latest valuable instruction data. We further propose Progressive Instruction Bank Evolution (PIBE), a novel framework designed to evolve InsBank effectively and efficiently over time. PIBE employs a gradual data selection strategy to maintain long-term efficiency, leveraging a representation-based diversity score to capture relationships between data points and retain historical information for comprehensive diversity evaluation. This also allows for flexible combination of diversity and quality scores during data selection and ranking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIBE significantly outperforms baselines in InsBank evolution and is able to extract budget-specific subsets, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.
- **Summary**: InsBank: Evolving Instruction Subset for Ongoing Alignment proposes a dynamic framework for continuously updating the instruction dataset used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs).  Existing methods typically select a static instruction subset; InsBank, however, evolves this subset as new data becomes available, maintaining an optimal size and balance of quality and diversity.  The core of InsBank is PIBE (Progressive Instruction Bank Evolution), a framework using a gradual data selection strategy and a novel representation-based diversity score leveraging Affinity Propagation to efficiently incorporate new data while retaining valuable information from older data.  Experiments demonstrate that PIBE outperforms baselines in terms of fine-tuned model performance across various benchmarks, showcasing InsBank's effectiveness in maintaining a high-quality, diverse instruction subset for ongoing LLM alignment.


**Novelty and Significance Score Rationale:**

Score: 7

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a significant problem:** The paper tackles the crucial issue of maintaining up-to-date and efficient instruction datasets for continually improving LLM alignment.  The continuous evolution of instruction data is a real-world challenge, and this paper provides a practical solution.
* **Novel approach to diversity:** The use of Affinity Propagation and the momentum matrix to maintain diversity across evolving datasets is a novel contribution.  The representation-based diversity score addresses limitations of existing k-NN and coreset methods.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough evaluation across multiple LLMs and benchmark datasets.  The analysis of different score combination methods and hyperparameters strengthens the findings.
* **Practical implications:** The proposed method offers a practical solution for reducing the computational cost of instruction tuning while maintaining or improving model performance.  The orderliness of InsBank allows for flexible budget-specific subset selection.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational cost:** While the paper addresses efficiency, the use of Affinity Propagation remains computationally expensive, requiring batch processing. This limitation could hinder scalability to extremely large datasets.
* **Quality score reliance:** The method relies on an external quality scoring model (DEITA).  While the paper uses a standard approach, the performance is dependent on the accuracy of this external model.  Exploring alternative or integrated quality assessment methods would strengthen the approach.
* **Incremental contribution:** While the combination of techniques is novel, the individual components (e.g., gradual data selection, Affinity Propagation) are not entirely new. The novelty lies in their specific combination and application within the InsBank framework.


**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM alignment.  The novel combination of techniques in PIBE effectively addresses the challenges of evolving instruction datasets, providing a more efficient and adaptable approach to instruction tuning. However, the computational cost and reliance on an external quality score represent limitations that could impact its broader adoption.  The work is a significant step forward but doesn't represent a paradigm shift; therefore, a score of 7 is appropriate.

### Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11422v1)
- **Authors**: Chaoxu Mu, Xufeng Zhang, Hui Wang
- **Abstract**: Heuristics have achieved great success in solv- ing combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans re- quire too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language Mod- els (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to under- stand and generate content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel way to automatically optimize heuristics. There- fore, we propose Planning of Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self- reflection of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algo- rithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their performance and providing im- provement suggestions. Our method enables to it- eratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on the improvement sug- gestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards. In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Prob- lem (TSP) and the Flow Shop Scheduling Prob- lem (FSSP). The experimental results show that PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the signifi- cant improvements and the state-of-the-art per- formance of our proposed method in automating heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Planning of Heuristics (PoH), a novel method for automating heuristic optimization for combinatorial optimization problems (COPs).  PoH integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) for heuristic generation and improvement suggestions with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for strategic exploration of the heuristic search space.  The method iteratively refines heuristics based on performance evaluation (reward) and LLM-generated suggestions (actions).  Experiments on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSSP) demonstrate that PoH outperforms existing hand-crafted heuristics and other LLM-based automated heuristic design (AHD) methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark instances.  The authors highlight PoH's ability to scale to larger problem instances and its robustness across different LLMs.  Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the MCTS approach compared to simpler search strategies.

**Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a significant advance in automated heuristic design, combining several promising techniques in a novel way. The integration of LLMs for heuristic generation and MCTS for strategic search is a key strength. The empirical results, showing consistent outperformance on benchmark problems, are compelling.  The ablation studies and convergence analysis provide valuable insights into the method's behavior.  The qualitative analysis illustrating the iterative refinement process is also helpful.

However, several aspects could be strengthened. The reliance on relatively recent LLMs (GPT-4.0) might limit generalizability.  A more thorough discussion of the computational cost of PoH compared to other methods would be beneficial.  The paper mentions the potential for using cheaper simulation methods within MCTS for larger-scale problems, but this remains future work.  While the results are impressive, the specific details of hyperparameter tuning and potential sensitivity to these parameters are not fully explored.  Finally, the paper lacks a broader discussion of the limitations and potential failure cases of PoH.


Despite these minor weaknesses, the core contributionâ€”the effective combination of LLMs and MCTS for heuristic optimizationâ€”is highly novel and impactful. The strong empirical results suggest a significant potential for improving the solution of complex COPs.  The approach is likely to influence future research in AHD and inspire similar hybrid methods that combine the strengths of LLMs and efficient search algorithms.

### Exploring Persona Sentiment Sensitivity in Personalized Dialogue Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11423v1)
- **Authors**: YongHyun Jun, Hwanhee Lee
- **Abstract**: Personalized dialogue systems have advanced considerably with the integration of user-specific personas into large language models (LLMs). However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes, leading to increased entailment and contradiction instances and lower overall coherence. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother and more coherent interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of persona sentiment polarity on the quality of dialogues generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).  The authors conduct a large-scale analysis using the ConvAI2 dataset, creating polarized user profiles (positive, negative, mixed).  Their experiments reveal that negatively polarized profiles lead to dialogues that overemphasize persona attributes, resulting in contradictions and reduced coherence.  Conversely, positively polarized profiles produce more coherent and contextually appropriate dialogues.  Profiles with neutral or weak sentiment yielded lower-quality dialogues.  To address this, they propose a dialogue generation approach combining a turn-based strategy with a profile ordering mechanism, prioritizing profiles with neutral/weak sentiment first, followed by positive ones.  The study uses a variety of automated metrics for evaluation, including a novel perplexity gap metric and LLM-based evaluation.


**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of personalized dialogue systems, but its novelty is somewhat limited and its significance could be higher.

**Strengths:**

* **Systematic Investigation of Sentiment Impact:** The paper systematically explores the under-researched area of how persona sentiment affects LLM dialogue generation. The large-scale experiments with diverse LLMs and evaluation metrics enhance the robustness of the findings.
* **Practical Solution Proposed:** The proposed turn-based generation with profile ordering is a practical approach to mitigate the negative effects of negative persona sentiment.  It's a relatively simple yet potentially effective method.
* **Novel Metric:** The introduction of the perplexity gap metric offers a novel way to quantify the influence of persona profiles on dialogue generation.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Novelty:** While the focus on persona sentiment polarity is relatively novel, the core methods (turn-based generation, persona embedding in prompts) are established techniques in personalized dialogue systems.  The contribution lies in analyzing their interaction with sentiment, not introducing entirely new methods.
* **Reliance on Automated Metrics:** The heavy reliance on automated metrics, while efficient, raises concerns about their alignment with human judgment.  Human evaluation would significantly strengthen the conclusions.
* **Dataset Limitations:** The study's reliance on a single dataset limits the generalizability of the findings.  Results might vary across different datasets with diverse persona representations.


**Potential Influence:**

The findings could influence the design of personalized dialogue systems by prompting developers to consider the sentiment of user profiles and to employ strategies like the proposed turn-based approach with profile ordering to improve dialogue quality.  The perplexity gap metric could also find adoption in future research. However, the overall impact might be moderate due to the incremental nature of the proposed solution.

Score: 7


The score reflects the paper's solid contribution in exploring an important aspect of LLM dialogue generation, the practical solution proposed, and the introduction of a novel metric. However, the limited novelty of the core methods and the reliance on automated evaluation prevent it from achieving a higher score.  Further work incorporating human evaluation and broader dataset exploration would significantly enhance the paper's impact.

### Counterfactual-Consistency Prompting for Relative Temporal Understanding in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11425v1)
- **Authors**: Jongho Kim, Seung-won Hwang
- **Abstract**: Despite the advanced capabilities of large language models (LLMs), their temporal reasoning ability remains underdeveloped. Prior works have highlighted this limitation, particularly in maintaining temporal consistency when understanding events. For example, models often confuse mutually exclusive temporal relations like ``before'' and ``after'' between events and make inconsistent predictions. In this work, we tackle the issue of temporal inconsistency in LLMs by proposing a novel counterfactual prompting approach. Our method generates counterfactual questions and enforces collective constraints, enhancing the model's consistency. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in event ordering for explicit and implicit events and temporal commonsense understanding by effectively addressing temporal inconsistencies.
- **Summary**: This paper addresses the problem of temporal inconsistency in large language models (LLMs) when performing relative temporal reasoningâ€”inferring temporal relationships between events without explicit time markers.  Existing methods, including chain-of-thought prompting, often fail to maintain consistency.  The authors propose Counterfactual-Consistency Prompting (CCP), a novel method that generates counterfactual questions (e.g., changing "before" to "after") and uses the model's answers to these questions to constrain and refine its answer to the original question.  Experiments on three datasets (TempEvalQA-Bi, TRACIE, MCTACO) show that CCP significantly improves both accuracy and consistency in relative temporal understanding compared to various baselines, including those using multiple predictions or iterative refinement.  The authors also demonstrate that dynamically generating counterfactual questions is superior to retrieving them from a pre-existing set.  However, the method shows limitations when dealing with tasks involving explicit time indicators.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the growing field of LLM reasoning. The core idea of using counterfactual prompting to enforce temporal consistency is novel and addresses a significant limitation of current LLMs.  The experimental setup is relatively comprehensive, comparing CCP against multiple established baselines across diverse datasets. The introduction of the inconsistency metric is also a useful contribution to the evaluation of temporal reasoning.

However, some aspects warrant criticism.  The reliance on a "collective re-weighting" process, while intuitive, lacks a clear formal definition and might be prone to error propagation if the LLM fails to answer the counterfactual questions correctly.  The ablation study focusing on dynamically generated vs. retrieved counterfactuals is helpful, but a more nuanced analysis of the *quality* of the generated counterfactuals would strengthen the argument.  Finally, the acknowledged limitations regarding explicit time indicators and the sensitivity to prompt wording highlight a need for further development.

While the paper demonstrates a clear improvement in temporal consistency, the magnitude of the improvement varies across datasets and models.  The impact on real-world applications might not be immediately apparent, as the focus is on relatively simple temporal reasoning tasks.  The potential for scaling CCP to more complex temporal reasoning tasks remains to be explored.

Considering the novelty of the approach, the thorough experimentation, and the identification of clear limitations, this paper represents a significant step forward.

### \textsc{FLAG-Trader}: Fusion LLM-Agent with Gradient-based Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11433v1)
- **Authors**: Guojun Xiong, Zhiyang Deng, Keyi Wang, Yupeng Cao, Haohang Li, Yangyang Yu, Xueqing Peng, Mingquan Lin, Kaleb E Smith, Xiao-Yang Liu, Jimin Huang, Sophia Ananiadou, Qianqian Xie
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on multimodal financial data have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in various financial tasks. However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.
- **Summary**: FLAG-TRADER is a novel financial trading framework that integrates a large language model (LLM) with gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL).  It addresses limitations of traditional RL approaches in finance by leveraging the LLM's multimodal data processing capabilities and its ability to capture long-range dependencies.  Instead of fine-tuning the entire LLM, FLAG-TRADER employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning, focusing on a subset of the LLM's parameters to adapt it to the financial domain while preserving pre-trained knowledge.  The LLM acts as the policy network in an actor-critic architecture, generating trading actions (buy, sell, hold) based on structured textual representations of market data and portfolio status.  The policy is then optimized using policy gradient methods (PPO) driven by trading rewards (Sharpe ratio).  Experiments demonstrate that FLAG-TRADER, even with a relatively small 135M parameter LLM, outperforms both buy-and-hold strategies and baselines using larger, proprietary LLMs in terms of cumulative return and Sharpe ratio across multiple stocks and cryptocurrencies.  The paper highlights the potential of combining LLMs and RL for efficient and effective financial decision-making.  However, the computational cost remains high, and the framework's robustness to market volatility and non-stationarity, as well as potential biases introduced by the structured prompts, need further investigation.

Score: 7

Rationale:

Strengths:

* **Novelty:** The integration of parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning with RL for financial trading is a novel approach.  The use of a structured prompt to feed multimodal data to the LLM is also a valuable contribution.  The demonstration of a smaller LLM outperforming larger models is impressive.
* **Significance:** The results showing improved performance over baselines, especially the surprising success of a smaller model, are significant and could influence future research in this area.  The focus on Sharpe ratio as a reward signal is appropriate for financial applications.
* **Clarity:** The paper is generally well-written and clearly explains the proposed method and results.

Weaknesses:

* **Limited Generalizability:** While the results are promising, the experiments are limited to a specific set of assets and a relatively short time period.  The generalizability of the approach to other markets and longer time horizons needs further validation.
* **Computational Cost:** The authors acknowledge the high computational cost, which is a significant limitation for practical deployment.  Further research to address this is needed.
* **Bias and Robustness:** The reliance on structured prompts could introduce biases, and the robustness to market volatility and non-stationarity is not fully addressed.  A more comprehensive analysis of these aspects is required.
* **Lack of Deep Dive into PPO Implementation:** While the authors mention using PPO, details on hyperparameter tuning and the specific PPO implementation are scarce, limiting reproducibility and a thorough understanding of the algorithm's contribution.


Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution by demonstrating the potential of combining LLMs and RL for financial trading. However,  the limitations regarding generalizability, computational cost, and robustness prevent a higher score.  Addressing these weaknesses through further research will be crucial for establishing the broader impact of FLAG-TRADER.

### ADO: Automatic Data Optimization for Inputs in LLM Prompts
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11436v1)
- **Authors**: Sam Lin, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Zhenting Wang, Yongfeng Zhang
- **Abstract**: This study explores a novel approach to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the optimization of input data within prompts. While previous research has primarily focused on refining instruction components and augmenting input data with in-context examples, our work investigates the potential benefits of optimizing the input data itself. We introduce a two-pronged strategy for input data optimization: content engineering and structural reformulation. Content engineering involves imputing missing values, removing irrelevant attributes, and enriching profiles by generating additional information inferred from existing attributes. Subsequent to content engineering, structural reformulation is applied to optimize the presentation of the modified content to LLMs, given their sensitivity to input format. Our findings suggest that these optimizations can significantly improve the performance of LLMs in various tasks, offering a promising avenue for future research in prompt engineering. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ADO-6BC5/
- **Summary**: This paper introduces ADO (Automatic Data Optimization), a novel framework for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance by optimizing the input data within prompts.  ADO employs a two-pronged strategy: content engineering (imputing missing values, removing irrelevant attributes, enriching profiles) and structural reformulation (optimizing data presentation).  The framework uses three LLMs: one to generate data optimization instructions, one to execute them, and one for task inference.  A novel algorithm, Diverse Prompt Search (DPS), is proposed to improve the diversity of generated optimization instructions. Experiments across nine datasets show that ADO consistently improves LLM performance, especially when combined with other prompt engineering techniques.  An ablation study demonstrates the importance of both content and structural optimization, as well as the benefits of incorporating a factual-validation LLM to mitigate hallucinations.

**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of prompt engineering, exploring a relatively under-researched area: input data optimization.  The proposed ADO framework and DPS algorithm are novel and offer a systematic approach to improving LLM performance by focusing on a previously neglected aspect of prompt engineering.  The use of LLMs to automate the optimization process is a significant advancement, potentially reducing the reliance on human expertise and accelerating the data preparation phase.  The ablation study provides further insights into the individual components of the framework.  The experiments on diverse datasets and LLMs enhance the generalizability of the findings.

However, some weaknesses exist. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach, particularly the computational cost associated with using multiple LLMs.  The selection of specific LLMs could be further justified, and a comparison with simpler data preprocessing methods would strengthen the claims of superiority.  While the DPS algorithm aims to address prompt diversity, a more rigorous quantitative analysis of the diversity achieved could be beneficial. The description of Bayesian Search integration is somewhat brief, lacking specifics on the hyperparameter optimization process.


Despite these minor weaknesses, the overall contribution is substantial.  The paper tackles a significant problem, proposes a novel solution, and provides empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness.  It opens up new avenues for research in prompt engineering and has the potential to significantly impact how input data is prepared and presented for LLM-based applications.

### SAFE-SQL: Self-Augmented In-Context Learning with Fine-grained Example Selection for Text-to-SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11438v1)
- **Authors**: Jimin Lee, Ingeol Baek, Byeongjeong Kim, Hwanhee Lee
- **Abstract**: Text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. While previous approaches, such as skeleton-masked selection, have demonstrated strong performance by retrieving similar training examples to guide large language models (LLMs), they struggle in real-world scenarios where such examples are unavailable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Self-Augmentation in-context learning with Fine-grained Example selection for Text-to-SQL (SAFE-SQL), a novel framework that improves SQL generation by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. SAFE-SQL first prompts an LLM to generate multiple Text-to-SQL examples relevant to the test input. Then SAFE-SQL filters these examples through three relevance assessments, constructing high-quality in-context learning examples. Using self-generated examples, SAFE-SQL surpasses the previous zero-shot, and few-shot Text-to-SQL frameworks, achieving higher execution accuracy. Notably, our approach provides additional performance gains in extra hard and unseen scenarios, where conventional methods often fail.
- **Summary**: SAFE-SQL is a novel framework for Text-to-SQL that addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely on retrieving similar training examples.  Unlike these retrieval-based approaches, which struggle when relevant examples are unavailable, SAFE-SQL uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate its own synthetic Text-to-SQL examples. These examples are then rigorously filtered using a three-pronged relevance assessment based on semantic similarity, structural alignment, and reasoning path validity.  This filtering process ensures only high-quality examples are used in an in-context learning setting for final SQL query generation. Experiments on the Spider dataset show SAFE-SQL outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot methods, particularly on complex queries.  Ablation studies confirm the importance of each component of the SAFE-SQL framework.  The paper highlights the potential of self-augmentation for improving the robustness and accuracy of LLMs in data-scarce scenarios.  However, the reliance on a powerful LLM like GPT-4o presents a scalability limitation.

**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Text-to-SQL. The core idea of self-augmenting in-context learning with fine-grained example selection is novel and directly addresses a critical limitation of existing methods: the reliance on readily available similar training examples. The three-part relevance assessment is a sophisticated approach to filtering the noise inherent in LLM-generated data, resulting in a significant improvement in performance, especially for complex queries. The thorough experimental evaluation, including ablation studies, strengthens the claims made by the authors.  The detailed analysis of the impact of different weighting parameters on performance adds to the paper's value.

However, the reliance on a computationally expensive LLM like GPT-4o for both example generation and filtering limits the accessibility and scalability of the proposed method. While the authors acknowledge this limitation, a more detailed exploration of the trade-offs between LLM power and performance would strengthen the paper.  Furthermore, the generalization to truly unseen domains beyond those in Spider remains to be fully demonstrated.

Despite these weaknesses, the core contribution is significant and innovative. The proposed method opens up new possibilities for leveraging LLMs in data-scarce scenarios and for improving the robustness of Text-to-SQL systems.

### An Efficient Row-Based Sparse Fine-Tuning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11439v1)
- **Authors**: Cen-Jhih Li, Aditya Bhaskara
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning is an important step in adapting foundation models such as large language models to downstream tasks. To make this step more accessible to users with limited computational budgets, it is crucial to develop fine-tuning methods that are memory and computationally efficient. Sparse Fine-tuning (SFT) and Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) are two frameworks that have emerged for addressing this problem and have been adopted widely in practice. In this work, we develop a new SFT framework, based on ideas from neural network pruning. At a high level, we first identify "important" neurons/nodes using feature importance metrics from network pruning (specifically, we use the structural pruning method), and then perform fine-tuning by restricting to weights involving these neurons. Using experiments on common language tasks, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the memory efficiency of SFT without increasing training time complexity and implementation complexity, while achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods such as LoRA and its variants.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces SPruFT, a novel sparse fine-tuning framework for large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers.  SPruFT leverages neural network pruning techniques to identify important neurons, then fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons.  This approach aims to improve the memory efficiency of sparse fine-tuning (SFT) without increasing training time or implementation complexity.  The authors introduce two variants of Taylor importance â€“ class-aware and zeroth-order â€“ for different task types and demonstrate that SPruFT achieves memory efficiency comparable to or exceeding LoRA and its variants while maintaining competitive accuracy on several benchmark tasks.  They also analyze the memory consumption of various PEFT methods, arguing that computation graph complexity is a more significant factor than the number of trainable parameters.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, addressing a significant limitation of existing SFT methods: high memory consumption.  The core idea of using pruning techniques to guide sparse fine-tuning is innovative and well-motivated.  The empirical results demonstrating improved memory efficiency compared to LoRA and its variants are compelling.  The introduction of class-aware and zeroth-order Taylor importance metrics caters to different task settings and model scales, further enhancing the practical applicability of the proposed framework.  The analysis highlighting the importance of computation graph complexity in memory usage is insightful and contributes to a deeper understanding of PEFT.

However, some aspects warrant criticism.  The performance gains over other SFT methods and even LoRA, while present, aren't overwhelmingly substantial in many cases.  The reliance on existing pruning techniques means the effectiveness of SPruFT is intrinsically linked to the quality of the chosen importance metric; this dependency isn't fully explored. The theoretical analysis of the zeroth-order Taylor importance is limited.  While variance reduction strategies are discussed, a more thorough investigation into the statistical properties of the estimator and the choice of hyperparameters would strengthen the paper.  The lack of a comprehensive comparison with a broader range of SFT methods is also a limitation.


Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper's novelty and impact on the field are significant but not groundbreaking.  It offers a practical and effective solution to a key challenge in PEFT, but the performance improvements over state-of-the-art aren't transformative.

### Which Retain Set Matters for LLM Unlearning? A Case Study on Entity Unlearning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11441v1)
- **Authors**: Hwan Chang, Hwanhee Lee
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focus on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of large language model (LLM) unlearning on different subsets of the retained training data (retain set).  Focusing on entity unlearning, the authors introduce a new type of neighbor set â€“ the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set (Nsyntactically) â€“  comprising queries with similar syntactic structures to the data being removed.  Experiments show that Nsyntactically suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning, more so than domain or entity-based neighbor sets.  Furthermore, using Nsyntactically for regularization during unlearning not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also leads to comparable or better results across other data subsets.  The study concludes that syntactic similarity is a critical factor in effective LLM unlearning, more so than previously considered domain or entity relationships.

### Does RAG Really Perform Bad For Long-Context Processing?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11444v1)
- **Authors**: Kun Luo, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang, Hongjin Qian, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu
- **Abstract**: The efficient processing of long context poses a serious challenge for large language models (LLMs). Recently, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising strategy for this problem, as it enables LLMs to make selective use of the long context for efficient computation. However, existing RAG approaches lag behind other long-context processing methods due to inherent limitations on inaccurate retrieval and fragmented contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce RetroLM, a novel RAG framework for long-context processing. Unlike traditional methods, RetroLM employs KV-level retrieval augmentation, where it partitions the LLM's KV cache into contiguous pages and retrieves the most crucial ones for efficient computation. This approach enhances robustness to retrieval inaccuracy, facilitates effective utilization of fragmented contexts, and saves the cost from repeated computation. Building on this framework, we further develop a specialized retriever for precise retrieval of critical pages and conduct unsupervised post-training to optimize the model's ability to leverage retrieved information. We conduct comprehensive evaluations with a variety of benchmarks, including LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER, where RetroLM significantly outperforms existing long-context LLMs and efficient long-context processing methods, particularly in tasks requiring intensive reasoning or extremely long-context comprehension.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces RetroLM, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for efficient long-context processing in Large Language Models (LLMs).  Unlike traditional RAG, which retrieves and concatenates token-level fragments, RetroLM retrieves key-value (KV) cache *pages*. This approach addresses limitations of existing RAG methods, namely retrieval inaccuracy, fragmented contexts, and repeated computation.  RetroLM employs a specialized, trainable page retriever and unsupervised post-training to optimize performance.  Evaluations on LongBench, InfiniteBench, and RULER benchmarks demonstrate that RetroLM significantly outperforms existing efficient long-context methods, often matching or exceeding the performance of full-attention models, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks.  The paper also includes ablation studies showing the contributions of the page retriever and post-training.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of efficient long-context processing for LLMs.  The core idea of retrieving at the KV cache level is novel and addresses a crucial bottleneck in applying LLMs to very long inputs.  The proposed approach of using bookmark tokens to identify and retrieve relevant KV pages is elegant and avoids the problems of token-level retrieval. The empirical results are strong, demonstrating consistent improvements over various baselines across multiple benchmarks. The inclusion of ablation studies strengthens the argument for the individual contributions of the page retriever and post-training.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on contrastive learning for training the page retriever raises questions about scalability and data efficiency. While the paper addresses this by combining MS MARCO and SlimPajama data, a more thorough analysis of data requirements would be beneficial.  Further, the paper focuses heavily on quantitative results; a deeper qualitative analysis of the model's behavior and limitations would enhance the understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, the paper's claims of surpassing full-attention methods require careful scrutiny; more details on experimental setup and potential biases in the benchmarks are necessary.


Despite these weaknesses, the novelty of the KV-level retrieval approach, the strong empirical results, and the clear articulation of the problem and solution justify a high score.  The work has the potential to significantly influence future research on efficient long-context processing and the development of more efficient and powerful LLMs.

### Does Editing Provide Evidence for Localization?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11447v1)
- **Authors**: Zihao Wang, Victor Veitch
- **Abstract**: A basic aspiration for interpretability research in large language models is to "localize" semantically meaningful behaviors to particular components within the LLM. There are various heuristics for finding candidate locations within the LLM. Once a candidate localization is found, it can be assessed by editing the internal representations at the corresponding localization and checking whether this induces model behavior that is consistent with the semantic interpretation of the localization. The question we address here is: how strong is the evidence provided by such edits? To assess localization, we want to assess the effect of the optimal intervention at a particular location. The key new technical tool is a way of adapting LLM alignment techniques to find such optimal localized edits. With this tool in hand, we give an example where the edit-based evidence for localization appears strong, but where localization clearly fails. Indeed, we find that optimal edits at random localizations can be as effective as aligning the full model. In aggregate, our results suggest that merely observing that localized edits induce targeted changes in behavior provides little to no evidence that these locations actually encode the target behavior.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the reliability of using localized edits to internal representations of large language models (LLMs) as evidence for localization of specific semantic behaviors.  The authors challenge the common practice of assessing localization by observing whether edits to a heuristically-identified location in the model produce the expected behavioral change.  They introduce a method to find *optimal* localized edits by adapting LLM alignment techniques, specifically a rank-1 LoRA reparameterization for connecting weight updates to representation edits.  Using the TruthfulQA dataset and an Alpaca-7B model, they replicate the Inference-Time-Interference (ITI) setup, focusing on the localization of "truthfulness".  Surprisingly, they find that optimal edits applied to randomly selected locations are as effective at inducing truthful responses as optimal edits to the locations identified by ITI's probing method.  Even when restricting to single heads, multiple equally effective locations exist.  This suggests that successful localized edits provide weak evidence for the actual encoding of the target behavior at that location.  The paper concludes that edit-based evidence alone is insufficient for establishing localization and emphasizes the need for more rigorous methodologies and clearly defined objectives in interpretability research.  The novel technical contribution is the method for finding optimal localized edits, which may be of independent interest.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper's core contribution is the critical evaluation of a widely used method for assessing localization in LLMs.  The demonstration that optimal edits applied randomly can match the performance of edits applied to heuristically identified "meaningful" locations is a significant finding. This directly challenges a prevalent assumption in interpretability research, highlighting a fundamental flaw in a common methodology. The development of a method for finding optimal localized edits is a noteworthy technical advancement, enhancing the precision of such investigations.

However, the paper's scope is somewhat limited. The findings are demonstrated primarily within a single example (truthfulness in a specific LLM), although the authors argue for broader applicability.  The reliance on a specific alignment technique (IPO) might limit generalizability. While the reparameterized LoRA approach is novel, itâ€™s a modification of existing techniques, not a completely new architectural innovation.  Moreover, the paper doesn't directly propose a replacement methodology, leaving the reader with a critical analysis but no immediate solution.


**Strengths:**

* **Significant Negative Result:**  The core findingâ€”that successful localized edits are not strong evidence for localizationâ€”is a powerful contribution to the field, forcing a critical reassessment of common practices.
* **Methodological Advance:** The developed technique for finding optimal localized edits offers a significant improvement over previous heuristic methods.
* **Rigorous Empirical Evaluation:** The experiments are well-designed and clearly presented, supporting the core conclusions.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope:**  While the authors argue for broader implications, the empirical results are confined to one specific task and model.
* **Lack of Alternative Methodology:** The paper identifies a problem but doesn't offer a concrete solution beyond advocating for more rigorous methods.
* **Potential for Overinterpretation:**  While the findings are significant, there's a risk of overinterpreting them as a complete rejection of localization efforts.


Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper makes a significant contribution to the ongoing debate about interpretability in LLMs.  It raises important methodological concerns and offers a practical tool for future research. However, the limitations in scope and lack of a fully formed alternative methodology prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.

### AGrail: A Lifelong Agent Guardrail with Effective and Adaptive Safety Detection
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11448v1)
- **Authors**: Weidi Luo, Shenghong Dai, Xiaogeng Liu, Suman Banerjee, Huan Sun, Muhao Chen, Chaowei Xiao
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their deployment as autonomous agents for handling complex tasks in dynamic environments. These LLMs demonstrate strong problem-solving capabilities and adaptability to multifaceted scenarios. However, their use as agents also introduces significant risks, including task-specific risks, which are identified by the agent administrator based on the specific task requirements and constraints, and systemic risks, which stem from vulnerabilities in their design or interactions, potentially compromising confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) of information and triggering security risks. Existing defense agencies fail to adaptively and effectively mitigate these risks. In this paper, we propose AGrail, a lifelong agent guardrail to enhance LLM agent safety, which features adaptive safety check generation, effective safety check optimization, and tool compatibility and flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGrail not only achieves strong performance against task-specific and system risks but also exhibits transferability across different LLM agents' tasks.
- **Summary**: AGrail is a lifelong learning framework designed to enhance the safety of Large Language Model (LLM) agents.  It addresses the limitations of existing defense mechanisms by adaptively generating and optimizing safety checks for various tasks and environments.  AGrail uses two collaborative LLMs: an Analyzer that generates and refines safety checks based on universal and task-specific safety criteria, and an Executor that evaluates these checks, invoking external tools when necessary.  Extensive experiments on real-world datasets (Mind2Web-SC, EICU-AC, AdvWeb, EIA, and a newly introduced Safe-OS benchmark) demonstrate AGrail's strong performance in mitigating both task-specific and systemic risks, including prompt injection and environment-based attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on benign actions.  The framework incorporates a memory module for lifelong learning, showing good transferability across different tasks and agents.

**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

AGrail makes a valuable contribution to the burgeoning field of LLM agent safety. Its key strength lies in its adaptive and lifelong learning approach, addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on pre-defined rules or struggle with dynamic environments.  The creation of the Safe-OS benchmark is also a notable contribution, offering a more realistic evaluation setting than previous LLM-generated datasets. The use of collaborative LLMs for check generation and optimization is innovative and effectively addresses the challenge of creating both robust and minimally restrictive safety policies. The extensive experimental evaluation across multiple datasets further strengthens the paper's claims.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  While the combination of techniques is novel, the individual components (LLM-based safety checks, memory for learning, tool integration) are not entirely new.  Furthermore, the reliance on off-the-shelf LLMs, rather than training a specialized guardrail model, represents a limitation.  The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost of AGrail compared to other methods, which could be a significant barrier to adoption.

The potential influence on the field is high.  AGrail provides a practical framework that researchers can adapt and build upon.  The introduction of Safe-OS offers a valuable new benchmark for future research. The emphasis on real-world scenarios and adaptive learning should encourage the development of more robust and context-aware safety mechanisms.

Score: 8

**Rationale:**

The score reflects the paper's significant contributions to the field, particularly its adaptive approach and the new benchmark. However, the incremental nature of the novelty and the lack of deeper analysis in certain areas (e.g., computational cost, training a specialized guardrail) prevent it from achieving a higher score. The paper is well-written and the experiments are comprehensive, making it a valuable contribution overall.

### From Personas to Talks: Revisiting the Impact of Personas on LLM-Synthesized Emotional Support Conversations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11451v1)
- **Authors**: Shenghan Wu, Yang Deng, Yimo Zhu, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the generation of emotional support conversations (ESC), offering scalable solutions with reduced costs and enhanced data privacy. This paper explores the role of personas in the creation of ESC by LLMs. Our research utilizes established psychological frameworks to measure and infuse persona traits into LLMs, which then generate dialogues in the emotional support scenario. We conduct extensive evaluations to understand the stability of persona traits in dialogues, examining shifts in traits post-generation and their impact on dialogue quality and strategy distribution. Experimental results reveal several notable findings: 1) LLMs can infer core persona traits, 2) subtle shifts in emotionality and extraversion occur, influencing the dialogue dynamics, and 3) the application of persona traits modifies the distribution of emotional support strategies, enhancing the relevance and empathetic quality of the responses. These findings highlight the potential of persona-driven LLMs in crafting more personalized, empathetic, and effective emotional support dialogues, which has significant implications for the future design of AI-driven emotional support systems.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of personas on Large Language Model (LLM)-generated emotional support conversations (ESCs).  The authors infused persona traits (personality and communication style) from established psychological frameworks (HEXACO, CSI) into LLMs, then evaluated the resulting dialogues.  Key findings include: 1) LLMs can effectively infer persona traits from descriptions; 2) while LLM-generated dialogues largely maintain original persona traits, subtle shifts in emotionality and extraversion occur; and 3) incorporating personas alters the distribution of emotional support strategies, leading to more empathetic and relevant responses.  The study uses multiple LLMs and datasets for robust evaluation, including human evaluation comparing persona-driven and persona-less dialogues.  While showing promise for personalized AI emotional support, the authors acknowledge limitations regarding LLM biases and the omniscient information access in the simulated conversations.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of AI-driven emotional support, but its novelty and significance are not groundbreaking.

**Strengths:**

* **Systematic Approach:** The study employs a well-defined methodology, leveraging established psychological frameworks and multiple LLMs for a robust evaluation.  The use of multiple datasets strengthens the generalizability of the findings.
* **Human Evaluation:** Inclusion of human evaluation adds a crucial layer of validation beyond quantitative metrics, providing insights into the perceived quality and empathy of the generated dialogues.
* **Addressing a Relevant Problem:** The research tackles a crucial issue in AI-driven emotional support: personalization and empathy.  The findings could inform the design of more effective and human-like chatbots.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper explores the impact of personas on both the stability of traits during dialogue generation and the distribution of emotional support strategies.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental Novelty:** While the study is well-executed, the core idea of integrating personas into LLM-generated conversations is not entirely novel.  Similar work has been done, although perhaps not with the same level of rigorous psychological measurement.
* **Simplistic Persona Representation:** The reliance on simplified persona descriptions might not fully capture the complexity of human personality.  More nuanced persona representation could yield more insightful results.
* **Omniscient Setting:** The simulated conversations operate under an omniscient setting, where both the seeker and supporter have complete access to information. This deviates from real-world conversational dynamics, limiting the ecological validity of the findings.
* **Limited Generalizability (Ethical Considerations):** The ethical considerations section highlights that the work should be considered only for academic purposes.  This is a major limitation when assessing real-world impact.


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's findings are likely to influence the development of AI emotional support systems by emphasizing the importance of considering individual differences and utilizing psychological frameworks for more personalized and effective interactions.  However, the limited generalizability due to the simulated setting and ethical concerns might restrict its immediate practical application.


**Score: 7**

The paper is well-executed and contributes valuable insights into the role of personas in LLM-generated ESCs. However, its incremental novelty and limitations regarding the simulated setting and real-world applicability prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The study provides a solid foundation for future research, but further work is needed to address the limitations and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of persona-driven AI emotional support in real-world settings.

- **Authors**: Xun Zhu, Zheng Zhang, Xi Chen, Yiming Shi, Miao Li, Ji Wu
- **Abstract**: With the rapid advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), connectors play a pivotal role in bridging diverse modalities and enhancing model performance. However, the design and evolution of connectors have not been comprehensively analyzed, leaving gaps in understanding how these components function and hindering the development of more powerful connectors. In this survey, we systematically review the current progress of connectors in MLLMs and present a structured taxonomy that categorizes connectors into atomic operations (mapping, compression, mixture of experts) and holistic designs (multi-layer, multi-encoder, multi-modal scenarios), highlighting their technical contributions and advancements. Furthermore, we discuss several promising research frontiers and challenges, including high-resolution input, dynamic compression, guide information selection, combination strategy, and interpretability. This survey is intended to serve as a foundational reference and a clear roadmap for researchers, providing valuable insights into the design and optimization of next-generation connectors to enhance the performance and adaptability of MLLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper, "Connector-S: A Survey of Connectors in Multi-modal Large Language Models," provides a comprehensive review of the different approaches used to connect modalities (like images or audio) with language models in multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs).  The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing connectors into atomic operations (mapping, compression, mixture of experts) and holistic designs (multi-layer, multi-encoder, multi-modal scenarios). They survey existing MLLMs, classifying their connectors according to this taxonomy and highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, they identify several promising research frontiers, including high-resolution input handling, dynamic compression, improved guide information selection, more efficient combination strategies, and enhanced interpretability.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper's strength lies in its thoroughness. It offers a well-structured taxonomy and a comprehensive survey of existing methods, compiling a significant amount of information in one place.  The categorization of connectors helps to clarify the design space and identify areas for future work. The discussion of future research directions is insightful and points towards important challenges in the field. The inclusion of a detailed figure and tables summarizing the different approaches is very helpful.

However, the paper's novelty is limited.  While the survey is comprehensive, it primarily synthesizes existing work rather than presenting novel contributions of its own. The proposed taxonomy, while useful, isn't fundamentally groundbreaking; it's a logical structuring of existing techniques.  The paper doesn't propose a new connector architecture or a novel methodology for evaluating connectors.  It mostly relies on summarizing the findings of other papers. The critical evaluation of the different approaches is somewhat lacking, presenting each method more descriptively than analytically.  More comparative analysis and a deeper dive into the limitations of each approach would significantly strengthen the paper.

The paper's potential influence on the field is primarily as a useful resource for researchers entering the area. It acts as a good starting point for understanding the current state-of-the-art in MLLM connectors. However, its lack of original contributions limits its impact on significantly advancing the field itself.


Score: 7

**Rationale:**  The paper achieves a solid 7 due to its comprehensiveness and helpful organization of the existing literature. The structured taxonomy and the detailed survey are valuable contributions to the field.  However, the lack of significant novelty in methodology or results prevents it from scoring higher. A more critical and comparative analysis of the surveyed methods, along with a stronger emphasis on the limitations and open problems, would elevate the paper's impact and justification for a higher score.

### UniCBE: An Uniformity-driven Comparing Based Evaluation Framework with Unified Multi-Objective Optimization

- **Authors**: Peiwen Yuan, Shaoxiong Feng, Yiwei Li, Xinglin Wang, Yueqi Zhang, Jiayi Shi, Chuyi Tan, Boyuan Pan, Yao Hu, Kan Li
- **Abstract**: Human preference plays a significant role in measuring large language models and guiding them to align with human values. Unfortunately, current comparing-based evaluation (CBE) methods typically focus on a single optimization objective, failing to effectively utilize scarce yet valuable preference signals. To address this, we delve into key factors that can enhance the accuracy, convergence, and scalability of CBE: suppressing sampling bias, balancing descending process of uncertainty, and mitigating updating uncertainty. Following the derived guidelines, we propose UniCBE, a unified uniformity-driven CBE framework which simultaneously optimize these core objectives by constructing and integrating three decoupled sampling probability matrices, each designed to ensure uniformity in specific aspects. We further ablate the optimal tuple sampling and preference aggregation strategies to achieve efficient CBE. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, UniCBE saves over 17% of evaluation budgets while achieving a Pearson correlation with ground truth exceeding 0.995, demonstrating excellent accuracy and convergence. In scenarios where new models are continuously introduced, UniCBE can even save over 50% of evaluation costs, highlighting its improved scalability.
- **Summary**: UNICBE is a novel comparing-based evaluation (CBE) framework for large language models (LLMs).  Existing CBE methods typically optimize a single objective (accuracy, convergence, or scalability), leading to suboptimal performance.  UNICBE addresses this by simultaneously optimizing all three objectives through a unified multi-objective optimization strategy.  This is achieved by constructing three decoupled sampling probability matricesâ€”one for each objectiveâ€”and integrating them to guide the selection of model-sample pairs for comparison.  The framework also explores different tuple sampling and preference aggregation strategies.  Experiments on the AlpacaEval benchmark show UNICBE achieving a Pearson correlation with ground truth exceeding 0.995 while saving over 17% of the evaluation budget compared to random sampling.  In dynamic scenarios with continuously added models, UNICBE saves over 50% of evaluation costs.  The paper provides theoretical analysis supporting the design choices and conducts extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of different components.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation.  The core idea of unifying the optimization of accuracy, convergence, and scalability in CBE is novel and addresses a significant limitation of existing methods. The theoretical analysis and the multi-objective optimization strategy are well-justified and provide a strong foundation for the proposed method. The extensive experimental results, including ablation studies and tests under various settings (different judges, dynamic model additions, list-wise preferences), demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of UNICBE. The clear visualization of results and detailed explanation of the methodology enhance the paper's clarity and reproducibility.


However, some aspects could be strengthened.  While the paper claims to address sampling bias, the analysis focuses primarily on the bias introduced by incomplete sampling, rather than potentially more fundamental biases inherent in the human preference data itself.  A more in-depth discussion of how UNICBE addresses or is affected by these underlying biases would be beneficial. The impact of the hyperparameter Î± could be explored more comprehensively.  The paper mentions experimenting with different ranges of Î±, but the final selection of Î± = 2 lacks in-depth justification.  Further clarification on the computational cost of UNICBE compared to other methods would also be valuable.


Despite these minor weaknesses, the overall contribution of the paper is significant.  The proposed framework offers a practical and efficient solution for evaluating LLMs, particularly in dynamic environments with a continuous influx of new models.  The clarity of presentation and the thoroughness of the experimental validation significantly enhance its impact.

### Adversary-Aware DPO: Enhancing Safety Alignment in Vision Language Models via Adversarial Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11455v1)
- **Authors**: Fenghua Weng, Jian Lou, Jun Feng, Minlie Huang, Wenjie Wang
- **Abstract**: Safety alignment is critical in pre-training large language models (LLMs) to generate responses aligned with human values and refuse harmful queries. Unlike LLM, the current safety alignment of VLMs is often achieved with post-hoc safety fine-tuning. However, these methods are less effective to white-box attacks. To address this, we propose $\textit{Adversary-aware DPO (ADPO)}$, a novel training framework that explicitly considers adversarial. $\textit{Adversary-aware DPO (ADPO)}$ integrates adversarial training into DPO to enhance the safety alignment of VLMs under worst-case adversarial perturbations. $\textit{ADPO}$ introduces two key components: (1) an adversarial-trained reference model that generates human-preferred responses under worst-case perturbations, and (2) an adversarial-aware DPO loss that generates winner-loser pairs accounting for adversarial distortions. By combining these innovations, $\textit{ADPO}$ ensures that VLMs remain robust and reliable even in the presence of sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textit{ADPO}$ outperforms baselines in the safety alignment and general utility of VLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes Adversary-Aware DPO (ADPO), a novel training framework to improve the safety alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) against adversarial attacks (jailbreaks).  Existing post-hoc safety fine-tuning methods for VLMs are ineffective against sophisticated white-box attacks. ADPO addresses this by integrating adversarial training into Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).  It uses two key components: (1) an adversarially trained reference model that generates preferred responses even under adversarial perturbations, and (2) an adversarial-aware DPO loss that considers worst-case perturbations during training. Experiments on LLaVA models show ADPO significantly reduces the attack success rate across various jailbreaks while maintaining reasonable utility on standard tasks.  The paper includes ablation studies and latent space visualization to support its claims.  However, it acknowledges a trade-off between safety and utility and limits its scope to DPO, leaving other alignment methods for future work.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the growing field of VLM safety. The integration of adversarial training within the DPO framework is a novel approach, directly addressing the vulnerability of existing safety methods to adversarial attacks. The experimental evaluation is relatively comprehensive, testing against multiple attack types and utility benchmarks. The visualization of latent space changes provides further insight into the mechanism of ADPO.

However, several weaknesses limit the overall impact:

* **Limited Scope:**  Restricting the adversarial training to only the DPO framework is a significant limitation.  The paper acknowledges this, but a broader exploration of applying the core ideas to other safety alignment techniques (like RLHF) would significantly enhance its impact.
* **Trade-off between Safety and Utility:** The paper clearly demonstrates the inherent trade-off between improved safety robustness and potential reduction in utility.  While this is acknowledged, the paper doesn't delve deep into strategies to mitigate this trade-off.  Further investigation into this aspect would strengthen the contribution.
* **Dependence on Specific Attack Methods:** While multiple attacks are used, relying primarily on PGD for generating adversarial perturbations limits the generalizability of the findings. Exploring other attack methods would strengthen the claim of robustness.
* **Lack of a Clear Theoretical Analysis:** While empirically sound, a deeper theoretical analysis of the proposed framework would enhance the paper's contribution.


Despite these weaknesses, the core idea of incorporating adversarial training into VLM safety alignment is novel and impactful.  The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing approaches. The paper's potential influence on the field is high, as it directly addresses a critical and timely problem.

### Towards Efficient Pre-training: Exploring FP4 Precision in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11458v1)
- **Authors**: Jiecheng Zhou, Ding Tang, Rong Fu, Boni Hu, Haoran Xu, Yi Wang, Zhilin Pei, Zhongling Su, Liang Liu, Xingcheng Zhang, Weiming Zhang
- **Abstract**: The burgeoning computational demands for training large language models (LLMs) necessitate efficient methods, including quantized training, which leverages low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce costs. While FP8 precision has shown potential, leveraging FP4 remains challenging due to inherent quantization errors and limited representation capability. Based on the Transformer architecture, we present an FP4 training scheme for LLMs, overcoming these obstacles through mixed-precision quantization strategies tailed for different modules and training stages. This allows us to apply the precision level suitable to distinct components within the model, ensuring that multi-head attention and linear layers are handled appropriately. Our pretraining recipe ensures stability in backpropagation by incorporating fine-grained quantization methods with a target precision training schedule. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 training scheme achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with smaller theoretical computational cost. With the advent of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our method sets the foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.
- **Summary**: This paper explores the use of FP4 precision for pre-training large language models (LLMs), a significantly more challenging task than using higher precision formats like FP8 or BF16 due to increased quantization errors.  The authors propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy tailored to different Transformer modules and training stages.  Specifically, they use FP8 for the multi-head attention mechanism (critical for LLM performance) and for weight gradient computation during backpropagation (due to its sensitivity to precision loss).  Forward computation in other linear layers uses FP4, employing a per-block quantization strategy.  A two-stage training schedule, finishing with a short period of FP16 training, further mitigates quantization noise. Experiments on GPT-2 and LLaMA models show comparable accuracy to FP16 training with a claimed 30% reduction in computational cost.  Ablation studies highlight the effectiveness of their mixed-precision approach.  The limitations acknowledged include the lack of testing on extremely large models and datasets, the use of simulated FP4, and the relatively simple strategy for handling sensitive components.


**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of efficient LLM training.  Using FP4 is a significant step towards even greater computational savings compared to FP8. The mixed-precision strategy, tailored to the specific sensitivities of different model components and training phases, is a key strength. The inclusion of a two-stage training schedule to refine the model after FP4 training further enhances the approach.  The experimental results demonstrating comparable accuracy to FP16 are encouraging.

However, several weaknesses limit the impact.  The reliance on simulated FP4 weakens the claim of a 30% computational cost reduction; real-world hardware implementation and benchmarking are crucial. The ablation study, while informative, could be more comprehensive.  Furthermore, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art low-precision training methods, making it difficult to definitively assess its superiority.  The discussion of the limitations is relatively brief, and a more thorough exploration of potential avenues for improvement would strengthen the paper.


The novelty lies primarily in applying FP4 to LLM pre-training and the development of the sophisticated mixed-precision strategy. While low-precision training is an active research area, pushing the boundaries to FP4 with a carefully designed approach represents a significant advance.  The potential impact is high if the results translate seamlessly to real-world FP4 hardware.  However, the limitations currently prevent a higher score.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet code generation remains a major challenge. Current approaches for obtaining high-quality code data primarily focus on (i) collecting large-scale pre-training data and (ii) synthesizing instruction data through prompt engineering with powerful models. While pre-training data faces quality consistency issues, instruction-based synthesis suffers from limited instruction diversity and inherent biases of LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce UnitCoder, a systematic pipeline leveraging model-generated unit tests to both guide and validate the code generation process. Combined with large-scale package-based retrieval from pre-training corpus, we generate a dataset of 500K+ verifiable programs containing diverse API calls. Evaluations on multiple Python benchmarks (BigCodeBench, HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that models fine-tuned on our synthetic data exhibit consistent performance improvements. Notably, Llama3.1-8B and InternLM2.5-7B improve from 31\% and 28\% to 40\% and 39\% success rates on BigCodeBench, respectively. Our work presents a scalable approach that leverages model-generated unit tests to guide the synthesis of high-quality code data from pre-training corpora, demonstrating the potential for producing diverse and high-quality post-training data at scale. All code and data will be released (https://github.com).
- **Summary**: UnitCoder is a scalable pipeline for synthesizing high-quality code training data.  It addresses limitations of existing methods (large-scale pre-training with inconsistent quality and instruction-based synthesis with limited diversity) by using model-generated unit tests to guide and validate code generation from a pre-training corpus.  The pipeline consists of three stages: (1) Data Preparation â€“ extracting functions and generating unit tests; (2) Fix and Refine Flow â€“ iteratively debugging and refining code based on test results; (3) Post-Train â€“ creating a dataset for fine-tuning LLMs. Experiments on multiple Python benchmarks (BigCodeBench, HumanEval, MBPP) show significant performance improvements in LLMs fine-tuned on the UnitCoder-generated dataset (e.g., Llama3.1-8B and InternLM2.5-7B success rates on BigCodeBench increased from 31% and 28% to 40% and 39%, respectively).  Ablation studies confirm the importance of each pipeline component. The generated dataset contains over 500K verifiable programs.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

UnitCoder presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM-based code generation by focusing on the crucial issue of data quality.  The iterative refinement guided by unit tests is a novel approach that addresses the inherent biases and inconsistencies in existing large-scale code datasets and instruction-following techniques. The demonstrable performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, particularly on tasks involving complex API interactions, are strong evidence of the method's effectiveness.  The ablation studies provide further confidence in the design choices.  The release of the code and data is also a significant contribution to the community.


However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  The individual components (LLM-based code generation, unit test generation, iterative debugging) are not entirely novel.  The key contribution lies in their systematic integration and application to a large-scale code synthesis task. The focus on Python also limits the generalizability claims.  Furthermore, a more thorough discussion of the computational cost of the pipeline would strengthen the analysis of scalability.


Considering these aspects, UnitCoder offers a significant advancement in generating high-quality code data, but its novelty is not groundbreaking.  The substantial empirical evidence and the practical impact on LLM performance justifies a high score, but the incremental nature of the approach prevents a perfect score.

### GiFT: Gibbs Fine-Tuning for Code Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11466v1)
- **Authors**: Haochen Li, Wanjin Feng, Xin Zhou, Zhiqi Shen
- **Abstract**: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data is a prevalent practice in code generation. A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks.
- **Summary**: GiFT (Gibbs Fine-Tuning) is a novel self-training method for code generation LLMs.  Existing self-training approaches typically fine-tune models on code generated conditionally, given a specific description.  GiFT addresses the bias inherent in this approach by using Gibbs sampling to iteratively generate code and descriptions, approximating the marginal distribution of code in the joint description-code space.  This aims to generate more diverse and representative training data.  Furthermore, GiFT employs perplexity-based code selection to mitigate the long-tail distribution of self-generated code, favoring less frequent (and potentially more informative) examples. Experiments on two LLMs and four datasets demonstrate GiFT's superiority over baseline methods, especially on more challenging benchmarks.  The paper also explores the integration of self-generated descriptions and the application of GiFT to knowledge distillation.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The use of Gibbs sampling to approximate the marginal distribution of code is a novel contribution to the self-training paradigm for code generation. This addresses a significant limitation of conditional sampling methods.
* **Theoretical Justification:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis supporting the benefits of using the marginal distribution, linking it to reduced bias and increased diversity in training data.
* **Comprehensive Experiments:** The evaluation is conducted on multiple LLMs, datasets, and with variations in hyperparameters, providing a robust assessment of GiFT's effectiveness.
* **Addressing Data Imbalance:**  The perplexity-based code selection strategy directly tackles the known issue of long-tail distributions in generated code, a crucial aspect often overlooked.
* **Exploration of Related Techniques:** The authors explore the combination of GiFT with other approaches (incorporation of rewritten descriptions and distillation) further expanding its potential applications.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Cost:** The iterative Gibbs sampling process introduces a significant computational overhead, which might limit its scalability for extremely large models or datasets. The paper does not thoroughly discuss this practical limitation.
* **Dependence on LLM Capabilities:** The effectiveness of GiFT hinges on the LLM's ability to accurately translate between code and natural language descriptions.  If the LLM's translation quality is poor, the benefits of GiFT might be diminished or even reversed.  The analysis of this dependency is relatively brief.
* **Limited Generalizability:** While the authors discuss the applicability of GiFT to other tasks, a more thorough investigation into its limitations and the conditions under which it is most effective would strengthen the paper.  The discussion on generalizability is more of an acknowledgement than a deep dive.
* **Incorporation of Self-Generated Descriptions:** The results of incorporating self-generated descriptions were mixed and not conclusively positive, suggesting that this aspect requires further investigation and refinement.


**Significance and Potential Influence:**

GiFT offers a valuable contribution to the field by providing a novel and theoretically grounded method to improve the quality of synthetic data for LLM fine-tuning in code generation.  The approach addresses a core limitation of existing self-training techniques.  However, the practical considerations of computational cost and the LLM's translation capabilities need further attention.  The impact of GiFT will depend on its scalability and adaptability to different models and tasks. While promising, further research is needed to fully realize its potential.


Score: 7

**Rationale:** The paper presents a novel and promising approach with solid theoretical backing and comprehensive experimental evaluation.  However, the limitations regarding computational cost and the dependence on LLM capabilities need to be more explicitly addressed and mitigated.  The mixed results with self-generated descriptions also indicate areas for future work.  Therefore, while a significant contribution, it falls short of a truly exceptional breakthrough, warranting a score of 7.

### Approximation of Permutation Invariant Polynomials by Transformers: Efficient Construction in Column-Size
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11467v1)
- **Authors**: Naoki Takeshita, Masaaki Imaizumi
- **Abstract**: Transformers are a type of neural network that have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, particularly in natural language processing tasks. Motivated by this success, research on the theoretical understanding of transformers has garnered significant attention. A notable example is the mathematical analysis of their approximation power, which validates the empirical expressive capability of transformers. In this study, we investigate the ability of transformers to approximate column-symmetric polynomials, an extension of symmetric polynomials that take matrices as input. Consequently, we establish an explicit relationship between the size of the transformer network and its approximation capability, leveraging the parameter efficiency of transformers and their compatibility with symmetry by focusing on the algebraic properties of symmetric polynomials.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the ability of transformer networks to approximate column-symmetric polynomials â€“ a generalization of symmetric polynomials to matrices.  The authors prove that a transformer with a single attention head can approximate these polynomials with an error that decreases exponentially with depth and is independent of the number of columns in the input matrix. This is achieved by constructing the approximation through an inductive process, leveraging the algebraic properties of monomial column-symmetric polynomials. The key contribution is demonstrating parameter efficiency: the number of parameters in the approximating transformer remains independent of the number of input columns, unlike traditional neural networks.  The proof is constructive, providing explicit parameter configurations for the transformer.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the theoretical understanding of transformers' approximation capabilities.  The focus on parameter efficiency in approximating column-symmetric polynomials is a significant step forward, particularly considering the increasing size of modern transformer models. The constructive proof adds to the paper's strength, providing a more tangible understanding than mere existence proofs. The authors also thoroughly review relevant literature on universal approximation, highlighting the novelty of their approach in comparison to existing methods for approximating symmetric functions.


However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall impact:

* **Limited Practical Applicability:** While theoretically interesting, the exponential dependence of the transformer's width on the input dimension (d) and the degree of the polynomial (s) significantly restricts the practical applicability of the result.  For large d or s, the width becomes computationally infeasible.
* **Restrictive Assumptions:** The assumption of positive coefficients in the column-symmetric polynomial simplifies the analysis but reduces the generality of the result. Real-world functions are unlikely to always have this property.
* **Omission of Layer Normalization:** The simplification of omitting layer normalization, a crucial component of standard transformer architectures, raises concerns about the direct applicability of the findings to actual transformer implementations.
* **Focus on a Specific Class of Functions:**  The focus on column-symmetric polynomials, while an important class of functions, is a narrow subset of the functions transformers are used to approximate in practice. The extent to which these findings generalize to other types of functions remains unclear.


Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper presents a solid theoretical contribution but falls short of being groundbreaking due to its limitations. The parameter efficiency result is noteworthy, but the practical constraints significantly limit its impact. The work provides a useful building block for future research, but more work is needed to address the limitations outlined above to achieve wider applicability.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11471v1)
- **Authors**: Kangyang Luo, Yuzhuo Bai, Cheng Gao, Shuzheng Si, Yingli Shen, Zhu Liu, Zhitong Wang, Cunliang Kong, Wenhao Li, Yufei Huang, Ye Tian, Xuantang Xiong, Lei Han, Maosong Sun
- **Abstract**: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing or incomplete facts, is a crucial task for KGs. However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.
- **Summary**: GLTW is a novel method for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) that combines an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) with a Large Language Model (LLM).  iGT efficiently encodes subgraphs, considering both local and global structural information, and leverages a three-word language representation of entities and relations.  A subgraph-based multi-classification objective function further enhances training efficiency. The LLM is integrated to leverage its rich knowledge, resulting in deterministic predictions.  Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.  Ablation studies highlight the contributions of individual components, particularly iGT and the LLM integration.  However, the reliance on separate vocabularies for iGT and the LLM, and the information loss from pooling operations, are limitations.

**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of KGC by effectively integrating LLMs and graph neural network techniques.  The use of a three-word language and the improved Graph Transformer are noteworthy. The subgraph-based multi-classification approach is also a smart adaptation to the task.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate performance improvements. However, the incremental nature of the improvements (though statistically significant) and the reliance on existing techniques (LLMs, Graph Transformers) slightly detract from the overall novelty.  The identified limitations (separate vocabularies, pooling information loss) also indicate room for further development.

The paper's significance lies in its practical impact on improving KGC accuracy.  The proposed approach might be easily adopted by researchers and practitioners in the field. However, the long-term impact might be limited if the fundamental limitations are not addressed.  While the contributions are substantial, they are not revolutionary.

**Score: 7**

**Rationale:**

The score of 7 reflects the paper's strong contribution to the field of KGC. The proposed GLTW method achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating a clear improvement in performance. The novel aspects, such as the improved Graph Transformer and the integration strategy with LLMs, are significant. However, the incremental nature of the improvements, the reliance on existing techniques, and the acknowledged limitations prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The paper is well-written and provides a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method, including ablation studies. The potential influence on the field is notable, but the long-term impact depends on addressing the identified limitations.

### FastMCTS: A Simple Sampling Strategy for Data Synthesis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11476v1)
- **Authors**: Peiji Li, Kai Lv, Yunfan Shao, Yichuan Ma, Linyang Li, Xiaoqing Zheng, Xipeng Qiu, Qipeng Guo
- **Abstract**: Synthetic high-quality multi-step reasoning data can significantly enhance the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30\% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data by 3.9\% across multiple benchmarks. As a lightweight sampling strategy, FastMCTS offers a practical and efficient alternative for synthesizing high-quality reasoning data. Our code will be released soon.
- **Summary**: FastMCTS is a novel data synthesis strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).  Current methods, primarily rejection sampling, are inefficient and produce imbalanced datasets. FastMCTS, inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), addresses these limitations by offering a more efficient sampling method.  It incorporates an adaptive stay policy and dynamic exploration mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, adapting to problem complexity.  Crucially, FastMCTS preserves all generated reasoning trajectories during simulation, unlike traditional MCTS, significantly boosting efficiency. Experiments on English and Chinese reasoning datasets show FastMCTS generates substantially more correct reasoning paths and effective tokens than rejection sampling. Models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data across multiple benchmarks.  Further analysis demonstrates FastMCTS's ability to create balanced datasets across varying difficulty levels and its compatibility with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for further performance gains.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

FastMCTS presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM training data synthesis, addressing a significant bottleneck in improving LLM reasoning abilities.  The proposed Adaptive Stay Policy and Dynamic Exploration within the MCTS framework are intelligent modifications tailored to the specific challenges of LLM reasoning.  The "Reserve Simulation" strategy is particularly insightful, effectively leveraging the computational cost of LLM generation.  The empirical results, demonstrating significant improvements in both data generation efficiency and downstream model performance, are compelling.  The inclusion of DPO further strengthens the paper's impact, showing how FastMCTS's structured data can be leveraged for additional performance boosts.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct for both generation and verification, while understandable due to open-source accessibility, limits the generalizability of the findings. A comparison against stronger, closed-source models would strengthen the claims.  The ablation study, while useful, could be more comprehensive, exploring variations in hyperparameters and the impact of different components in more detail.  The discussion of potential limitations regarding prefix repetition in the tree structure is acknowledged but lacks a concrete plan for addressing it.


Considering the significant improvements in data synthesis efficiency and model performance, the innovative modifications to MCTS, and the effective integration with DPO, the paper makes a substantial contribution.  However, the limitations regarding the model choice and the relatively limited ablation study prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

### Learning to Sample Effective and Diverse Prompts for Text-to-Image Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11477v1)
- **Authors**: Taeyoung Yun, Dinghuai Zhang, Jinkyoo Park, Ling Pan
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation capabilities. However, it remains challenging to control the generation process with desired properties (e.g., aesthetic quality, user intention), which can be expressed as black-box reward functions. In this paper, we focus on prompt adaptation, which refines the original prompt into model-preferred prompts to generate desired images. While prior work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize prompts, we observe that applying RL often results in generating similar postfixes and deterministic behaviors. To this end, we introduce \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{A}daptation with \textbf{G}FlowNets (\textbf{PAG}), a novel approach that frames prompt adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem. Our key insight is that leveraging Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) allows us to shift from reward maximization to sampling from an unnormalized density function, enabling both high-quality and diverse prompt generation. However, we identify that a naive application of GFlowNets suffers from mode collapse and uncovers a previously overlooked phenomenon: the progressive loss of neural plasticity in the model, which is compounded by inefficient credit assignment in sequential prompt generation. To address this critical challenge, we develop a systematic approach in PAG with flow reactivation, reward-prioritized sampling, and reward decomposition for prompt adaptation. Extensive experiments validate that PAG successfully learns to sample effective and diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. We also show that PAG exhibits strong robustness across various reward functions and transferability to different text-to-image models.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Prompt Adaptation with GFlowNets (PAG), a novel method for improving text-to-image generation by adapting prompts instead of directly fine-tuning the image generation model.  Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from mode collapse, generating similar prompts and limiting diversity.  PAG frames prompt adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem, using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample prompts proportionally to their reward.  However, a naive application of GFlowNets also suffers from mode collapse due to a previously unobserved phenomenon: the progressive loss of neural plasticity in the language model.

To address this, PAG incorporates three key components: flow reactivation (periodically resetting the final layer of the flow network), reward-prioritized sampling (prioritizing high-reward samples during training), and reward decomposition (providing finer-grained reward signals at intermediate steps).  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAG generates both effective and diverse prompts, outperforming baselines across various reward functions and transferring well to different text-to-image models.  The authors also compare their approach to methods that directly fine-tune diffusion models, showing competitive results while offering the advantage of zero-shot transferability.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of text-to-image generation.  The identification of the "progressive loss of neural plasticity" in GFlowNet fine-tuning is a significant finding, offering a novel perspective on a common problem in deep learning. The proposed solution, incorporating flow reactivation, reward-prioritized sampling, and reward decomposition, is well-motivated and systematically addresses the identified limitations. The extensive experiments, including comparisons to strong baselines and across different models and reward functions, provide strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of PAG.  The zero-shot transferability is a particularly attractive feature, making the approach more broadly applicable.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on a pre-trained language model might limit the ultimate quality of generated prompts, and the complexity of the proposed method could be a barrier to adoption.  While the comparison to direct model fine-tuning is insightful, a more comprehensive comparison across a wider range of fine-tuning methods would strengthen the conclusions.  The paper's length and the inclusion of extensive appendices suggest some material could be more concisely presented.

Despite these minor weaknesses, the paper's novelty in identifying and addressing the plasticity loss problem, coupled with its strong empirical results and practical advantages, makes it a significant contribution.

### DATA: Decomposed Attention-based Task Adaptation for Rehearsal-Free Continual Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11482v1)
- **Authors**: Huanxuan Liao, Shizhu He, Yupu Hao, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu
- **Abstract**: Continual learning (CL) is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving real-world demands, yet they are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting (CF). While traditional CF solutions rely on expensive data rehearsal, recent rehearsal-free methods employ model-based and regularization-based strategies to address this issue. However, these approaches often neglect the model's plasticity, which is crucial to achieving optimal performance on newly learned tasks. Consequently, a key challenge in CL is striking a balance between preserving plasticity and mitigating CF. To tackle this challenge, we propose the $\textbf{D}$ecomposed $\textbf{A}$ttention-based $\textbf{T}$ask $\textbf{A}$daptation (DATA), which explicitly decouples and learns both task-specific and task-shared knowledge using high-rank and low-rank task adapters (e.g., LoRAs). For new tasks, DATA dynamically adjusts the weights of adapters of different ranks based on their relevance and distinction from previous tasks, allowing the model to acquire new task-specific skills while effectively retaining previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we implement a decomposed component weighting strategy comprising learnable components that collectively generate attention-based weights, allowing the model to integrate and utilize diverse knowledge from each DATA. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach significantly enhances model plasticity and mitigates CF by extending learnable components and employing stochastic restoration during training iterations.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces DATA (Decomposed Attention-based Task Adaptation), a rehearsal-free continual learning method for Large Language Models (LLMs).  DATA addresses catastrophic forgetting by employing high-rank and low-rank adapters to learn task-specific and task-shared knowledge, respectively.  A decomposed component weighting strategy dynamically adjusts adapter weights based on task relevance, further mitigating forgetting.  Stochastic restoration helps maintain plasticity. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, particularly in reducing forgetting while preserving the ability to learn new tasks.  Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.  However, the paper acknowledges limitations in computational cost and potential challenges with limited or low-quality task data.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a crucial problem:** Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for LLMs is a significant challenge.  The paper directly tackles this issue.
* **Novel approach:** The combination of high-rank/low-rank adapters with a decomposed attention-based weighting mechanism is a novel contribution.  The stochastic restoration strategy also adds to the originality.
* **Empirical validation:**  Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLMs provide strong empirical support for the proposed method.
* **Clear methodology:** The paper presents a well-defined methodology with clear explanations of the different components.
* **Open-source code:** The availability of code is a significant strength, facilitating reproducibility and further research.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational cost:** The introduction of additional adapters and the decomposed weighting mechanism likely increase computational cost, a significant limitation, especially for larger LLMs. The paper acknowledges this but doesn't fully quantify the overhead.
* **Data dependency:** While rehearsal-free, the method's performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of task-specific data.  The paper acknowledges this but doesn't explore scenarios with limited data.
* **Limited theoretical analysis:**  The paper focuses heavily on empirical results.  A more thorough theoretical analysis of why the proposed method works could strengthen the contribution.
* **Overly optimistic claims:** While the results show improvement, the claims of "significantly enhancing model plasticity" and achieving "state-of-the-art performance" need more nuanced discussion, particularly in comparison to very closely related techniques.

**Significance and Potential Influence:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of continual learning for LLMs.  The proposed method offers a novel approach to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while maintaining plasticity.  The empirical results are compelling, and the availability of code will enable other researchers to build upon this work.  However, the computational cost is a significant constraint that needs to be addressed in future work.  The lack of deeper theoretical understanding limits the generalizability of the findings.

**Score: 7**

The score reflects the paper's significant contribution to tackling a critical problem in a timely manner and providing a strong empirical validation of a novel approach.  However, the computational cost, lack of thorough theoretical analysis, and some potentially overly-optimistic claims prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The paper's impact will depend on future work addressing these limitations and demonstrating scalability to larger models and more challenging scenarios.

### Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking Makes Large Language Models Stronger on Knowledge Graph Question Answering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11491v1)
- **Authors**: Runxuan Liu, Bei Luo, Jiaqi Li, Baoxin Wang, Ming Liu, Dayong Wu, Shijin Wang, Bing Qin
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly enhances the capability of LLMs for KGQA.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs).  Existing KGQA methods struggle with multi-hop reasoning, often relying on entity vector matching that fails to capture the abstract purpose of a question. ORT addresses this by employing a three-phase approach: 1) using an LLM to extract the question's purpose and conditions, 2) constructing reasoning paths from the purpose back to the conditions using the knowledge graph's ontology, and 3) using these paths to guide knowledge retrieval and LLM-based answer generation.  Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both Hit@1 and F1 scores compared to various baselines, including other LLM-based methods.  Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component of the ORT framework.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of KGQA, particularly in addressing the limitations of existing LLM-based approaches. The core idea of "reverse thinking," starting the reasoning process from the question's goal rather than its explicit entities, is conceptually novel and intuitively appealing.  The integration of ontology-guided path construction and LLM-based filtering further enhances the method's robustness. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of ORT over various baselines, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

However, some critical points need consideration:

* **Reproducibility:** The paper lacks detailed information about the LLM prompts and parameters used, potentially hindering reproducibility. While prompt templates are shown, specific parameter settings (e.g., temperature, top-p) are missing.
* **Scalability:** The reliance on LLMs for multiple stages (purpose extraction, path pruning, answer generation) might create a bottleneck for extremely large knowledge graphs or complex queries.  The computational cost isn't extensively discussed.
* **Generalizability:** Although the authors claim ORT is a "plug-and-play" method,  the performance might depend on the quality of the knowledge graph ontology and the specific LLM used. Further exploration of its performance across diverse knowledge graphs and LLMs is warranted.
* **Explainability:** While the framework is presented as interpretable due to the explicit reasoning paths, the LLM's role in path selection and answer generation introduces a "black box" element that reduces overall transparency.


Despite these weaknesses, the conceptual novelty of the reverse-thinking approach, the strong empirical results, and the potential for improved LLM-KG integration justify a high score.

### DAST: Context-Aware Compression in LLMs via Dynamic Allocation of Soft Tokens
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11493v1)
- **Authors**: Shaoshen Chen, Yangning Li, Zishan Xu, Yinghui Li, Xin Su, Zifei Shan, Hai-tao Zheng
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) face computational inefficiencies and redundant processing when handling long context inputs, prompting a focus on compression techniques. While existing semantic vector-based compression methods achieve promising performance, these methods fail to account for the intrinsic information density variations between context chunks, instead allocating soft tokens uniformly across context chunks. This uniform distribution inevitably diminishes allocation to information-critical regions. To address this, we propose Dynamic Allocation of Soft Tokens (DAST), a simple yet effective method that leverages the LLM's intrinsic understanding of contextual relevance to guide compression. DAST combines perplexity-based local information with attention-driven global information to dynamically allocate soft tokens to the informative-rich chunks, enabling effective, context-aware compression. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DAST surpasses state-of-the-art methods.
- **Summary**: DAST (Dynamic Allocation of Soft Tokens) is a novel context compression method for Large Language Models (LLMs) that addresses the limitations of existing approaches.  Unlike previous methods that allocate soft tokens uniformly across context chunks, regardless of information density, DAST dynamically assigns soft tokens based on both local (perplexity-based) and global (attention-weighted) importance scores. This context-aware allocation prioritizes information-rich regions, leading to more effective compression and improved performance on downstream tasks.  Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DAST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness across varying compression ratios.  An ablation study confirms the contributions of both the local and global information components.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM context compression. The core idea of dynamically allocating soft tokens based on a combined local and global importance score is innovative and intuitively appealing.  The experimental results strongly support the effectiveness of DAST, demonstrating consistent improvements over existing techniques across different benchmarks and compression levels. The ablation study provides further evidence of the method's components working in synergy.  The inclusion of detailed experimental setup and ablation studies enhances the paper's credibility.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on perplexity and attention scores, while intuitive, might not capture all aspects of information importance. The method's performance on much larger LLMs remains unexplored, representing a significant limitation given the increasing trend towards larger models.  The authors acknowledge the need for further investigation into potential issues like hallucinations and catastrophic forgetting introduced by the compression process.  The paper also lacks a deep dive into the computational cost of the dynamic allocation process itself â€“ is the overhead negligible compared to the gains from reduced context length?

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, DAST represents a significant advancement in LLM context compression, proposing a novel and effective approach backed by strong empirical evidence.  While the scalability and potential negative side effects need further investigation, the current findings are compelling enough to warrant a high score.

### Stop Looking for Important Tokens in Multimodal Language Models: Duplication Matters More
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11494v1)
- **Authors**: Zichen Wen, Yifeng Gao, Shaobo Wang, Junyuan Zhang, Qintong Zhang, Weijia Li, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang
- **Abstract**: Vision tokens in multimodal large language models often dominate huge computational overhead due to their excessive length compared to linguistic modality. Abundant recent methods aim to solve this problem with token pruning, which first defines an importance criterion for tokens and then prunes the unimportant vision tokens during inference. However, in this paper, we show that the importance is not an ideal indicator to decide whether a token should be pruned. Surprisingly, it usually results in inferior performance than random token pruning and leading to incompatibility to efficient attention computation operators.Instead, we propose DART (Duplication-Aware Reduction of Tokens), which prunes tokens based on its duplication with other tokens, leading to significant and training-free acceleration. Concretely, DART selects a small subset of pivot tokens and then retains the tokens with low duplication to the pivots, ensuring minimal information loss during token pruning. Experiments demonstrate that DART can prune 88.9% vision tokens while maintaining comparable performance, leading to a 1.99$\times$ and 2.99$\times$ speed-up in total time and prefilling stage, respectively, with good compatibility to efficient attention operators. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ZichenWen1/DART.
- **Summary**: This paper challenges the common practice of using attention scores to identify "important" tokens for pruning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  The authors argue that importance-based pruning methods suffer from several flaws: they ignore token interactions during pruning, are incompatible with efficient attention mechanisms like FlashAttention, exhibit positional bias, and surprisingly, often perform worse than random pruning.  Instead, they propose DART (Duplication-Aware Reduction of Tokens), a training-free method that prunes tokens based on their duplication with other tokens. DART selects a small subset of pivot tokens and retains tokens with low similarity to these pivots.  Experiments across multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that DART achieves significant speedups (up to 1.99x total inference time and 2.99x prefill time) while maintaining comparable or even superior performance to existing methods, even with an 88.9% reduction in vision tokens.  The paper includes theoretical analysis supporting the effectiveness of DART.  The authors also show that the choice of pivot tokens is relatively insensitive to performance, highlighting the importance of duplication over individual token importance.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a compelling argument against the prevalent importance-based token pruning approach in MLLMs.  The empirical evidence demonstrating the inferiority of importance-based methods to random pruning is particularly striking and contributes significantly to the field's understanding of efficient inference.  The proposed DART method is simple, efficient, and achieves impressive speedups with minimal performance degradation. The theoretical analysis provides a further layer of support. The extensive experimentation across multiple models and benchmarks strengthens the conclusions.


However, some weaknesses exist. The paper focuses heavily on the shortcomings of importance-based methods without deeply exploring why duplication works so well. A more in-depth theoretical understanding of why removing duplicate tokens leads to such good results would significantly strengthen the paper.  The limitation of applicability to black-box models is acknowledged, but further discussion on potential adaptations or alternatives for such models would be beneficial.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's strong empirical results, clear argumentation, and significant challenge to established practices position it as a valuable contribution to the field. The findings have the potential to shift the focus of research on MLLM efficiency towards alternative strategies beyond importance-based methods.

### Balanced Multi-Factor In-Context Learning for Multilingual Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11495v1)
- **Authors**: Masahiro Kaneko, Alham Fikri Aji, Timothy Baldwin
- **Abstract**: Multilingual large language models (MLLMs) are able to leverage in-context learning (ICL) to achieve high performance by leveraging cross-lingual knowledge transfer without parameter updates. However, their effectiveness is highly sensitive to example selection, particularly in multilingual settings. Based on the findings of existing work, three key factors influence multilingual ICL: (1) semantic similarity, (2) linguistic alignment, and (3) language-specific performance. However, existing approaches address these factors independently, without explicitly disentangling their combined impact, leaving optimal example selection underexplored. To address this gap, we propose balanced multi-factor ICL (\textbf{BMF-ICL}), a method that quantifies and optimally balances these factors for improved example selection. Experiments on mCSQA and TYDI across four MLLMs demonstrate that BMF-ICL outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights the importance of incorporating all three factors and the importance of selecting examples from multiple languages.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Balanced Multi-Factor In-Context Learning (BMF-ICL), a novel method for improving multilingual in-context learning (MICL) in large language models (LLMs).  Existing MICL methods typically address factors like semantic similarity, linguistic alignment, and language-specific performance independently. BMF-ICL, in contrast, quantifies these three factors using LaBSE for semantic similarity, lang2vec for linguistic alignment, and MLLM likelihoods for language-specific performance.  It then optimally balances these factors via a weighted sum, learned on development data, to select the most effective examples for the prompt.  Experiments on mCSQA and TYDI datasets with four different MLLMs show BMF-ICL consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly when the target language is *not* included in the example pool.  Ablation studies highlight the importance of considering all three factors jointly.

**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of multilingual in-context learning. The core idea of explicitly quantifying and balancing multiple factors influencing example selection in MICL is a significant advancement over previous heuristic or single-factor approaches.  The use of established embedding models (LaBSE and lang2vec) provides a principled and reproducible way to measure these factors. The comprehensive experimental evaluation across multiple LLMs and datasets strengthens the findings.  The ablation study convincingly demonstrates the synergistic effect of combining the three factors.

However, the novelty isn't groundbreaking.  The individual components (semantic similarity, linguistic alignment, language-specific performance) have been explored before, albeit separately. The main contribution lies in their *combined and optimized* use.  While the results are impressive, the field is rapidly evolving, and the long-term impact might be limited unless BMF-ICL demonstrates significant advantages over future, more sophisticated MICL techniques. The reliance on existing embedding models also limits the inherent novelty; a truly novel contribution might involve developing new embedding methods specifically tailored for MICL.  Furthermore, the paper doesn't deeply analyze *why* the specific weighting scheme works best; more theoretical understanding would further strengthen the contribution.


**Strengths:**

* **Clearly defined problem:** The paper identifies a crucial limitation in existing MICL methodsâ€”the lack of integrated multi-factor optimization.
* **Well-motivated approach:** BMF-ICL's methodology is clearly explained and justified.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The experiments are extensive and well-designed, covering multiple LLMs, datasets, and baselines.
* **Strong results:** BMF-ICL consistently outperforms existing methods.
* **Insightful analysis:** The ablation study and language diversity analysis offer valuable insights into the relative importance of different factors.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental novelty:** While significant, the core idea isn't entirely novel; it's a sophisticated combination of existing techniques.
* **Lack of theoretical depth:**  The paper lacks a deeper theoretical understanding of *why* the optimal weights are what they are.
* **Limited scope:** The evaluation focuses on specific question-answering tasks.  Generalizability to other tasks needs further investigation.


Score: 7

The paper makes a solid contribution to the field, improving the state-of-the-art in MICL.  However, the incremental nature of the novelty, along with the absence of deeper theoretical analysis and a more expansive evaluation, prevents it from achieving a higher score.  The work is well-executed and provides a useful framework, but it's not a transformative leap forward.

### Token Pruning in Multimodal Large Language Models: Are We Solving the Right Problem?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11501v1)
- **Authors**: Zichen Wen, Yifeng Gao, Weijia Li, Conghui He, Linfeng Zhang
- **Abstract**: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance for cross-modal understanding and generation, yet still suffer from severe inference costs. Recently, abundant works have been proposed to solve this problem with token pruning, which identifies the redundant tokens in MLLMs and then prunes them to reduce the computation and KV storage costs, leading to significant acceleration without training. While these methods claim efficiency gains, critical questions about their fundamental design and evaluation remain unanswered: Why do many existing approaches underperform even compared to naive random token selection? Are attention-based scoring sufficient for reliably identifying redundant tokens? Is language information really helpful during token pruning? What makes a good trade-off between token importance and duplication? Are current evaluation protocols comprehensive and unbiased? The ignorance of previous research on these problems hinders the long-term development of token pruning. In this paper, we answer these questions one by one, providing insights into the design of future token pruning methods.
- **Summary**: This paper, "Token Pruning in Multimodal Large Language Models: Are We Solving the Right Problem?", challenges the current approaches to token pruning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  Existing methods, often relying on attention-based scoring and language information, are shown to underperform simple baselines like random token selection and pooling.  The authors attribute this to a positional bias in attention-based methods and argue that spatial uniformity in retained tokens is crucial.  They demonstrate this by modifying an existing method (FastV) to incorporate spatial uniformity, improving its performance.  Furthermore, they find that the value of language information in token pruning is task-dependent, being more beneficial for text-heavy tasks.  The paper also critiques the common use of FLOPs as an evaluation metric, advocating for actual latency measurements instead, and highlights the importance of considering training-aware compression techniques already present in some MLLMs.  Finally, it proposes a framework for balancing token importance and redundancy using an information-theoretic approach.

**Rigorous Rationale and Score:**

The paper makes a significant contribution by identifying and addressing critical flaws in the existing research on token pruning for MLLMs.  The empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of simple baselines over more sophisticated methods is compelling and forces a re-evaluation of current approaches.  The identification of positional bias as a major issue is insightful and leads to a practical improvement in a state-of-the-art method. The information-theoretic framework provides a valuable theoretical foundation for future research.  The critique of the evaluation methodology is also important, pushing the field toward more rigorous benchmarking.

However, the paper's scope is somewhat limited.  While the findings are significant for the models and datasets evaluated, more extensive testing across a wider range of architectures and tasks would strengthen the conclusions.  The proposed adaptive scoring mechanism (Eq. 6) feels somewhat ad-hoc, lacking the depth of theoretical justification given to other aspects of the paper.  Further, the analysis focuses heavily on a few specific methods, potentially neglecting other potentially relevant approaches.

Considering the strengths (identifying and addressing key weaknesses in existing approaches, proposing a novel framework, rigorous empirical evaluation) and weaknesses (limited scope, ad-hoc aspects of proposed method), the paper represents a strong contribution to the field. It significantly impacts how researchers think about and approach token pruning in MLLMs.  The paper's findings are likely to be highly influential and lead to improved methods in the future.

- **Summary**: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of Chinese Spelling Correction (CSC), a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).  It traces the evolution of CSC methods from rule-based and statistical approaches to the current dominance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and the emerging exploration of large language models (LLMs).  The survey details various model architectures (Information-Learning and Detector-Corrector), focusing on how they leverage phonetic and visual features of Chinese characters.  It critically analyzes existing benchmark datasets, highlighting their limitations and biases, and proposes future research directions, particularly emphasizing the potential of LLMs while acknowledging their current challenges in handling variable output lengths and overcorrection.  The authors claim this is the first comprehensive survey dedicated to CSC.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by offering a much-needed systematic review of the CSC literature. Its strength lies in its comprehensive coverage of various methods, architectures, and datasets, providing a clear overview for researchers entering the field.  The detailed analysis of existing datasets and their limitations is particularly useful, highlighting the need for better, more representative data. The discussion of the challenges and opportunities presented by LLMs is timely and relevant, given the current excitement surrounding these models.  The identification of specific issues like overcorrection and length control problems in LLMs applied to CSC is insightful.

However, the paper's novelty is limited. While it compiles existing knowledge effectively, it doesn't introduce groundbreaking new methodologies or theoretical frameworks.  The proposed future research directions, while relevant, are largely incremental improvements on existing approaches rather than paradigm shifts.  Furthermore, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth comparative analysis of different models, potentially including quantitative comparisons of their performance across various datasets. The structure, while logical, could be improved with more concise explanations and less redundancy in some sections.


Considering its strengths and weaknesses, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field by consolidating and contextualizing existing research.  It serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, but its originality is not exceptional.

### MaZO: Masked Zeroth-Order Optimization for Multi-Task Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11513v1)
- **Authors**: Zhen Zhang, Yifan Yang, Kai Zhen, Nathan Susanj, Athanasios Mouchtaris, Siegfried Kunzmann, Zheng Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks, but their fine-tuning demands significant memory, posing challenges for resource-constrained environments. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a memory-efficient alternative by eliminating the need for backpropagation. However, ZO optimization suffers from high gradient variance, and prior research has largely focused on single-task learning, leaving its application to multi-task learning unexplored. Multi-task learning is crucial for leveraging shared knowledge across tasks to improve generalization, yet it introduces unique challenges under ZO settings, such as amplified gradient variance and collinearity. In this paper, we present MaZO, the first framework specifically designed for multi-task LLM fine-tuning under ZO optimization. MaZO tackles these challenges at the parameter level through two key innovations: a weight importance metric to identify critical parameters and a multi-task weight update mask to selectively update these parameters, reducing the dimensionality of the parameter space and mitigating task conflicts. Experiments demonstrate that MaZO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even multi-task learning methods designed for first-order optimization.
- **Summary**: MaZO: Masked Zeroth-Order Optimization for Multi-Task Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models introduces a novel framework for efficiently fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on multiple tasks using only forward passes (zeroth-order optimization).  Existing zeroth-order methods suffer from high gradient variance, especially in multi-task settings where conflicting gradients exacerbate the problem. MaZO addresses this by introducing a weight importance metric to identify critical parameters and a multi-task weight update mask to selectively update these parameters, thus reducing the dimensionality of the optimization problem and mitigating task conflicts.  Experiments on LLaMA-2-7B and Mistral-7B demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, surpassing even first-order multi-task learning methods.  The paper also includes an ablation study investigating hyperparameter sensitivity and a discussion of computational efficiency.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of efficient LLM fine-tuning.  The core idea of using a mask to selectively update parameters based on a weight importance metric is novel in the context of zeroth-order multi-task learning.  The method effectively addresses a known limitation of zeroth-order optimization â€“ high variance â€“ in the challenging multi-task setting.  The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of MaZO over existing approaches.  The ablation study further strengthens the paper by providing insights into the hyperparameter choices and the impact of LoRA.  The detailed explanation of the challenges in applying standard multi-task learning techniques to zeroth-order optimization and the thorough discussion of related work are commendable.

However, some limitations exist. The row-wise approximation for gradient and Hessian computation, while improving computational efficiency, might sacrifice some accuracy.  The computational overhead introduced by the weight importance calculation, though marginal, is still a factor.  The experiments are limited to 7B parameter models; scalability to much larger models needs further investigation. While the paper acknowledges the lack of theoretical convergence analysis, referring to related work does not fully compensate for this absence. A more comprehensive theoretical justification would strengthen the paper significantly.

Despite these limitations, the significant improvement in performance over existing methods in a challenging setting (zeroth-order multi-task learning) along with the thorough experimental evaluation and ablation study justify a high score.

### Investigating Inference-time Scaling for Chain of Multi-modal Thought: A Preliminary Study
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11514v1)
- **Authors**: Yujie Lin, Ante Wang, Moye Chen, Jingyao Liu, Hao Liu, Jinsong Su, Xinyan Xiao
- **Abstract**: Recently, inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) has been demonstrated as a promising approach for addressing multi-modal reasoning tasks. While existing studies have predominantly centered on text-based thinking, the integration of both visual and textual modalities within the reasoning process remains unexplored. In this study, we pioneer the exploration of inference-time scaling with multi-modal thought, aiming to bridge this gap. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we systematically investigate popular sampling-based and tree search-based inference-time scaling methods on 10 challenging tasks spanning various domains. Besides, we uniformly adopt a consistency-enhanced verifier to ensure effective guidance for both methods across different thought paradigms. Results show that multi-modal thought promotes better performance against conventional text-only thought, and blending the two types of thought fosters more diverse thinking. Despite these advantages, multi-modal thoughts necessitate higher token consumption for processing richer visual inputs, which raises concerns in practical applications. We hope that our findings on the merits and drawbacks of this research line will inspire future works in the field.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates inference-time scaling for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in multi-modal scenarios, specifically focusing on integrating visual and textual information.  Previous work primarily focused on text-based CoT; this study explores the benefits and drawbacks of incorporating visual information into each reasoning step.  They tested various sampling-based (Self-Consistency, Best-of-N) and tree-search-based (Beam Search, MCTS) inference-time scaling methods on ten datasets across geometry, mathematics, and visual question answering.  Results show that multi-modal CoT significantly outperforms text-only CoT, especially with tree search methods, but at the cost of increased token consumption.  A novel consistency-enhanced verifier is proposed to improve the reliability of the inference methods. The paper concludes that multi-modal CoT is promising but requires further research to improve efficiency and verifier robustness.


**Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution by exploring a relatively under-researched area: the application of inference-time scaling to multi-modal CoT. The empirical evaluation is extensive, covering multiple datasets and methods. The introduction of the consistency-enhanced verifier is a noteworthy contribution, addressing limitations of existing verifier approaches. The detailed error analysis provides useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different methods.

However, the novelty is somewhat limited.  While the application of inference-time scaling to multi-modal CoT is novel, the core techniques (CoT, Best-of-N, Beam Search, MCTS) are well-established. The improvement from the consistency-enhanced verifier, while useful, might not be considered a groundbreaking methodological advancement.  The reliance on code generation for visual manipulation instead of direct image generation limits the generality of the findings. The discussion of limitations is thorough, acknowledging these shortcomings.


The potential influence on the field is moderate. The results clearly highlight the potential of multi-modal CoT but also its limitations regarding computational cost. This could guide future research towards more efficient multi-modal models and verifiers.  The paper's contribution lies primarily in its comprehensive empirical study and the careful analysis of the trade-offs involved.  The identification of the verifier's limitations as a crucial bottleneck is a significant takeaway.

Score: 7

Rationale: The paper's strength lies in its comprehensive empirical investigation and detailed analysis of a timely and important problem.  However, the novelty is incremental rather than revolutionary, and the proposed verifier improvement, while useful, doesn't represent a major methodological breakthrough. The limitations acknowledged by the authors also hold back the overall score.  A score of 7 reflects a solid contribution that advances the field but doesn't represent a paradigm shift.

### SayAnything: Audio-Driven Lip Synchronization with Conditional Video Diffusion
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11515v1)
- **Authors**: Junxian Ma, Shiwen Wang, Jian Yang, Junyi Hu, Jian Liang, Guosheng Lin, Jingbo chen, Kai Li, Yu Meng
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models have led to significant progress in audio-driven lip synchronization. However, existing methods typically rely on constrained audio-visual alignment priors or multi-stage learning of intermediate representations to force lip motion synthesis. This leads to complex training pipelines and limited motion naturalness. In this paper, we present SayAnything, a conditional video diffusion framework that directly synthesizes lip movements from audio input while preserving speaker identity. Specifically, we propose three specialized modules including identity preservation module, audio guidance module, and editing control module. Our novel design effectively balances different condition signals in the latent space, enabling precise control over appearance, motion, and region-specific generation without requiring additional supervision signals or intermediate representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SayAnything generates highly realistic videos with improved lip-teeth coherence, enabling unseen characters to say anything, while effectively generalizing to animated characters.
- **Summary**: SayAnything is a conditional video diffusion model for audio-driven lip synchronization.  Unlike previous methods that rely on intermediate representations or additional supervision (like SyncNet), SayAnything directly synthesizes lip movements from audio input while preserving speaker identity. It achieves this through a novel multi-modal condition fusion scheme incorporating three specialized modules: an identity preservation module, an audio guidance module, and an editing control module with adaptive masking.  Experiments and user studies demonstrate improved realism, temporal consistency, and generalization to various styles (including animated characters) compared to state-of-the-art methods.  The paper also addresses potential ethical concerns regarding deepfake misuse.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

SayAnything makes a valuable contribution to the field of audio-driven lip synchronization. The direct approach of conditioning the video diffusion model on audio and visual cues simultaneously, without relying on intermediate steps or external supervision, is a significant methodological advance. The adaptive masking strategy is cleverly designed to address the issue of motion leakage, a common problem in this area.  The quantitative results, showing improvement across multiple metrics compared to existing methods, are compelling.  The user study further strengthens the claim of improved visual quality and user preference.  The acknowledgment and discussion of ethical implications also demonstrate responsible research practice.

However, the paper's novelty isn't revolutionary.  The core idea of using conditional video diffusion is not entirely new.  The innovation lies primarily in the specific design of the multi-modal fusion scheme and the adaptive masking. The computational cost remains high, limiting its immediate practical applications. The reliance on a pre-trained Stable Video Diffusion model raises questions about the extent of true innovation, as much of the performance may be attributed to the pre-trained model's capabilities. While the improvements over baselines are shown, a more detailed analysis comparing to a wider range of recent methods would strengthen the conclusions.


Considering both the strengths and weaknesses, SayAnything presents a solid contribution to the field.  Its innovative fusion scheme and improved performance justify a strong positive rating.  However, the incremental nature of the innovation and remaining computational limitations prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.

### Learning to Keep a Promise: Scaling Language Model Decoding Parallelism with Learned Asynchronous Decoding
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11517v1)
- **Authors**: Tian Jin, Ellie Y. Cheng, Zack Ankner, Nikunj Saunshi, Blake M. Elias, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, Suvinay Subramanian, Michael Carbin
- **Abstract**: Decoding with autoregressive large language models (LLMs) traditionally occurs sequentially, generating one token after another. An emerging line of work explored parallel decoding by identifying and simultaneously generating semantically independent chunks of LLM responses. However, these techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics tied to syntactic structures like lists and paragraphs, making them rigid and imprecise. We present PASTA, a learning-based system that teaches LLMs to identify semantic independence and express parallel decoding opportunities in their own responses. At its core are PASTA-LANG and its interpreter: PASTA-LANG is an annotation language that enables LLMs to express semantic independence in their own responses; the language interpreter acts on these annotations to orchestrate parallel decoding on-the-fly at inference time. Through a two-stage finetuning process, we train LLMs to generate PASTA-LANG annotations that optimize both response quality and decoding speed. Evaluation on AlpacaEval, an instruction following benchmark, shows that our approach Pareto-dominates existing methods in terms of decoding speed and response quality; our results demonstrate geometric mean speedups ranging from 1.21x to 1.93x with corresponding quality changes of +2.2% to -7.1%, measured by length-controlled win rates against sequential decoding baseline.
- **Summary**: PASTA is a novel system that accelerates large language model (LLM) decoding by enabling learned asynchronous decoding.  Unlike previous methods relying on hand-crafted heuristics to identify semantically independent chunks for parallel generation, PASTA trains the LLM to generate its own annotations (using PASTA-LANG) marking these opportunities.  A custom interpreter then uses these annotations to orchestrate parallel decoding at inference time.  A two-stage finetuning process optimizes both response quality and decoding speed.  Experiments on AlpacaEval demonstrate that PASTA Pareto-dominates existing asynchronous decoding methods, achieving geometric mean speedups of 1.21x to 1.93x with varying impacts on quality (+2.2% to -7.1% win rate change against a sequential baseline).  The paper also explores the sensitivity of the system to key design choices like the number of optimization iterations, positional embedding strategies, and the preference scoring metric.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

PASTA presents a significant advancement in LLM inference optimization. The core idea of teaching the LLM to identify its own parallelization opportunities is novel and addresses a key limitation of prior rule-based approaches. The creation of PASTA-LANG and its interpreter provides a practical framework for implementing this learned parallelism. The two-stage finetuning, incorporating preference optimization to balance quality and speed, is a well-designed methodology.  The thorough experimental evaluation, including sensitivity analysis, strengthens the paper's conclusions.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on a specific LLM (Gemini) for both annotation and judging might limit generalizability. The reported speedups, while impressive, are relative to a specific baseline and hardware setup, necessitating further validation across different LLMs and architectures. While the sensitivity analysis is valuable, it could benefit from more extensive exploration of the hyperparameter space.  The complexity of the system, involving a custom annotation language and interpreter, may pose a barrier to adoption. Finally, the impact of the learned asynchronous decoding on memory usage is not explicitly addressed in sufficient detail.

Despite these weaknesses, the overall novelty and potential impact on the field are substantial. PASTA offers a more scalable and adaptable approach to parallel decoding than existing heuristic-based methods, paving the way for more efficient and potentially cost-effective LLM inference.  The introduction of a learned annotation system opens up new avenues for research in LLM optimization and autonomous resource management.

### AURORA:Automated Training Framework of Universal Process Reward Models via Ensemble Prompting and Reverse Verification
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11520v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaoyu Tan, Tianchu Yao, Chao Qu, Bin Li, Minghao Yang, Dakuan Lu, Haozhe Wang, Xihe Qiu, Wei Chu, Yinghui Xu, Yuan Qi
- **Abstract**: The reasoning capabilities of advanced large language models (LLMs) like o1 have revolutionized artificial intelligence applications. Nevertheless, evaluating and optimizing complex reasoning processes remain significant challenges due to diverse policy distributions and the inherent limitations of human effort and accuracy. In this paper, we present AURORA, a novel automated framework for training universal process reward models (PRMs) using ensemble prompting and reverse verification. The framework employs a two-phase approach: First, it uses diverse prompting strategies and ensemble methods to perform automated annotation and evaluation of processes, ensuring robust assessments for reward learning. Second, it leverages practical reference answers for reverse verification, enhancing the model's ability to validate outputs and improving training accuracy. To assess the framework's performance, we extend beyond the existing ProcessBench benchmark by introducing UniversalBench, which evaluates reward predictions across full trajectories under diverse policy distribtion with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that AURORA enhances process evaluation accuracy, improves PRMs' accuracy for diverse policy distributions and long-CoT responses. The project will be open-sourced at https://auroraprm.github.io/. The Universal-PRM-7B is available at https://huggingface.co/infly/Universal-PRM-7B.
- **Summary**: AURORA is an automated framework for training universal Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate the reasoning steps of Large Language Models (LLMs).  It addresses the limitations of existing PRM training methods by using a two-phase approach:  First, it employs ensemble prompting with diverse LLM-based policies and multiple prompting strategies to automatically annotate reasoning processes, creating a robust training dataset. Second, it incorporates reverse verification, using reference answers to validate outputs and improve training accuracy.  The framework is evaluated on ProcessBench and a new benchmark, UniversalBench (designed for longer Chain-of-Thought outputs), showing improved accuracy and generalization compared to existing methods.  The trained model (Universal-PRM-7B) and the UniversalBench are open-sourced.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

Score: 7

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a significant problem:**  The paper tackles the crucial challenge of automatically evaluating the complex reasoning processes of LLMs, a bottleneck in developing more reliable and robust AI systems.  Manual annotation is expensive and time-consuming, so automated methods are vital.
* **Novel methodological contributions:** AURORA introduces several novel aspects, including the combination of ensemble prompting with diverse policies and the incorporation of reverse verification using reference answers.  These are not simply incremental improvements but represent a more sophisticated approach to PRM training.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper evaluates AURORA on existing benchmarks and introduces a new benchmark (UniversalBench), addressing limitations of existing benchmarks by focusing on longer Chain-of-Thought outputs. This demonstrates a thorough approach to validating the framework's performance.
* **Open-sourcing:** Making the trained model and the new benchmark publicly available significantly increases the impact of the work, allowing others to build upon it and further validate its findings.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental improvement on existing LLM-as-a-judge approach:** While the ensemble prompting and reverse verification are valuable additions, they build upon the already existing LLM-as-a-judge paradigm.  The novelty might be considered incremental rather than revolutionary.
* **Limited analysis of the limitations of the ensemble method:** While the authors mention addressing bias and variance, a deeper dive into the limitations of the ensemble approach (e.g., potential for error propagation from individual LLMs, sensitivity to LLM choices) would strengthen the paper.
* **Potential for bias in the UniversalBench:** The creation of UniversalBench involves human curation. While the authors mention steps to mitigate bias, a detailed discussion of the potential biases introduced during curation and how these were addressed would be beneficial.
* **Lack of direct comparison with very recent SOTA models:** The paper compares to models that may not represent the very latest advancements in PRM development, limiting the ability to precisely quantify the contribution.



**Overall:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation and reward modeling.  AURORA offers a more sophisticated and automated approach to PRM training, improving accuracy and generalization. The open-sourcing aspect significantly enhances its impact. However, the incremental nature of some of the contributions and the need for more in-depth analysis of certain aspects prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The paper demonstrates progress but doesn't necessarily represent a paradigm shift in the field.

### DeFiScope: Detecting Various DeFi Price Manipulations with LLM Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11521v1)
- **Authors**: Juantao Zhong, Daoyuan Wu, Ye Liu, Maoyi Xie, Yang Liu, Yi Li, Ning Liu
- **Abstract**: DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is one of the most important applications of today's cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. It manages hundreds of billions in Total Value Locked (TVL) on-chain, yet it remains susceptible to common DeFi price manipulation attacks. Despite state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems like DeFiRanger and DeFort, we found that they are less effective to non-standard price models in custom DeFi protocols, which account for 44.2% of the 95 DeFi price manipulation attacks reported over the past three years. In this paper, we introduce the first LLM-based approach, DeFiScope, for detecting DeFi price manipulation attacks in both standard and custom price models. Our insight is that large language models (LLMs) have certain intelligence to abstract price calculation from code and infer the trend of token price changes based on the extracted price models. To further strengthen LLMs in this aspect, we leverage Foundry to synthesize on-chain data and use it to fine-tune a DeFi price-specific LLM. Together with the high-level DeFi operations recovered from low-level transaction data, DeFiScope detects various DeFi price manipulations according to systematically mined patterns. Experimental results show that DeFiScope achieves a high precision of 96% and a recall rate of 80%, significantly outperforming SOTA approaches. Moreover, we evaluate DeFiScope's cost-effectiveness and demonstrate its practicality by helping our industry partner confirm 147 real-world price manipulation attacks, including discovering 81 previously unknown historical incidents.
- **Summary**: DeFiScope is a novel approach to detecting decentralized finance (DeFi) price manipulation attacks using large language models (LLMs).  Existing methods struggle with custom price models prevalent in DeFi protocols. DeFiScope addresses this by leveraging LLMs to infer price changes from code and on-chain data, bypassing the need for explicit exchange rate calculations.  The authors fine-tune an LLM using simulated on-chain data generated by Foundry, improving its ability to reason about price changes.  A transfer graph is constructed to recover high-level DeFi operations, which are then matched against eight systematically mined price manipulation patterns.  Evaluation on real-world datasets shows DeFiScope achieves high precision (96%) and recall (80%), significantly outperforming existing tools.  The paper also highlights DeFiScope's cost-effectiveness and practicality, aiding in the confirmation of numerous real-world attacks, including previously unknown incidents.


**Critical Evaluation and Score Justification:**

DeFiScope makes a valuable contribution to the field of DeFi security. The core idea of using LLMs to reason about price changes directly from code and transaction data is novel and addresses a significant limitation of existing approaches.  The fine-tuning strategy, using simulated data and a Chain-of-Thought prompting approach, is well-motivated and demonstrably improves performance. The systematic mining of attack patterns and the integration with high-level DeFi operation recovery enhance the system's robustness.  The extensive evaluation using three real-world datasets strengthens the claims of superior performance and practicality. The discussion of limitations, such as handling cross-transaction attacks and closed-source code, is honest and points towards fruitful future research directions.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on open-source code is a limitation, although the authors address this partially. The accuracy of the LLM's price change inference relies on the LLM's capabilities, which may not always be perfect, particularly for complex price models.  The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the LLM's reasoning process to better understand its strengths and weaknesses. The selection of the 96,800 benign transactions from DeFort's dataset is an important element of the evaluation but needs more justification.  The specific criteria for considering these transactions benign needs elaboration.  Finally, while the paper mentions integration with Program-Aided Language models, this is not fully explored.

Despite these weaknesses, the overall contribution is substantial.  The innovative use of LLMs for DeFi security analysis opens up new possibilities and the results are impressive. The paper's clear presentation and thorough evaluation make it a strong contribution to the field.

### Training Large Language Models to be Better Rule Followers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11525v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Hu, Shijia Kang, Haotong Yang, Haotian Xu, Muhan Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they often exhibit unexpected failures in seemingly straightforward tasks, suggesting a reliance on case-based reasoning rather than rule-based reasoning. While the vast training corpus of LLMs contains numerous textual "rules", current training methods fail to leverage these rules effectively. Crucially, the relationships between these "rules" and their corresponding "instances" are not explicitly modeled. As a result, while LLMs can often recall rules with ease, they fail to apply these rules strictly and consistently in relevant reasoning scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the rule-following capabilities of LLMs and propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT) to enhance the cross-task transferability of rule-following abilities. We first construct a dataset of 88 tasks requiring following rules, encompassing diverse reasoning domains. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that models trained on large-scale rule-following tasks are better rule followers, outperforming the baselines in both downstream fine-tuning and few-shot prompting scenarios. This highlights the cross-task transferability of models with the aid of Meta-RFFT. Furthermore, we examine the influence of factors such as dataset size, rule formulation, and in-context learning.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in rule-following, specifically their tendency towards case-based reasoning rather than rule-based reasoning.  The authors propose Meta Rule-Following Fine-Tuning (Meta-RFFT), a two-stage training method.  The first stage (RF-pretraining) fine-tunes the LLM on a large, diverse dataset of 88 rule-following tasks across various domains (code execution, symbolic reasoning, etc.). The second stage adapts the pretrained model to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning or few-shot prompting. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-RFFT significantly improves LLMs' ability to generalize to longer sequences (length generalization) compared to baselines, highlighting the cross-task transferability of rule-following skills.  The authors analyze errors, focusing on loop control issues, and explore the impact of dataset size and different rule representations (code vs. natural language).  They conclude that Meta-RFFT fosters a "meta rule-following" ability, enabling more robust and efficient rule application in LLMs.


**Critical Evaluation and Score:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM training and reasoning.  The identification of the problem â€“ LLMs struggling to consistently apply learned rules â€“ is well-established, but the proposed solution, Meta-RFFT, offers a novel approach to address it. The use of a large, diverse dataset for pretraining is a strength, as is the systematic evaluation across various tasks and the detailed error analysis. The demonstration of improved length generalization and in-context learning is compelling evidence of the method's effectiveness.  The exploration of different rule representations also contributes to the paper's robustness.

However, some weaknesses exist. The paper focuses heavily on length generalization as a proxy for rule-following, potentially overlooking other aspects of rule application. The reliance on a specific LLM architecture (Qwen) could limit the generalizability of the findings. While the error analysis is insightful, a more in-depth investigation into the internal model representations and mechanisms behind the improved performance would strengthen the paper.  Furthermore, the claim of "meta rule-following" needs further theoretical justification beyond the empirical results.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, this paper represents a significant advancement in understanding and improving LLM reasoning capabilities.  The proposed Meta-RFFT framework provides a practical and effective technique for enhancing rule-following performance, and its findings are likely to influence future research in LLM training methodologies.

- **Authors**: Jiahong Liu, Zexuan Qiu, Zhongyang Li, Quanyu Dai, Jieming Zhu, Minda Hu, Menglin Yang, Irwin King
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in handling general knowledge tasks, yet they struggle with user-specific personalization, such as understanding individual emotions, writing styles, and preferences. Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) tackle these challenges by leveraging individual user data, such as user profiles, historical dialogues, content, and interactions, to deliver responses that are contextually relevant and tailored to each user's specific needs. This is a highly valuable research topic, as PLLMs can significantly enhance user satisfaction and have broad applications in conversational agents, recommendation systems, emotion recognition, medical assistants, and more. This survey reviews recent advancements in PLLMs from three technical perspectives: prompting for personalized context (input level), finetuning for personalized adapters (model level), and alignment for personalized preferences (objective level). To provide deeper insights, we also discuss current limitations and outline several promising directions for future research. Updated information about this survey can be found at the https://github.com/JiahongLiu21/Awesome-Personalized-Large-Language-Models.
- **Summary**: This survey paper, "A Survey of Personalized Large Language Models: Progress and Future Directions," reviews recent advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized user experiences.  The authors categorize existing methods into three levels:  personalized prompting (input level), personalized adaptation (model level), and personalized alignment (objective level). Each level is further subdivided, providing a detailed taxonomy with numerous examples of relevant research.  The paper also identifies key challenges, including data privacy, bias, and efficient adaptation to model updates, and proposes promising future research directions such as multimodal personalization and edge computing deployment.  A supplementary Github repository provides additional details and resources.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by providing a much-needed structured overview of a rapidly evolving area. The taxonomy presented is a significant strength, offering a clear framework for understanding the diverse approaches to personalization in LLMs. The comprehensive review of existing methods, categorized by technical level, aids in comparison and identification of research gaps. The discussion of future directions is also insightful, highlighting crucial challenges and opportunities for advancement.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  While the organization and taxonomy are helpful, the core concepts and techniques discussed are already present in the literature.  The paper synthesizes existing knowledge rather than presenting new breakthroughs.  The level of critical analysis in comparing different methods could also be strengthened; more in-depth comparisons of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including empirical comparisons where available, would significantly enhance the paper's value. The reliance on numerous citations without deeper synthesis potentially leads to an overwhelming amount of information for the reader, hindering efficient comprehension of the key trends and distinctions.

The paper's significance lies in its accessibility and organization.  It serves as a valuable resource for researchers entering the field, providing a structured overview that simplifies navigation of the complex and rapidly expanding literature. However, its impact may be lessened by the lack of novel contributions beyond the organization itself.  The potential influence on the field is primarily in its function as a comprehensive guide and resource, rather than a catalyst for fundamentally new research directions.

Score: 7

**Rationale:** The score reflects the paper's substantial contribution in synthesizing existing research and providing a useful taxonomy, but it also accounts for the limited novelty beyond organization and the potential for improved critical analysis. The paper is valuable as a resource but doesn't represent a major theoretical or methodological breakthrough in the field.

### Control-CLIP: Decoupling Category and Style Guidance in CLIP for Specific-Domain Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11532v1)
- **Authors**: Zexi Jia, Chuanwei Huang, Hongyan Fei, Yeshuang Zhu, Zhiqiang Yuan, Jinchao Zhang, Jie Zhou
- **Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities of generating high-quality images closely aligned with textual inputs. However, the effectiveness of text guidance heavily relies on the CLIP text encoder, which is trained to pay more attention to general content but struggles to capture semantics in specific domains like styles. As a result, generation models tend to fail on prompts like "a photo of a cat in Pokemon style" in terms of simply producing images depicting "a photo of a cat". To fill this gap, we propose Control-CLIP, a novel decoupled CLIP fine-tuning framework that enables the CLIP model to learn the meaning of category and style in a complement manner. With specially designed fine-tuning tasks on minimal data and a modified cross-attention mechanism, Control-CLIP can precisely guide the diffusion model to a specific domain. Moreover, the parameters of the diffusion model remain unchanged at all, preserving the original generation performance and diversity. Experiments across multiple domains confirm the effectiveness of our approach, particularly highlighting its robust plug-and-play capability in generating content with various specific styles.
- **Summary**: Control-CLIP is a method for improving text-to-image generation by fine-tuning the CLIP model to better understand style and category information within specific domains.  Instead of fine-tuning the entire CLIP model or the diffusion model itself, Control-CLIP decouples style and category features using two separate encoders. These are trained with either cross-entropy loss (for datasets with style labels) or triplet loss (for datasets without explicit style labels).  A modified cross-attention mechanism then integrates these decoupled features into the Stable Diffusion model, allowing for plug-and-play style and category control during image generation without requiring any changes to the diffusion model's parameters.  Experiments show improved performance on style and category discrimination tasks, and better quality and fidelity of generated images in comparison to baselines.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach to CLIP Fine-tuning:** The decoupling of style and category features within CLIP is a novel approach that addresses a significant limitation of existing methods.  The use of separate encoders and tailored loss functions is a clever solution to this problem.
* **Plug-and-Play Integration:** The method's plug-and-play nature is a significant advantage, making it easily adaptable to existing diffusion models without requiring extensive retraining. This lowers the computational cost and barrier to entry for adoption.
* **Improved Generation Quality:** The experimental results demonstrate a clear improvement in the quality and fidelity of generated images, particularly concerning style consistency.  The use of AHR as a metric, while subjective, is appropriate given the nature of the task.
* **Addressing a Real-World Problem:** The paper tackles a common issue in text-to-image generation where models struggle with nuanced style descriptions, making it relevant to the practical applications of the technology.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper evaluates Control-CLIP on several datasets, the number of datasets and the specific styles used are relatively limited.  More extensive evaluations across diverse and larger datasets would strengthen the claims.
* **Subjectivity of AHR:** The reliance on Average Human Ranking for evaluating generation quality introduces subjectivity.  While acknowledged by the authors, the lack of more objective metrics like FID or CLIP score is a limitation.
* **Computational Cost of Two Encoders:** While the plug-and-play aspect is a strength, the use of two separate encoders might add some computational overhead during inference compared to other methods. This aspect needs further discussion.
* **Comparatively limited quantitative comparison**: While Control-CLIP outperforms other approaches in the results tables, a more in-depth comparison with alternative fine-tuning methods, with more discussion of the hyperparameter tuning process used, would have been beneficial.


**Overall Significance and Novelty:**

Control-CLIP presents a valuable contribution to the field of text-to-image generation.  The novel decoupling of style and category features in CLIP, combined with the plug-and-play integration, addresses a significant challenge in controlling the style of generated images.  While the evaluation could be more comprehensive, the results demonstrate a clear improvement over existing approaches.  The potential impact on the field is notable, especially concerning ease of integration and practical application.

Score: 8

The score reflects the significant novelty and practical impact of Control-CLIP. While some limitations exist in the evaluation and scope, the core contribution of decoupling style and category features and enabling plug-and-play integration is a substantial advancement that warrants a high score.  Further research extending the evaluations and addressing the minor weaknesses identified above could push this score even higher.

### Be Cautious When Merging Unfamiliar LLMs: A Phishing Model Capable of Stealing Privacy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11533v1)
- **Authors**: Zhenyuan Guo, Yi Shi, Wenlong Meng, Chen Gong, Chengkun Wei, Wenzhi Chen
- **Abstract**: Model merging is a widespread technology in large language models (LLMs) that integrates multiple task-specific LLMs into a unified one, enabling the merged model to inherit the specialized capabilities of these LLMs. Most task-specific LLMs are sourced from open-source communities and have not undergone rigorous auditing, potentially imposing risks in model merging. This paper highlights an overlooked privacy risk: \textit{an unsafe model could compromise the privacy of other LLMs involved in the model merging.} Specifically, we propose PhiMM, a privacy attack approach that trains a phishing model capable of stealing privacy using a crafted privacy phishing instruction dataset. Furthermore, we introduce a novel model cloaking method that mimics a specialized capability to conceal attack intent, luring users into merging the phishing model. Once victims merge the phishing model, the attacker can extract personally identifiable information (PII) or infer membership information (MI) by querying the merged model with the phishing instruction. Experimental results show that merging a phishing model increases the risk of privacy breaches. Compared to the results before merging, PII leakage increased by 3.9\% and MI leakage increased by 17.4\% on average. We release the code of PhiMM through a link.
- **Summary**: This paper explores a novel privacy vulnerability in the increasingly popular practice of Large Language Model (LLM) merging.  The authors introduce PHIMM, a privacy-stealing attack that involves training a "phishing model" capable of extracting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or inferring Membership Information (MI) from the training data of other LLMs.  This phishing model is cleverly cloaked to appear as a benign task-specific model, thus luring unsuspecting users to merge it with their own models.  Once merged, the attacker can extract private information by querying the merged model with specially crafted instructions. Experiments demonstrate a significant increase in PII and MI leakage after merging the phishing model. The paper also investigates several factors influencing attack success, including model merging methods, model size, and the type of PII targeted. While acknowledging limitations such as the separate training of DEA and MIA models, the authors propose future directions, including multi-task learning and the use of synthetic data.

**Rigorous Evaluation and Score Rationale:**

The paper presents a significant contribution to the security and privacy research of LLMs, particularly highlighting a previously overlooked vulnerability associated with model merging.  The attack methodology is well-described, and the experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of PHIMM.  The inclusion of ablation studies investigating the impact of various factors (e.g., model merging methods, model size, recollection mechanism, balance loss) strengthens the paper's overall contribution.  The identification of a potential mitigation strategy through special character embedding in the phishing model is also a valuable addition.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The assumption that an attacker has access to partial training data to craft the phishing dataset is a significant limitation.  The reliance on a single, potentially flawed, metric (ASR) for evaluating DEA success in some scenarios could benefit from further analysis.  Furthermore, the "unfair" comparison of the PHIMM MIA attack against established logit-based methods requires careful interpretation. While the paper proposes several avenues for future work, addressing the data dependency and the limitations of the MIA comparison would strengthen the conclusions.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's novelty in uncovering this critical vulnerability in model merging and its well-conducted experiments justify a high score.  The findings are likely to significantly influence the development of more robust security practices within the LLM community, prompting researchers and developers to reconsider the security implications of merging unfamiliar models. The research contributes to a much-needed conversation about responsible LLM development and deployment.

### MuSC: Improving Complex Instruction Following with Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11541v1)
- **Authors**: Hui Huang, Jiaheng Liu, Yancheng He, Shilong Li, Bing Xu, Conghui Zhu, Muyun Yang, Tiejun Zhao
- **Abstract**: Complex instruction-following with elaborate constraints is imperative for Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing methods have constructed data for complex instruction alignment, they all rely on a more advanced model, especially GPT-4, limiting their application. In this paper, we propose a Multi-granularity Self-Contrastive Training (MuSC) framework, to improve the complex instruction alignment without relying on a stronger model. Our method is conducted on both coarse and fine granularity. On coarse-granularity, we construct constraint-aware preference data based on instruction decomposition and recombination. On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods.
- **Summary**: MuSC is a novel framework for improving complex instruction following in Large Language Models (LLMs) without relying on stronger models like GPT-4.  It employs a multi-granularity self-contrastive training approach.  At a coarse granularity, it constructs constraint-aware preference data by decomposing complex instructions into constraints, dropping some, and recombining to create positive and negative instruction-response pairs.  At a fine granularity, it uses a token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level weights based on model confidence, focusing optimization on tokens violating constraints. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models show significant improvements on complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, outperforming existing self-alignment methods.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

MuSC presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM alignment, addressing the limitations of existing methods that depend on powerful, proprietary models for data generation. The multi-granularity approach is intuitively appealing and addresses a crucial aspect of complex instruction following: the nuanced understanding of multiple constraints.  The use of model confidence to guide fine-grained optimization is also innovative and potentially broadly applicable.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of MuSC across multiple benchmarks and model architectures.  The ablation studies further strengthen the argument by showing the impact of individual components.

However, the paper's novelty isn't entirely groundbreaking.  The core ideas â€“ contrastive learning and fine-grained optimization â€“ are not new.  The paper's main contribution lies in the specific combination and application of these techniques to the problem of complex instruction following, and the clever use of model confidence as a low-cost, effective supervisory signal. While the paper thoroughly addresses the limitations of its predecessors, it doesn't explicitly address or compare against other recent work in the rapidly evolving field of self-alignment.  The reliance on GPT-4 for evaluation is a limitation, though acknowledged by the authors.  Finally, the paper could benefit from more in-depth analysis of the learned representations and the mechanisms underlying the improvement.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, MuSC represents a significant advance in self-supervised LLM alignment, offering a practical and scalable solution.  Its impact is likely to be substantial, especially for researchers and practitioners working with open-source LLMs.

### DCAD-2000: A Multilingual Dataset across 2000+ Languages with Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11546v1)
- **Authors**: Yingli Shen, Wen Lai, Shuo Wang, Xueren Zhang, Kangyang Luo, Alexander Fraser, Maosong Sun
- **Abstract**: The rapid development of multilingual large language models (LLMs) highlights the need for high-quality, diverse, and clean multilingual datasets. In this paper, we introduce DCAD-2000 (Data Cleaning as Anomaly Detection), a large-scale multilingual corpus built using newly extracted Common Crawl data and existing multilingual datasets. DCAD-2000 includes over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents, spanning 155 high- and medium-resource languages and 159 writing scripts. To overcome the limitations of current data cleaning methods, which rely on manual heuristic thresholds, we propose reframing data cleaning as an anomaly detection task. This dynamic filtering approach significantly enhances data quality by identifying and removing noisy or anomalous content. We evaluate the quality of DCAD-2000 on the FineTask benchmark, demonstrating substantial improvements in multilingual dataset quality and task performance.
- **Summary**: DCAD-2000 is a new multilingual dataset containing over 2,282 languages, 46.72TB of data, and 8.63 billion documents.  It uses updated Common Crawl data and integrates existing multilingual datasets like MaLA and Fineweb-2.  Unlike traditional data cleaning methods relying on manual heuristic thresholds, DCAD-2000 employs anomaly detection (specifically Isolation Forest) on eight extracted document features to identify and remove noisy content in a language-agnostic manner.  Evaluated on the FineTask benchmark, models trained on DCAD-2000 significantly outperform those trained on other multilingual datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of its data cleaning approach and the high quality of the resulting corpus.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

Score: 7

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**

* **Scale and Coverage:** The sheer scale of DCAD-2000 (2,282 languages, 46.72TB) is a significant contribution.  The inclusion of a substantial number of high and medium-resource languages, alongside low-resource ones, addresses a crucial gap in existing multilingual datasets.
* **Novel Data Cleaning Approach:**  The framing of data cleaning as an anomaly detection problem offers a potentially more robust and scalable solution compared to traditional threshold-based methods.  The language-agnostic nature is a key advantage, avoiding the computationally expensive and potentially biased process of per-language threshold tuning.
* **Empirical Validation:** The evaluation on FineTask provides strong empirical evidence supporting the dataset's quality and the effectiveness of the data cleaning method.  The consistent outperformance compared to other datasets is compelling.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Model Scope:**  The evaluation is restricted to the LLaMA-3.2-1B model.  While the authors acknowledge this limitation, the generalizability of the findings to larger, more powerful LLMs remains unproven.  This significantly limits the impact of the findings.
* **Black-Box Nature of Anomaly Detection:** While the authors justify their choice of Isolation Forest,  a deeper dive into the interpretability of the anomaly detection process would strengthen the paper.  Understanding *why* specific documents are flagged as anomalies could reveal biases or limitations in the feature set.
* **Data Source Bias:**  While the paper mentions integrating multiple data sources, a more detailed analysis of potential biases stemming from these sources (e.g., geographical, topical, or stylistic biases within Common Crawl) is missing.  This is a critical aspect for any large-scale dataset.


**Potential Influence:**

DCAD-2000 has the potential to significantly impact the field of multilingual NLP, particularly in training large language models. Its scale and improved data quality are valuable assets. However, the limited scope of the evaluation and the lack of deeper analysis regarding potential biases hold back its overall impact. Future work addressing these weaknesses could elevate its significance.

### Equilibrate RLHF: Towards Balancing Helpfulness-Safety Trade-off in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11555v1)
- **Authors**: Yingshui Tan, Yilei Jiang, Yanshi Li, Jiaheng Liu, Xingyuan Bu, Wenbo Su, Xiangyu Yue, Xiaoyong Zhu, Bo Zheng
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) based on human preferences, commonly achieved through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), has been effective in improving their performance. However, maintaining LLM safety throughout the fine-tuning process remains a significant challenge, as resolving conflicts between safety and helpfulness can be non-trivial. Typically, the safety alignment of LLM is trained on data with safety-related categories. However, our experiments find that naively increasing the scale of safety training data usually leads the LLMs to an ``overly safe'' state rather than a ``truly safe'' state, boosting the refusal rate through extensive safety-aligned data without genuinely understanding the requirements for safe responses. Such an approach can inadvertently diminish the models' helpfulness. To understand the phenomenon, we first investigate the role of safety data by categorizing them into three different groups, and observe that each group behaves differently as training data scales up. To boost the balance between safety and helpfulness, we propose an Equilibrate RLHF framework including a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that achieves better safety alignment even with fewer training data, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach, which selectively highlight the key segments through a gradient masking strategy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the safety alignment of LLMs while balancing safety and helpfulness.
- **Summary**: This paper addresses the challenge of balancing helpfulness and safety in Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).  The authors find that simply increasing the amount of safety-related training data leads to "overly safe" models that are less helpful, rather than "truly safe" models.  They propose Equilibrate RLHF, a framework with two key components: a Fine-grained Data-centric (FDC) approach that categorizes safety data (explicit, implicit, and mixed risk) for more effective training, and an Adaptive Message-wise Alignment (AMA) approach that uses gradient masking to focus on crucial segments during RL training. Experiments show that Equilibrate RLHF significantly improves safety alignment while maintaining helpfulness.  The limitations acknowledged include the lack of sophisticated red-teaming and the reliance on external knowledge for handling factual risks.


Score: 7

Rationale:

Strengths:

* **Addresses a critical problem:** The paper tackles the important and under-researched issue of the trade-off between safety and helpfulness in RLHF-trained LLMs.  The observation that simply increasing safety data can be detrimental is a valuable contribution.
* **Novel approach:** The Equilibrate RLHF framework, with its FDC and AMA components, offers a novel approach to address the safety-helpfulness dilemma.  The fine-grained data categorization and the adaptive message-wise alignment are innovative ideas.
* **Empirical validation:** The paper presents extensive experimental results supporting the claims, comparing the proposed method to several baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:

* **Limited novelty in individual components:** While the combination of FDC and AMA is novel, the individual components (fine-grained data analysis and gradient masking) are not entirely new concepts in the broader machine learning field.
* **Lack of strong theoretical justification:**  The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation for why the proposed methods work as well as they do. The explanations are largely empirical.
* **Addressing factual risks:** The paper acknowledges the reliance on RAG for handling factual risks which introduces new vulnerabilities (data poisoning, etc.). A more robust solution to this is needed.
* **Limited adversarial testing:** The paper mentions the absence of sophisticated red-teaming methods, a significant weakness in evaluating the robustness of the safety improvements.


Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution by highlighting the limitations of naive scaling of safety data in RLHF and proposing a novel framework to address this. While the individual components aren't entirely novel, their combination and the empirical validation demonstrate effectiveness.  However, the lack of strong theoretical grounding and limitations in adversarial testing prevent a higher score.

### Auto-Search and Refinement: An Automated Framework for Gender Bias Mitigation in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11559v1)
- **Authors**: Yue Xu, Chengyan Fu, Li Xiong, Sibei Yang, Wenjie Wang
- **Abstract**: Pre-training large language models (LLMs) on vast text corpora enhances natural language processing capabilities but risks encoding social biases, particularly gender bias. While parameter-modification methods like fine-tuning mitigate bias, they are resource-intensive, unsuitable for closed-source models, and lack adaptability to evolving societal norms. Instruction-based approaches offer flexibility but often compromise task performance. To address these limitations, we propose $\textit{FaIRMaker}$, an automated and model-independent framework that employs an $\textbf{auto-search and refinement}$ paradigm to adaptively generate Fairwords, which act as instructions integrated into input queries to reduce gender bias and enhance response quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\textit{FaIRMaker}$ automatically searches for and dynamically refines Fairwords, effectively mitigating gender bias while preserving task integrity and ensuring compatibility with both API-based and open-source LLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces FaIRMaker, a model-independent framework for mitigating gender bias in large language models (LLMs).  Unlike resource-intensive parameter-modification methods, FaIRMaker uses an automated search and refinement process to generate "Fairwords"â€”instructions prepended to user queries.  These Fairwords guide the LLM toward unbiased responses without requiring model access or significantly impacting performance on standard tasks.  The framework first automatically searches for effective Fairwords using a gradient-based approach and then refines them into natural language instructions via a seq2seq model, enabling application to both open-source and API-based LLMs. Experiments demonstrate FaIRMaker's effectiveness in reducing gender bias across various LLMs while maintaining or improving performance on general tasks.  Ablation studies highlight the importance of both the auto-search and refinement components.  The authors also analyze the interpretability of the generated Fairwords, suggesting a correlation between their emotional tone and effectiveness.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

Score: 7

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty in Approach:** The auto-search and refinement paradigm is a novel approach to bias mitigation. It cleverly leverages the strengths of both automated prompt engineering and the flexibility of instruction-following in LLMs, addressing limitations of existing methods.  The model-agnostic nature is a significant advantage.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper presents a thorough experimental evaluation across multiple LLMs (both open-source and API-based), using diverse datasets and metrics.  Ablation studies provide insights into the framework's components.
* **Practical Significance:** The method offers a practical solution for mitigating bias in LLMs without requiring model modification or extensive retraining.  This is particularly valuable for closed-source models and resource-constrained environments.
* **Interpretability Attempt:** The attempt to analyze the underlying mechanisms of the Fairwords, although preliminary, adds value by offering potential avenues for future research.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope of Bias:** The focus is solely on gender bias, limiting the generalizability of the findings.  Other forms of bias need to be investigated.
* **Dependence on Evaluator LLMs:** The evaluation relies heavily on the judgment of other LLMs (GPT-4 and Llama 3.1), which themselves might contain biases, potentially affecting the results.  More robust evaluation methods (including human evaluation) would strengthen the paper's claims.
* **Potential Overfitting:** While ablation studies were conducted, concerns about potential overfitting to the specific preference dataset used remain.  The generalizability to other datasets and bias scenarios requires further investigation.
* **Fairwords Selection Strategy:** The random selection of Fairwords during inference may limit optimal performance. A more sophisticated selection strategy tailored to the input query context could improve results.


**Potential Influence:**

FaIRMaker presents a promising approach to bias mitigation. Its model-agnostic nature and relatively low computational cost make it a significant contribution.  The paper could influence future research by inspiring the development of similar frameworks for other types of biases and exploring more sophisticated Fairword generation and selection strategies.  However, addressing the limitations mentioned above is crucial for wider adoption and impact.

### Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11564v1)
- **Authors**: Jaehyeong Jo, Sung Ju Hwang
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models in modeling discrete categorical data. Yet diffusion models that directly work on discrete data space do not fully exploit the power of iterative refinement, as the signals are lost during the transition between discrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data have limited performance compared to discrete approaches, and the unclear link between them restricts the development of diffusion models for discrete data. In this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling that incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We establish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold, and building on the analogy, we introduce a simple design for the diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete diffusion models. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial symmetry and a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the manifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other modalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models and approaches the performance of autoregressive models. Codes available at \href{https://github.com/harryjo97/RDLM}{https://github.com/harryjo97/RDLM}.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces the Riemannian Diffusion Language Model (RDLM), a novel continuous diffusion model for language modeling and other discrete data modalities.  RDLM addresses limitations of existing discrete and continuous diffusion models by leveraging the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution.  It establishes a connection between discrete diffusion and continuous flow on the statistical manifold, proposing a diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete approaches.  A simulation-free training framework based on radial symmetry and a technique to address high dimensionality (dimension splitting) are also introduced.  Experiments on language modeling benchmarks (Text8 and One Billion Words), image modeling (CIFAR-10), and biological sequence design demonstrate improved performance compared to existing discrete diffusion models and competitive results against autoregressive models.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a significant advancement in diffusion models for discrete data.  The key innovation lies in explicitly incorporating the geometric structure of the categorical distribution using the statistical manifold. This is a departure from previous approaches that either ignored the geometry or relied on strong prior assumptions.  The proposed simulation-free training method is a crucial contribution, addressing a major computational bottleneck in applying diffusion models to high-dimensional discrete data.  The generalization of discrete diffusion processes to continuous flows on the manifold is theoretically elegant and provides a more unified framework.

However, the paper's strength in theoretical contributions does not entirely translate to overwhelming empirical superiority. While RDLM outperforms existing *discrete* diffusion models, its advantage over *autoregressive* models is less clear-cut, often showing comparable rather than significantly better performance.  The complexity of the proposed method, involving concepts from Riemannian geometry, might hinder widespread adoption.  The reliance on approximations (e.g., for the transition distribution) needs further investigation to fully assess the impact on performance. Finally, the "dimension splitting" technique, while helpful for high-dimensional data, feels somewhat ad-hoc.


Considering these factors, the paper demonstrates a notable contribution to the field, but it falls short of being a groundbreaking breakthrough. The theoretical contributions and the innovative training methodology are significant, but the empirical improvements, while present, aren't dramatically transformative across all benchmarks.  The potential impact is substantial, however, as it opens new avenues for developing more efficient and effective diffusion models for discrete data, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios.

### Towards Reasoning Ability of Small Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11569v1)
- **Authors**: Gaurav Srivastava, Shuxiang Cao, Xuan Wang
- **Abstract**: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs), appearing at or above a certain scale ($\sim$100B parameters). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. SLMs are increasingly favored for their efficiency and deployability. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the reasoning abilities of diverse SLMs, including those trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. This raises a critical question: Can SLMs achieve reasoning abilities comparable to LLMs? In this work, we systematically survey, benchmark, and analyze 72 SLMs from six model families across 14 reasoning benchmarks. For reliable evaluation, we examine four evaluation methods and compare four LLM judges against human evaluations on 800 data points. We repeat all experiments three times to ensure a robust performance assessment. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different prompting strategies in small models. Beyond accuracy, we also evaluate model robustness under adversarial conditions and intermediate reasoning steps. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression. They can serve as efficient alternatives to LLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks.
- **Summary**: This paper systematically benchmarks the reasoning capabilities of 72 small language models (SLMs) across 14 reasoning benchmarks, challenging the prevailing assumption that strong reasoning is solely an emergent property of large language models (LLMs).  The authors compare four evaluation methods, finding that GPT-4-Turbo and GPT-4o most closely align with human judgments.  Their comprehensive evaluation includes SLMs trained from scratch and those derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation.  Results show that while LLMs generally outperform SLMs, certain open-source SLMs rival proprietary LLMs in intermediate reasoning.  Quantization is shown to be a more effective compression technique than pruning or distillation for preserving reasoning abilities.  The study also investigates the impact of prompting strategies and model robustness under adversarial conditions.  However, the reliance on GPT-4 as an evaluator introduces potential bias, and the sorting task's reliance on regex parsing may affect accuracy.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of small language models by providing a comprehensive and systematic benchmark of their reasoning capabilities.  The large-scale evaluation across diverse model architectures and compression techniques is a significant strength. The finding that certain SLMs can achieve competitive performance with LLMs, especially in intermediate reasoning, is a noteworthy contribution that challenges existing assumptions and opens up possibilities for more efficient and deployable reasoning systems.  The analysis of different prompting strategies and robustness evaluations further enhance the paper's contribution.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited. While the scale of the benchmark is impressive, the core ideaâ€”that smaller models can perform surprisingly well at reasoningâ€”has been explored in previous works.  The reliance on GPT-4 for evaluation, while acknowledged as a limitation, introduces a degree of subjectivity and potential bias that could affect the interpretation of the results. The paper's methodology is rigorous but not groundbreaking, and the conclusions are largely consistent with existing trends in the field.

The paper's potential influence on the field is significant. It offers practical guidance for researchers selecting and deploying SLMs for reasoning-intensive tasks, particularly by highlighting the effectiveness of quantization as a compression technique.  It encourages further research into improving instruction-following capabilities of SLMs and exploring more robust compression strategies.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in reasoning capabilities. However, they still face challenges such as high computational demands and privacy concerns. This paper focuses on developing efficient Small Language Models (SLMs) and Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) that retain competitive reasoning abilities. We introduce a novel training pipeline that enhances reasoning capabilities and facilitates deployment on edge devices, achieving state-of-the-art performance while minimizing development costs. \InfR~ aims to advance AI systems by improving reasoning, reducing adoption barriers, and addressing privacy concerns through smaller model sizes. Resources are available at https://github. com/Reallm-Labs/InfiR.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces InfiR, a suite of small language models (SLMs) and multimodal small language models (MSLMs) designed for efficient reasoning.  Addressing the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in terms of computational cost and privacy, InfiR utilizes novel pre- and post-training pipelines to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various reasoning benchmarks at a significantly reduced parameter scale (1B and 1.6B parameters).  The pre-training pipeline focuses on high-quality data curation and filtering, incorporating code and reasoning-oriented text.  Post-training leverages supervised fine-tuning with carefully selected and synthesized datasets to enhance instruction following and reasoning abilities.  The multimodal variant integrates a vision encoder with the SLM, achieving strong performance on visual reasoning tasks. The paper details the data pipelines, training procedures, and experimental results, demonstrating significant improvements over existing small models.  However, the reliance on a large number of existing datasets and pre-trained models, while improving efficiency, reduces the novelty of the core methodology.

**Rigorous Rationale and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of efficient and accessible AI. The achievement of state-of-the-art performance on various reasoning benchmarks using significantly smaller models is noteworthy. The detailed description of the data curation and training pipelines is a strength, allowing for reproducibility.  However, the novelty is somewhat limited. The core methodology relies heavily on existing large language models and datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning,  acting more as an optimization and adaptation of existing techniques rather than introducing fundamentally new approaches. While the improvements are significant, they are incremental rather than revolutionary.  The claims of state-of-the-art performance should be critically examined, especially considering the potentially selective nature of benchmark comparisons.  The paper also lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations of its approach beyond a brief concluding statement.

### Large Language Models and Mathematical Reasoning Failures
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11574v1)
- **Authors**: Johan Boye, Birger Moell
- **Abstract**: This paper investigates the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using 50 newly constructed high-school-level word problems. Unlike prior studies that focus solely on answer correctness, we rigorously analyze both final answers and solution steps to identify reasoning failures. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models - including Mixtral, Llama, Gemini, GPT-4o, and OpenAI's o1 variants - we find that while newer models (e.g., o3-mini, deepseek-r1) achieve higher accuracy, all models exhibit errors in spatial reasoning, strategic planning, and arithmetic, sometimes producing correct answers through flawed logic. Common failure modes include unwarranted assumptions, over-reliance on numerical patterns, and difficulty translating physical intuition into mathematical steps. Manual analysis reveals that models struggle with problems requiring multi-step deduction or real-world knowledge, despite possessing broad mathematical knowledge. Our results underscore the importance of evaluating reasoning processes, not just answers, and caution against overestimating LLMs' problem-solving proficiency. The study highlights persistent gaps in LLMs' generalization abilities, emphasizing the need for targeted improvements in structured reasoning and constraint handling.
- **Summary**: This paper evaluates the mathematical reasoning capabilities of eight state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on a newly created dataset of 50 high-school level word problems.  Unlike previous studies that focused solely on answer accuracy, this research meticulously analyzes both the final answers and the solution steps to identify reasoning failures.  The authors find that while newer models show higher accuracy, all models exhibit weaknesses in spatial reasoning, strategic planning, and arithmetic, often arriving at correct answers through flawed logic. Common errors include unwarranted assumptions, over-reliance on numerical patterns, and an inability to translate physical intuition into mathematical steps. The study highlights the importance of evaluating the reasoning process itself, rather than just the final answer, and cautions against overestimating LLMs' problem-solving abilities.  The persistent gaps in generalization abilities revealed underscore the need for targeted improvements in structured reasoning and constraint handling within LLMs.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation by shifting the focus from simple accuracy to a more nuanced analysis of the reasoning process. The creation of a new dataset specifically designed to expose weaknesses in LLM reasoning is a strength.  The manual analysis of solution steps, while time-consuming, provides significantly richer insights than automated evaluation alone. The identification of specific failure modes (spatial reasoning, strategic planning, etc.) is helpful for directing future research and development efforts.

However, some limitations weaken the paper's overall impact.  The relatively small dataset (50 problems) limits the generalizability of the findings.  The single-query approach per model also raises concerns about the robustness of the results.  Further, the lack of access to internal model processes (chain-of-thought printouts) restricts the depth of analysis possible. While the paper acknowledges these limitations, their impact on the conclusions remains a concern.  The novelty lies primarily in the thorough analysis of the *process* rather than groundbreaking new methodology or results, although this process-focused approach is a significant advancement in LLM evaluation.

The paper's potential influence is moderate. It contributes to a growing body of work highlighting the limitations of LLMs, particularly in areas requiring complex reasoning. This knowledge is crucial for guiding future development and responsible deployment of LLMs. However, the impact may be limited by the dataset size and the rapid pace of LLM advancement.  The findings are likely to be relevant for some time, but the specific models evaluated may quickly become outdated.

### Language Complexity Measurement as a Noisy Zero-Shot Proxy for Evaluating LLM Performance
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11578v1)
- **Authors**: Birger Moell, Johan Boye
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in natural language generation but often face challenges in tasks requiring precise calculations and structural analysis. This paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on language complexity measurement tasks, through the computation of the LIX readability metric and Average Dependency Distance (ADD). Using Swedish high school and university-level essays, we evaluate the models' abilities to compute LIX scores and perform dependency parsing, comparing their results to established ground truths. Our findings reveal that while all models demonstrate some capacity for these tasks, ChatGPT-o1-mini performs most consistently, achieving the highest accuracy in both LIX computation and dependency parsing. Additionally, we observe a strong significant correlation -0.875 p 0.026 (N=6) between the models' accuracy in computing LIX and their overall performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. These results suggest that language complexity measurement abilities can serve as a noisy zero-shot proxies for assessing the general capabilities of LLMs, providing a practical method for model evaluation without the need for extensive benchmarking datasets.
- **Summary**: This paper explores using language complexity metrics (LIX readability score and Average Dependency Distance) as a zero-shot proxy for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) performance.  The authors tested six state-of-the-art LLMs on Swedish text, comparing their LIX calculations and dependency parsing to ground truth.  ChatGPT-o1-mini showed the most consistent performance across both tasks.  Importantly, a strong negative correlation was found between the models' LIX error and their scores on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, suggesting that LLM proficiency in language complexity measurement correlates with overall capability.  The paper acknowledges limitations, including the use of a single run per task, focus on Swedish essays, reliance on proprietary models, and potential tokenization variations.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper presents an interesting approach to LLM evaluation, offering a potentially simpler and cheaper alternative to extensive benchmarking datasets. The correlation between LIX error and MMLU score is a significant finding, suggesting a valuable proxy for assessing general LLM capabilities.  However, several weaknesses significantly limit the paper's impact and novelty:

* **Limited Scope:** The reliance on Swedish high-school and university essays severely restricts generalizability.  Different languages and text types could yield vastly different results.  The small sample size (N=6 models) further weakens the statistical power of the findings, particularly concerning the correlation analysis.

* **Methodological Concerns:** The single-run evaluation lacks robustness.  The dependency parsing comparison, complicated by varying tokenization, is not rigorously explained and might introduce bias.  The paper does not control for potential differences in model training data that could affect performance on these specific tasks.

* **Lack of Novel Methodology:** While the application to LLM evaluation is new, the underlying techniques (LIX, ADD, dependency parsing) are well-established.  The core contribution is the observed correlation, but the lack of deeper exploration into *why* this correlation exists limits the conceptual advancement.

* **Limited Practical Impact:**  While the proposed method is simpler than comprehensive benchmarking, its current limitations â€“ particularly the language and data dependency â€“ restrict its immediate practical use for a broader community.

While the idea of using readily computable linguistic complexity as a proxy for LLM evaluation has merit, the paper's execution, limited scope, and lack of deeper analytical investigation prevent it from being a substantial contribution to the field.  The findings are intriguing but require significantly more rigorous testing and broader validation before they can be considered a reliable and broadly applicable evaluation method.

- **Authors**: Jiaze Li, Yaya Shi, Zongyang Ma, Haoran Xu, Feng Cheng, Huihui Xiao, Ruiwen Kang, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Di Zhang
- **Abstract**: Enhancing the fine-grained instance spatiotemporal motion perception capabilities of Video Large Language Models is crucial for improving their temporal and general video understanding. However, current models struggle to perceive detailed and complex instance motions. To address these challenges, we have made improvements from both data and model perspectives. In terms of data, we have meticulously curated iMOVE-IT, the first large-scale instance-motion-aware video instruction-tuning dataset. This dataset is enriched with comprehensive instance motion annotations and spatiotemporal mutual-supervision tasks, providing extensive training for the model's instance-motion-awareness. Building on this foundation, we introduce iMOVE, an instance-motion-aware video foundation model that utilizes Event-aware Spatiotemporal Efficient Modeling to retain informative instance spatiotemporal motion details while maintaining computational efficiency. It also incorporates Relative Spatiotemporal Position Tokens to ensure awareness of instance spatiotemporal positions. Evaluations indicate that iMOVE excels not only in video temporal understanding and general video understanding but also demonstrates significant advantages in long-term video understanding.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces iMOVE, a video foundation model designed to improve instance-level spatiotemporal motion perception in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs).  The authors address the limitations of current Video-LLMs in accurately perceiving detailed instance motions by improving both the data and the model.

Data-wise, they create iMOVE-IT, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with detailed instance motion annotations and spatiotemporal mutual-supervision tasks (spatial grounding, temporal grounding, and instance dynamic captioning). Model-wise, iMOVE employs Event-aware Spatiotemporal Efficient Modeling to efficiently encode key instance motions and Relative Spatiotemporal Position Tokens to enhance positional awareness.  Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate iMOVE's superior performance in video temporal understanding, general video understanding, and especially long-term video understanding, exceeding existing state-of-the-art methods in several zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Addressing a significant limitation:** The paper tackles a crucial problem in Video-LLMs: the lack of fine-grained instance-level motion understanding. This is a genuine limitation hindering the application of Video-LLMs to many real-world tasks.
* **Comprehensive approach:** The authors address the issue from both data and model perspectives, creating a new dataset and proposing novel architectural components. This holistic approach is a strength.
* **Strong empirical results:**  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate iMOVE's superior performance across various benchmarks and settings.  The ablation study provides further insights into the contribution of individual components.
* **Novel dataset:**  iMOVE-IT appears to be a valuable contribution to the field, providing a much-needed resource for training Video-LLMs with a focus on instance motion.  The automated pipeline for creating the dataset is also noteworthy.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental novelty:** While the combination of the dataset and the model is novel, individual components (e.g., relative positional encoding, event-based modeling) have been explored in other works. The paper needs to better highlight the unique synergistic effect of combining these elements.
* **Limited analysis of computational cost:** The paper mentions computational efficiency but lacks a detailed comparison of the computational cost of iMOVE versus other comparable models. This is crucial for evaluating the practicality of the proposed approach.
* **Potential for bias:** The automated pipeline for generating the iMOVE-IT dataset could introduce biases. A thorough discussion of potential biases and mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.
* **Overemphasis on zero-shot performance:**  While zero-shot performance is important, the paper could have better balanced its emphasis on zero-shot and fine-tuned results. Fine-tuning usually yields better performance and is a more common practical scenario.


**Overall Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Video-LLMs.  The creation of iMOVE-IT is a notable achievement, and the proposed model architecture demonstrates improvements in instance-level motion understanding. However, the incremental novelty of the individual components and the lack of a detailed computational cost analysis prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.  The potential influence on the field is significant, especially in driving further research on large-scale datasets focused on instance motion and the development of more sophisticated spatiotemporal modeling techniques within Video-LLMs.

### Can LLM Watermarks Robustly Prevent Unauthorized Knowledge Distillation?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11598v1)
- **Authors**: Leyi Pan, Aiwei Liu, Shiyu Huang, Yijian Lu, Xuming Hu, Lijie Wen, Irwin King, Philip S. Yu
- **Abstract**: The radioactive nature of Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking enables the detection of watermarks inherited by student models when trained on the outputs of watermarked teacher models, making it a promising tool for preventing unauthorized knowledge distillation. However, the robustness of watermark radioactivity against adversarial actors remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether student models can acquire the capabilities of teacher models through knowledge distillation while avoiding watermark inheritance. We propose two categories of watermark removal approaches: pre-distillation removal through untargeted and targeted training data paraphrasing (UP and TP), and post-distillation removal through inference-time watermark neutralization (WN). Extensive experiments across multiple model pairs, watermarking schemes and hyper-parameter settings demonstrate that both TP and WN thoroughly eliminate inherited watermarks, with WN achieving this while maintaining knowledge transfer efficiency and low computational overhead. Given the ongoing deployment of watermarking techniques in production LLMs, these findings emphasize the urgent need for more robust defense strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/THU-BPM/Watermark-Radioactivity-Attack.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the robustness of Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques against unauthorized knowledge distillation.  Existing research demonstrates that watermarks embedded in LLMs ("teacher models") are inherited by student models trained on their outputs, allowing for detection of unauthorized training. This paper challenges this assumption by introducing three watermark removal attacks:  untargeted and targeted pre-distillation paraphrasing (UP and TP), and post-distillation watermark neutralization (WN).  Experiments across multiple models and watermarking schemes show that TP and WN effectively eliminate watermarks, with WN maintaining high knowledge transfer efficiency and low computational overhead.  The authors also introduce a watermark stealing technique that doesn't require knowledge of the watermarking scheme's specifics.  Furthermore, they demonstrate that watermark collisions in multi-source distillation further weaken the effectiveness of current watermarking methods.  The paper concludes that current LLM watermarking techniques are insufficiently robust and highlights the urgent need for more resilient defense strategies.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the nascent field of LLM watermarking.  Its novelty lies in the systematic exploration of adversarial attacks against existing watermarking techniques.  The proposed watermark removal methods, particularly WN, are both effective and efficient, representing a substantial advancement in circumventing current protection mechanisms.  The discovery of watermark collisions in multi-source distillation scenarios reveals a previously unexplored weakness.  The detailed experiments and open-source code significantly enhance the paper's credibility and reproducibility.

However, some limitations exist. The evaluation focuses primarily on English language tasks and a limited set of models.  The reliance on n-gram based watermarking schemes might limit the generalizability of the findings to other watermarking paradigms.  The effectiveness of the watermark stealing technique against more sophisticated, adaptive watermarking schemes remains unclear.

Despite these limitations, the paper's thorough analysis and impactful results significantly advance the understanding of LLM watermarking vulnerabilities.  It raises crucial concerns about the current state of protection mechanisms and will likely spur further research into more robust watermarking and defense strategies. The implications for copyright protection and the responsible use of LLMs are substantial.

### DR.GAP: Mitigating Bias in Large Language Models using Gender-Aware Prompting with Demonstration and Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11603v1)
- **Authors**: Hongye Qiu, Yue Xu, Meikang Qiu, Wenjie Wang
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong natural language processing capabilities but also inherit and amplify societal biases, including gender bias, raising fairness concerns. Existing debiasing methods face significant limitations: parameter tuning requires access to model weights, prompt-based approaches often degrade model utility, and optimization-based techniques lack generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose DR.GAP (Demonstration and Reasoning for Gender-Aware Prompting), an automated and model-agnostic approach that mitigates gender bias while preserving model performance. DR.GAP selects bias-revealing examples and generates structured reasoning to guide models toward more impartial responses. Extensive experiments on coreference resolution and QA tasks across multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama3, and Llama2-Alpaca) demonstrate its effectiveness, generalization ability, and robustness. DR.GAP can generalize to vision-language models (VLMs), achieving significant bias reduction.
- **Summary**: DR.GAP is an automated, model-agnostic method for mitigating gender bias in Large Language Models (LLMs).  Unlike methods requiring model parameter access or those that degrade model performance, DR.GAP uses a multi-stage prompting strategy. It first selects bias-revealing examples (where a reference model succeeds but the target LLM fails). Then, it generates structured, gender-neutral reasoning using the reference model, incorporating verification, gender-independent filtering, and iterative refinement steps to ensure accuracy and fairness.  Experiments on coreference resolution and question answering tasks across multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, Llama 3, Llama 2-Alpaca) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate DR.GAP's effectiveness in reducing bias while preserving model utility.  The paper also includes an ablation study highlighting the importance of each module in the DR.GAP pipeline and analyzes its generalization capabilities across different datasets.

**Novelty and Significance:**

DR.GAP presents a novel approach to bias mitigation by focusing on generating gender-neutral reasoning within the prompt itself, rather than directly modifying model parameters or relying solely on simple prompt engineering techniques.  This approach addresses limitations of existing methods, offering a model-agnostic solution applicable to both open-source and black-box LLMs.  The multi-stage reasoning generation process, including verification, filtering, and refinement, is a significant methodological contribution, enhancing the robustness and reliability of the debiasing strategy.  The extension to VLMs further broadens the applicability and impact.

However, the paper's reliance on a high-performing reference model (GPT-4) for reasoning generation raises concerns about accessibility and potential bias amplification from the reference model itself. The focus on binary gender also limits its scope, neglecting the complexities of non-binary gender identities.  While the experimental results are promising, more extensive evaluation across diverse languages and datasets is needed to fully establish its generalizability and robustness.


**Score: 7**

**Rationale:**

The score of 7 reflects the paper's significant contribution to the field of LLM bias mitigation. The proposed DR.GAP method offers a novel approach with demonstrable effectiveness, addressing key limitations of existing techniques. The multi-stage reasoning generation process is a strong methodological advancement.  However, the reliance on a powerful reference model and the limitations regarding non-binary genders and linguistic diversity prevent a higher score.  Further research addressing these limitations would significantly enhance the impact and generalizability of DR.GAP, potentially pushing its score closer to a 9 or 10.

### GraphThought: Graph Combinatorial Optimization with Thought Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11607v1)
- **Authors**: Zixiao Huang, Lifeng Guo, Junjie Sheng, Haosheng Chen, Wenhao Li, Bo Jin, Changhong Lu, Xiangfeng Wang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, especially in text processing and generative tasks. Recent advancements in the reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as OpenAI-o1, have significantly broadened their applicability, particularly in complex problem-solving and logical inference. However, most existing LLMs struggle with notable limitations in handling graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems. To bridge this gap, we formally define the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem, including its state and action thought space. We then introduce a novel framework, GraphThought, designed to generate high-quality thought datasets for GCO problems. Leveraging these datasets, we fine-tune the Llama-3-8B-Instruct model to develop Llama-GT. Notably, despite its compact 8B-parameter architecture, Llama-GT matches the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs on the GraphArena benchmark. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms both proprietary and open-source models, even rivaling specialized models like o1-mini. This work sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark while challenging the prevailing notion that model scale is the primary driver of reasoning capability.
- **Summary**: GraphThought is a novel framework for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to graph combinatorial optimization (GCO) problems.  Existing LLMs struggle with GCO, which requires complex reasoning and search.  GraphThought addresses this by formally defining the Optimal Thoughts Design (OTD) problem and proposing a framework to generate high-quality training datasets for LLMs.  This involves "forward" and "backward" thought generation methods, using heuristic algorithms and solver-guided approaches respectively.  The fine-tuned Llama-GT model, based on Llama-3-8B-Instruct, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraphArena benchmark, rivaling even larger models, demonstrating that high-quality data, rather than sheer model size, is crucial for effective reasoning. The paper also explores automated dataset generation using LLMs, showing promising results but highlighting limitations in generating complex thought sequences.  The introduction of a generalized optimality ratio metric enhances evaluation capabilities.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

GraphThought presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM application in combinatorial optimization.  The core idea of generating structured "thoughts" as intermediate steps to guide the LLM towards a solution is a significant advancement over directly prompting the model for solutions. This is particularly evident in its strong empirical results surpassing other LLMs, even larger ones, on the GraphArena benchmark. The formalization of the OTD problem and the dual-process (forward/backward) MTP framework for thought generation add rigor and provide a systematic approach.  The exploration of automated dataset generation through LLM-driven code generation is a promising direction, although its current limitations are acknowledged.  The use of a generalized optimality ratio is a useful addition to the evaluation methodology.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on manual design of action and state thoughts in the initial stages limits the generalizability of the framework. While the automated approach is promising, its current performance is less impressive than the human-designed approach.  The paper mentions potential future improvements, particularly concerning the difficulty encountered in certain complex tasks like TSP, but lacks a deeper analysis of these limitations.  Furthermore, while the comparison with existing methods is thorough, a more detailed ablation study on individual components of the framework (e.g., impact of forward vs. backward thought generation) would strengthen the paper.


Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper's significant advancement in applying LLMs to a challenging problem domain, combined with the proposed framework's theoretical underpinnings and impressive empirical results, earns it a high score.

### Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion Policy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11612v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaoyi Dong, Jian Cheng, Xi Sheryl Zhang
- **Abstract**: The Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm with a Gaussian policy has become a mainstream implementation for realizing the Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) objective, which incorporates entropy maximization to encourage exploration and enhance policy robustness. While the Gaussian policy performs well on simpler tasks, its exploration capacity and potential performance in complex multi-goal RL environments are limited by its inherent unimodality. In this paper, we employ the diffusion model, a powerful generative model capable of capturing complex multimodal distributions, as the policy representation to fulfill the MaxEnt RL objective, developing a method named MaxEnt RL with Diffusion Policy (MaxEntDP). Our method enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Experimental results on Mujoco benchmarks show that MaxEntDP outperforms the Gaussian policy and other generative models within the MaxEnt RL framework, and performs comparably to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/diffusionyes/MaxEntDP.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces MaxEntDP, a maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL) algorithm that utilizes diffusion models as its policy representation.  The authors argue that the multimodal nature of diffusion models improves exploration compared to the commonly used Gaussian policy in standard MaxEnt RL algorithms like Soft Actor-Critic (SAC).  To integrate diffusion models into the SAC framework, they propose two key contributions:  a "Q-weighted Noise Estimation" method for training the diffusion model to approximate the exponential of the Q-function, and a numerical integration technique to approximate the log probability of the diffusion policy.  Experiments on MuJoCo benchmarks demonstrate that MaxEntDP outperforms SAC with a Gaussian policy and other generative model-based MaxEnt RL methods, achieving comparable performance to other state-of-the-art diffusion-based online RL algorithms.  The paper also includes ablation studies highlighting the benefits of the MaxEnt objective and the proposed training method.

**Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of MaxEnt RL, specifically addressing the limitations of unimodal policies in complex environments.  The use of diffusion models as a policy representation is a novel approach, offering a potentially significant improvement in exploration capabilities.  The proposed Q-weighted Noise Estimation method cleverly addresses the challenge of training a diffusion model without direct samples from the target distribution, leveraging the Q-function instead.  The numerical integration technique, while approximate, offers a practical solution to the inherent difficulty of computing log probabilities for diffusion models.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  The core idea of using more expressive generative models for policy representation in RL has been explored before, albeit often with different generative models or within different RL frameworks.  The specific contributions, while technically sound, are incremental advancements on existing techniques rather than a groundbreaking paradigm shift.  Furthermore, the comparative analysis is mainly focused on other diffusion-based online RL methods, and a more comprehensive comparison against a broader range of MaxEnt RL and general RL algorithms would strengthen the paper's claims.  The ablation studies are helpful but could be extended to better isolate the contributions of each component of the proposed method.

The potential impact of the work is positive.  MaxEntDP offers a promising approach for tackling challenging multi-goal RL problems. The improved exploration and robustness demonstrated in the experiments are encouraging.  However, the practical advantages need further investigation in more diverse and complex environments than those presented. The clear presentation of the algorithm and code availability are strengths that enhance reproducibility and wider adoption.

Score: 7

**Rationale:** The score reflects a solid contribution with noticeable advancements in MaxEnt RL. The use of diffusion models is novel within the specific context of MaxEnt RL and the proposed training methods are well-motivated and effective. However, the overall novelty isn't groundbreaking, and a more comprehensive experimental evaluation and a deeper comparison with existing non-diffusion based MaxEnt RL methods would be needed to justify a higher score. The incremental nature of the contributions and the relatively limited scope of the experiments prevent it from reaching a higher score.

- **Abstract**: Prior studies have shown that distinguishing text generated by large language models (LLMs) from human-written one is highly challenging, and often no better than random guessing. To verify the generalizability of this finding across languages and domains, we perform an extensive case study to identify the upper bound of human detection accuracy. Across 16 datasets covering 9 languages and 9 domains, 19 annotators achieved an average detection accuracy of 87.6%, thus challenging previous conclusions. We find that major gaps between human and machine text lie in concreteness, cultural nuances, and diversity. Prompting by explicitly explaining the distinctions in the prompts can partially bridge the gaps in over 50% of the cases. However, we also find that humans do not always prefer human-written text, particularly when they cannot clearly identify its source.
- **Summary**: This paper challenges the prevailing belief that humans cannot reliably distinguish between human-written and large language model (LLM)-generated text.  Through a large-scale multilingual study across 16 datasets (9 languages, 9 domains, 11 LLMs), 19 expert annotators achieved an average detection accuracy of 87.6%, significantly higher than previous findings.  Key differences identified were concreteness, cultural nuances, and diversity in text length, structure, and sentiment.  While prompting strategies partially improved LLM outputs, making detection more difficult (average accuracy dropping to 72.5%), cultural nuances remained a challenge.  Surprisingly, human preference for human-written text wasn't universal;  machine-generated text was often preferred, especially in Russian and Arabic, highlighting the complexity of aligning LLM outputs with human preferences. The authors release their data to facilitate future research.

Score: 8

Rationale: This paper makes a significant contribution by comprehensively challenging existing literature on human detection of LLM-generated text. The large-scale, multilingual nature of the study is a major strength, offering a much broader perspective than previous, largely English-centric work.  The finding that expert annotators can achieve high accuracy in detection is compelling and potentially impactful for applications requiring content authenticity verification. The exploration of prompting strategies and human preferences adds further depth and nuance to the understanding of the human-LLM text gap.

However, the reliance on expert annotators is a limitation; results may not generalize to the average user.  While the authors acknowledge this, a future study incorporating non-expert participants would strengthen the findings.  Furthermore, the analysis of distinguishable features could be more in-depth, potentially utilizing quantitative linguistic analyses beyond qualitative observations.  Despite these limitations, the paper's scale, methodology, and implications for the field justify a high score.

### Membership Inference Attacks for Face Images Against Fine-Tuned Latent Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11619v1)
- **Authors**: Lauritz Christian Holme, Anton Mosquera Storgaard, Siavash Arjomand Bigdeli
- **Abstract**: The rise of generative image models leads to privacy concerns when it comes to the huge datasets used to train such models. This paper investigates the possibility of inferring if a set of face images was used for fine-tuning a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). A Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method is presented for this task. Using generated auxiliary data for the training of the attack model leads to significantly better performance, and so does the use of watermarks. The guidance scale used for inference was found to have a significant influence. If a LDM is fine-tuned for long enough, the text prompt used for inference has no significant influence. The proposed MIA is found to be viable in a realistic black-box setup against LDMs fine-tuned on face-images.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates membership inference attacks (MIAs) against latent diffusion models (LDMs) fine-tuned on face images.  The authors demonstrate that it's feasible to determine if a set of face images was used in the fine-tuning process, even in a black-box setting where only the LDM's input-output functionality is accessible.  Their proposed MIA utilizes a ResNet-18 model trained on images generated by the target LDM (positives) and images from an auxiliary dataset (negatives). They find that using generated auxiliary data improves attack performance, as does the inclusion of watermarks in the training data.  The guidance scale used during image generation significantly impacts the attack's success rate.  Interestingly, after extensive fine-tuning, the text prompt used for inference has a less pronounced effect. The study highlights the vulnerability of fine-tuned LDMs to MIAs, particularly concerning the leakage of information from the fine-tuning dataset.  However, the attack's success is dataset-level, not individual image-level.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing body of work on the privacy implications of generative models.  However, its novelty and significance are somewhat limited.

**Strengths:**

* **Focus on Fine-Tuned LDMs:** The paper directly addresses the practical concern of fine-tuned models, a common scenario in real-world applications. This is a crucial distinction from many previous studies focusing solely on pre-trained models.
* **Black-Box Setting:** The attack operates under realistic black-box constraints, making its findings more applicable to real-world scenarios.
* **Systematic Evaluation:** The authors conduct multiple experiments to evaluate the impact of various factors, such as auxiliary data type, watermarks, and guidance scale.  This contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the attack's efficacy.
* **Practical Implications:** The results highlight the real privacy risks associated with training LDMs on sensitive data like face images, emphasizing the need for robust privacy-preserving techniques.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Generalizability:** The study focuses specifically on Stable Diffusion v1.5 fine-tuned on face images from two universities.  The generalizability to other LDMs, datasets, and image types is uncertain.  This significantly limits the broad impact of the findings.
* **Dataset-Level Inference:** The attack successfully infers dataset membership but struggles with individual image identification. This significantly reduces its practical impact for individuals concerned about their specific images being included.
* **Computational Cost:**  The requirement of training a generative shadow model to create the auxiliary dataset significantly increases the computational overhead of the attack, possibly hindering its widespread practical use.
* **Lack of Novel Attack Methodology:** While the application to fine-tuned LDMs is novel, the core attack methodology (using a classifier trained on generated data) is not fundamentally new.  The paper builds upon existing work on MIAs for generative models.


**Overall Score and Rationale:**

The paper contributes to the growing awareness of privacy risks associated with generative models, particularly in real-world fine-tuning scenarios. However, its limited generalizability, focus on dataset-level inference, and lack of completely novel methodology restrict its impact. The findings are valuable, but they do not represent a groundbreaking advancement in the field.  While important, it is essentially an incremental improvement and application of existing techniques.

### GaussianMotion: End-to-End Learning of Animatable Gaussian Avatars with Pose Guidance from Text
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11642v1)
- **Authors**: Gyumin Shim, Sangmin Lee, Jaegul Choo
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce GaussianMotion, a novel human rendering model that generates fully animatable scenes aligned with textual descriptions using Gaussian Splatting. Although existing methods achieve reasonable text-to-3D generation of human bodies using various 3D representations, they often face limitations in fidelity and efficiency, or primarily focus on static models with limited pose control. In contrast, our method generates fully animatable 3D avatars by combining deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting with text-to-3D score distillation, achieving high fidelity and efficient rendering for arbitrary poses. By densely generating diverse random poses during optimization, our deformable 3D human model learns to capture a wide range of natural motions distilled from a pose-conditioned diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose Adaptive Score Distillation that effectively balances realistic detail and smoothness to achieve optimal 3D results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines by producing high-quality textures in both static and animated results, and by generating diverse 3D human models from various textual inputs.
- **Summary**: GaussianMotion is a novel method for generating animatable 3D human avatars from text descriptions.  It leverages 3D Gaussian splatting for efficient rendering and combines it with a pose-aware score distillation technique derived from a pre-trained diffusion model.  A key innovation is the use of densely generated random poses during training, allowing the model to learn a wide range of natural motions.  The authors also introduce Adaptive Score Distillation, a method to balance realistic detail and smoothness in the generated avatars.  Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing text-to-3D human generation methods in terms of both static and animated avatar quality.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Combination of Techniques:** The paper effectively combines several existing techniques (3D Gaussian splatting, score distillation, ControlNet) in a novel way to address the limitations of existing text-to-3D human generation methods.  The integration of random pose generation during training for animatable avatars is particularly noteworthy.
* **Improved Score Distillation:** The proposed Adaptive Score Distillation (ASD) addresses a known limitation of naive score distillation sampling (SDS) â€“ the over-saturation problem â€“ by adaptively balancing the contributions of denoising and classifier scores. This is a significant contribution to the score distillation literature.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, comparing GaussianMotion to several state-of-the-art baselines.  A user study further strengthens the assessment of its performance.  Ablation studies help dissect the contributions of individual components.
* **Efficient Rendering:** The use of Gaussian splatting contributes to efficient rendering, a crucial aspect for real-world applications.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Dependence on Pre-trained Models:** GaussianMotion relies on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and a pose-conditioned ControlNet. While this is common practice in the field, it reduces the degree of end-to-end learning and increases dependence on external resources.
* **Limited Novelty in Individual Components:** While the combination is novel, the individual components (Gaussian splatting, score distillation, ControlNet) are not themselves groundbreaking. The paper's novelty primarily lies in their synergistic integration.
* **Potential for Improvement in Pose Control:** While the method demonstrates animatable avatars, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the limitations and potential improvements in pose control, especially for complex or unusual poses.


**Significance and Impact:**

GaussianMotion represents a solid advancement in text-to-3D human generation. The combination of techniques, the improved score distillation method, and the comprehensive evaluation contribute significantly to the field.  The ability to generate high-quality, animatable avatars from text opens up new possibilities in various applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and digital entertainment. However, the incremental nature of the individual components prevents it from being a truly revolutionary breakthrough.

Score: 8

**Rationale:**  GaussianMotion achieves a high score because it presents a significant improvement in the quality and efficiency of text-to-3D human generation.  The novel combination of techniques and the introduction of ASD are valuable contributions.  However, the score is not a 9 or 10 because the core components are not entirely new, and there's room for further work in refining pose control and reducing reliance on pre-trained models.  The paper's impact on the field will likely be substantial, prompting further research into similar synergistic combinations of existing techniques and improvements to score distillation.

### DELMAN: Dynamic Defense Against Large Language Model Jailbreaking with Model Editing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11647v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Wang, Fenghua Weng, Sibei Yang, Zhan Qin, Minlie Huang, Wenjie Wang
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in decision making, but their deployment is threatened by jailbreak attacks, where adversarial users manipulate model behavior to bypass safety measures. Existing defense mechanisms, such as safety fine-tuning and model editing, either require extensive parameter modifications or lack precision, leading to performance degradation on general tasks, which is unsuitable to post-deployment safety alignment. To address these challenges, we propose DELMAN (Dynamic Editing for LLMs JAilbreak DefeNse), a novel approach leveraging direct model editing for precise, dynamic protection against jailbreak attacks. DELMAN directly updates a minimal set of relevant parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving the model's utility. To avoid triggering a safe response in benign context, we incorporate KL-divergence regularization to ensure the updated model remains consistent with the original model when processing benign queries. Experimental results demonstrate that DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreak attacks while preserving the model's utility, and adapts seamlessly to new attack instances, providing a practical and efficient solution for post-deployment model protection.
- **Summary**: DELMAN is a novel approach to defending Large Language Models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks.  Unlike existing methods that rely on extensive retraining or imprecise modifications, DELMAN directly edits a minimal set of model parameters to neutralize harmful behaviors while preserving overall model utility.  It achieves this by identifying key representations of harmful tokens and associating them with safe responses, using KL-divergence regularization to prevent over-correction in benign contexts.  Experiments show DELMAN outperforms baseline methods in mitigating jailbreaks across various datasets and attack types, while maintaining or even improving performance on general tasks.  The method demonstrates adaptability to new attacks and the ability to perform successive edits without interfering with prior modifications. However, it relies on GPT-4 for preprocessing and its scalability to larger models and specialized domains remains to be fully investigated.


**Rigorous Rationale and Critical Evaluation:**

DELMAN presents a promising approach to a crucial problem â€“ robustly defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks in a post-deployment setting. The direct model editing approach, coupled with KL-divergence regularization for maintaining utility, is a significant advancement over existing methods that often compromise performance or require extensive retraining. The experimental results are comprehensive, showcasing the method's effectiveness across various datasets, attack types, and models. The consecutive edits experiment is particularly valuable in demonstrating the practicality of the approach in a dynamic threat environment.

However, the reliance on GPT-4 for preprocessing represents a significant limitation. This creates a dependency on an external, expensive model and raises questions about the overall efficiency and accessibility of DELMAN.  Furthermore, the scalability to larger models and its effectiveness in domain-specific LLMs remains unproven. While the paper acknowledges these limitations, more thorough investigation and mitigation strategies are needed before DELMAN can be considered a fully robust solution.  The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination of direct model editing and KL-divergence regularization applied to this problem, not necessarily in the individual components themselves.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, DELMAN represents a noteworthy contribution to the field, but its current limitations prevent it from being a transformative breakthrough.  The approach is promising and warrants further investigation, but its full potential remains to be realized.

### Uncovering the Impact of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Direct Preference Optimization: Lessons from Text-to-SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11656v1)
- **Authors**: Hanbing Liu, Haoyang Li, Xiaokang Zhang, Ruotong Chen, Haiyong Xu, Tian Tian, Qi Qi, Jing Zhang
- **Abstract**: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in complex reasoning tasks like math word problems and code generation. However, when applied to Text-to-SQL datasets, it often fails to improve performance and can even degrade it. Our investigation reveals the root cause: unlike math and code tasks, which naturally integrate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with DPO, Text-to-SQL datasets typically include only final answers (gold SQL queries) without detailed CoT solutions. By augmenting Text-to-SQL datasets with synthetic CoT solutions, we achieve, for the first time, consistent and significant performance improvements using DPO. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning is crucial for unlocking DPO's potential, as it mitigates reward hacking, strengthens discriminative capabilities, and improves scalability. These findings offer valuable insights for building more robust Text-to-SQL models. To support further research, we publicly release the code and CoT-enhanced datasets.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the effectiveness of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for improving Text-to-SQL models.  Unlike previous successful applications of DPO in tasks like math problem solving and code generation, the authors find that DPO often fails to improve, and sometimes even degrades, Text-to-SQL performance.  They attribute this to the lack of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning steps in typical Text-to-SQL datasets, which only provide the final SQL query as a label.  By augmenting a Text-to-SQL dataset (Bird) with synthetic CoT solutions generated by an LLM, they demonstrate significant and consistent performance improvements using DPO across various open-source LLMs.  Analysis reveals that CoT mitigates reward hacking, improves the discriminative power of DPO, and enhances its scalability.  The authors release their code and the CoT-enhanced datasets to facilitate further research.


**Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution by highlighting a crucial limitation of applying DPO directly to Text-to-SQL tasks. The finding that the presence or absence of CoT reasoning significantly impacts DPO's effectiveness is novel and insightful. The empirical evidence, using a range of LLMs and datasets, is strong.  The proposed solution of generating synthetic CoT data is practical and addresses a significant bottleneck in data creation for preference learning.  The detailed analysis of reward hacking and discriminative ability further strengthens the paper's contribution.

However, the reliance on a powerful, closed-source LLM (GPT-4) for CoT synthesis is a weakness.  While the authors justify this as a means to reduce annotation cost, it raises concerns about reproducibility and generalizability. The impact on the simpler Spider dataset is less pronounced, suggesting potential limitations in the general applicability of their findings.  The paper also focuses heavily on execution accuracy, which can be a flawed metric in Text-to-SQL, as discussed in the paper itself.  While the improvements are notable, it would have been beneficial to also analyze other qualitative aspects of generated SQL queries.

Despite these limitations, the paper's findings are significant. It advances our understanding of the interplay between DPO, CoT reasoning, and data quality in complex language tasks. Its practical contribution of the CoT-enhanced datasets and readily available code will likely influence future research on Text-to-SQL and preference optimization.

### An Innovative Brain-Computer Interface Interaction System Based on the Large Language Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11659v1)
- **Authors**: Jing Jina, Yutao Zhang, Ruitian Xu, Yixin Chen
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) provide a more effective pathway for upgrading brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in terms of user interaction. The widespread adoption of BCIs in daily application scenarios is still limited by factors such as their single functionality, restricted paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low levels of intelligence. In this paper, we propose an innovative BCI system that deeply integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with an LLM application programming interface (API). It allows natural language input through the SSVEP speller and dynamically calls large models to generate SSVEP paradigms. The command prompt, blinking frequency, and layout position are adjustable to meet the user's control requirements in various scenarios. More than ten languages are compatible with the multilingual support of LLM. A variety of task scenarios, such as home appliance control, robotic arm operation, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) management are provided. The task interfaces of the system can be personalized according to the user's habits, usage scenarios, and equipment characteristics. By combining the SSVEP speller with an LLM, the system solves numerous challenges faced by current BCI systems and makes breakthroughs in functionality, intelligence, and multilingual support. The introduction of LLM not only enhances user experience but also expands the potential applications of BCI technology in real-world environments.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) system that integrates a steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) speller with a large language model (LLM) API.  The system addresses limitations of current BCI systems, namely limited functionality, inflexible paradigm design, weak multilingual support, and low intelligence.  The LLM dynamically generates SSVEP paradigms based on user commands (input via the SSVEP speller), allowing for personalized interfaces across multiple languages and diverse applications (home appliance control, robotic arm operation, UAV management).  The system uses Task-Discriminant Component Analysis (TDCA) for EEG signal processing.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful integration of existing technologies.  The core idea â€“ using an LLM to dynamically generate BCI interfaces â€“ is novel in the context of SSVEP-based BCIs.  This addresses a major limitation of current systems: their inflexibility.  The multilingual support, enabled by the LLM, further broadens the potential user base and applications.  The inclusion of multiple application scenarios (home appliances, robotics, UAVs) demonstrates the system's versatility.

However, several weaknesses warrant criticism:

* **Lack of rigorous evaluation:** The paper lacks detailed experimental results and statistical analysis to validate the system's performance.  Claims about accuracy, speed, and user experience are largely unsubstantiated. Figures are present but lack detailed explanations and don't provide sufficient quantitative data.  The absence of a control group (comparing performance with a traditional SSVEP system) weakens the evidence for the LLM's effectiveness.
* **Technical details are incomplete:** While the paper outlines the TDCA method, it simplifies the explanation and doesn't delve into crucial implementation details or potential challenges.  Similarly, the integration with different devices (robotic arm, UAV) lacks specifics about the communication protocols and control algorithms.
* **Overly optimistic claims:** The paper makes strong claims about breakthroughs and significant contributions without robust evidence.  While the concept is promising, the presented results do not sufficiently support these assertions.
* **Ethical considerations:** The paper does not discuss the ethical implications of such a system, especially concerning privacy and potential misuse.

Despite its innovative core concept, the lack of thorough evaluation and detailed technical explanation significantly limits the paper's impact.  The presented work represents a proof-of-concept rather than a fully validated and robust system.  Further research and a more rigorous evaluation are needed to solidify the claims made.

Score: 6

**Rationale:** The score reflects the novelty of the core idea (using LLMs for dynamic BCI interface generation), the potential for significant impact if fully realized, and the inclusion of multilingual support and diverse applications. However, the significant shortcomings in experimental validation, incomplete technical details, and overly optimistic claims prevent a higher score.  A more rigorous study with thorough quantitative evaluation and a detailed discussion of limitations and ethical concerns is necessary to demonstrate the true significance of this approach.

### VRoPE: Rotary Position Embedding for Video Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11664v1)
- **Authors**: Zikang Liu, Longteng Guo, Yepeng Tang, Junxian Cai, Kai Ma, Xi Chen, Jing Liu
- **Abstract**: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has shown strong performance in text-based Large Language Models (LLMs), but extending it to video remains a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal structure of video frames. Existing adaptations, such as RoPE-3D, attempt to encode spatial and temporal dimensions separately but suffer from two major limitations: positional bias in attention distribution and disruptions in video-text transitions. To overcome these issues, we propose Video Rotary Position Embedding (VRoPE), a novel positional encoding method tailored for Video-LLMs. Our approach restructures positional indices to preserve spatial coherence and ensure a smooth transition between video and text tokens. Additionally, we introduce a more balanced encoding strategy that mitigates attention biases, ensuring a more uniform distribution of spatial focus. Extensive experiments on Vicuna and Qwen2 across different model scales demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants, achieving significant improvements in video understanding, temporal reasoning, and retrieval tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/johncaged/VRoPE
- **Summary**: This paper introduces VRoPE, a novel positional encoding method for Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs).  Existing methods like RoPE-3D, which adapt Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for video, suffer from positional bias in attention and discontinuous video-text transitions. VRoPE addresses these issues by restructuring positional indices to maintain spatial coherence and smooth transitions, and by using a symmetric encoding strategy to mitigate attention bias.  Experiments on Vicuna and Qwen2 models demonstrate that VRoPE consistently outperforms previous RoPE variants on various video understanding tasks, including temporal reasoning and retrieval.  The authors provide ablation studies to support the effectiveness of their proposed method.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of Video-LLMs, focusing on a crucial yet often overlooked aspect: positional encoding.  The identified limitations of existing RoPE adaptations are well-justified, and the proposed VRoPE offers a compelling solution. The approach is elegantly designed, addressing both positional bias and the discontinuity problem during video-text transitions.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the superiority of VRoPE across diverse benchmarks and model sizes. The ablation studies further solidify the claims by isolating the contributions of the key components.  The inclusion of long video retrieval experiments highlights the generalization capabilities of the proposed method.

However, some limitations exist.  The experiments are limited to models with up to 7B parameters, preventing a comprehensive assessment of scalability to larger models.  The claim of "cost-free" improvement should be critically examined, as even though no new parameters are added, the computational cost of the encoding itself may increase slightly. While the paper mentions adaptability to other modalities, this is not fully explored.

Despite these minor limitations, the paper makes a significant contribution to the state-of-the-art in Video-LLM positional encoding.  The proposed VRoPE offers a practical and effective solution to a crucial problem, with strong empirical evidence supporting its effectiveness. The code release further enhances its impact.

- **Abstract**: Data augmentation is an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) for enriching training datasets by generating diverse samples. This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: \textit{Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity}. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a \textbf{\underline{D}}iversity-\textbf{\underline{o}}riented data \textbf{\underline{Aug}}mentation framework (\textbf{DoAug}). % \(\mathscr{DoAug}\) Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train an LLM as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of \(10.52\%\), surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces DoAug, a diversity-oriented data augmentation framework for NLP.  DoAug leverages a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned as a paraphraser.  This paraphraser, further refined using a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach (DPO) and a coreset selection method, generates diverse paraphrases of key dataset samples. These paraphrases are integrated with the original data to create a more diverse training dataset. Experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that DoAug significantly improves dataset diversity while maintaining label consistency, leading to an average performance gain of 10.52% on downstream tasks.  The paper highlights the often-neglected aspect of diversity in data augmentation and proposes a novel method to address it.


**Critical Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of data augmentation in NLP.  The core idea of explicitly focusing on diversity during augmentation is important and under-explored. The use of an LLM and the DPO algorithm for generating diverse, yet semantically similar, paraphrases represents a methodological advancement over simpler augmentation techniques. The extensive experimentation across 12 datasets strengthens the findings. The ablation studies further support the effectiveness of the proposed framework's individual components.  The exploration of different LLM architectures adds to the paper's robustness.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on multiple diversity metrics, without a clear justification for their selection, could be seen as a potential over-engineering approach. While the paper acknowledges limitations in diversity measurement and data validation, addressing these would significantly enhance the paper's impact. The discussion of potential LLM risks (bias and hallucinations) is brief and lacks concrete mitigation strategies. Finally, the paper focuses primarily on sentence classification tasks; demonstrating effectiveness in other NLP tasks would broaden its applicability and strengthen its claim of generality.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper demonstrates significant novelty and impact within the context of data augmentation for NLP. The focus on diversity and the proposed methodology offer a valuable contribution. However, the limitations concerning evaluation and generalizability prevent it from being a truly exceptional contribution.

### Towards Fully Exploiting LLM Internal States to Enhance Knowledge Boundary Perception
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11677v1)
- **Authors**: Shiyu Ni, Keping Bi, Jiafeng Guo, Lulu Yu, Baolong Bi, Xueqi Cheng
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance across diverse tasks but often struggle to accurately gauge their knowledge boundaries, leading to confident yet incorrect responses. This paper explores leveraging LLMs' internal states to enhance their perception of knowledge boundaries from efficiency and risk perspectives. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate their confidence using internal states before response generation, potentially saving computational resources. Our experiments on datasets like Natural Questions, HotpotQA, and MMLU reveal that LLMs demonstrate significant pre-generation perception, which is further refined post-generation, with perception gaps remaining stable across varying conditions. To mitigate risks in critical domains, we introduce Consistency-based Confidence Calibration ($C^3$), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation. $C^3$ significantly improves LLMs' ability to recognize their knowledge gaps, enhancing the unknown perception rate by 5.6\% on NQ and 4.9\% on HotpotQA. Our findings suggest that pre-generation confidence estimation can optimize efficiency, while $C^3$ effectively controls output risks, advancing the reliability of LLMs in practical applications.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) knowledge boundary perception by leveraging internal states.  The authors explore whether LLMs can estimate their confidence *before* generating a response, thus improving efficiency.  Experiments on NQ, HotpotQA, and MMLU datasets show LLMs possess significant pre-generation confidence perception, further refined post-generation, with the perception gap remaining stable across various conditions.  To mitigate risks, they introduce Consistency-based Confidence Calibration (C3), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation. C3 significantly improves the unknown perception rate (by 5.6% on NQ and 4.9% on HotpotQA).  The study concludes that pre-generation confidence estimation optimizes efficiency, while C3 effectively controls output risks, increasing LLM reliability.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of LLM reliability and safety.  The investigation into pre-generation confidence estimation offers a novel approach to improving efficiency, a crucial aspect often overlooked in favour of accuracy-focused methods.  The proposed C3 method is also a noteworthy contribution, offering a practical technique for calibrating confidence based on question consistency, a human-inspired approach that enhances the detection of LLM knowledge gaps.  The use of multiple datasets and LLMs strengthens the generalizability of the findings.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on a binary confidence assessment limits the granularity of the analysis. A more nuanced approach to confidence levels might provide richer insights.  The study focuses on factual knowledge; the application to other types of knowledge requires further research.  The relatively small-scale experiments (7B and 13B models) limit the generalizability to larger models.

Despite these limitations, the paper's contributions are significant.  The focus on efficiency and risk mitigation addresses critical practical challenges in deploying LLMs. The proposed methods demonstrate tangible improvements, offering valuable strategies for enhancing LLM trustworthiness. The paper likely will influence future research in LLM reliability and inspire further work on pre-generation confidence estimation and more sophisticated calibration techniques.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11678v1)
- **Authors**: Haoxuan Li, Jifan Yu, Xin Cong, Yang Dang, Yisi Zhan, Huiqin Liu, Zhiyuan Liu
- **Abstract**: Metacognitive education plays a crucial role in cultivating students' self-regulation and reflective thinking, providing essential support for those with learning difficulties through academic advising. Simulating students with insufficient learning capabilities using large language models offers a promising approach to refining pedagogical methods without ethical concerns. However, existing simulations often fail to authentically represent students' learning struggles and face challenges in evaluation due to the lack of reliable metrics and ethical constraints in data collection. To address these issues, we propose a pipeline for automatically generating and filtering high-quality simulated student agents. Our approach leverages a two-round automated scoring system validated by human experts and employs a score propagation module to obtain more consistent scores across the student graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our pipeline efficiently identifies high-quality student agents, and we discuss the traits that influence the simulation's effectiveness. By simulating students with varying degrees of learning difficulties, our work paves the way for broader applications in personalized learning and educational assessment.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a pipeline for automatically generating and evaluating high-quality simulated student agents using Large Language Models (LLMs).  The goal is to create realistic simulations of students with varying learning difficulties for use in developing and testing pedagogical methods, avoiding the ethical concerns associated with using real students.  The pipeline involves generating random student profiles, then employing a two-round automated scoring system (assessing profile and behavioral consistency) partially validated by human experts. A graph neural network propagates scores across a graph of similar student profiles, improving consistency.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the pipeline in identifying high-quality agents, highlighting the influence of various profile traits on the simulation's realism. The limitations of the approach, including its reliance on prompt-based LLMs and potential biases in the training data, are also discussed.

### RIDE: Enhancing Large Language Model Alignment through Restyled In-Context Learning Demonstration Exemplars
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11681v1)
- **Authors**: Yuncheng Hua, Lizhen Qu, Zhuang Li, Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim, Gholamreza Haffari
- **Abstract**: Alignment tuning is crucial for ensuring large language models (LLMs) behave ethically and helpfully. Current alignment approaches require high-quality annotations and significant training resources. This paper proposes a low-cost, tuning-free method using in-context learning (ICL) to enhance LLM alignment. Through an analysis of high-quality ICL demos, we identified style as a key factor influencing LLM alignment capabilities and explicitly restyled ICL exemplars based on this stylistic framework. Additionally, we combined the restyled demos to achieve a balance between the two conflicting aspects of LLM alignment--factuality and safety. We packaged the restyled examples as prompts to trigger few-shot learning, improving LLM alignment. Compared to the best baseline approach, with an average score of 5.00 as the maximum, our method achieves a maximum 0.10 increase on the Alpaca task (from 4.50 to 4.60), a 0.22 enhancement on the Just-eval benchmark (from 4.34 to 4.56), and a maximum improvement of 0.32 (from 3.53 to 3.85) on the MT-Bench dataset. We release the code and data at https://github.com/AnonymousCode-ComputerScience/RIDE.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes RIDE (Restyled In-context Learning Demonstration Exemplars), a tuning-free method to improve Large Language Model (LLM) alignment.  Instead of costly fine-tuning, RIDE analyzes the style of high-quality in-context learning (ICL) examples and automatically restyles them using an LLM.  The restyling focuses on four key stylistic features identified as improving alignment: lengthy responses, human-like tone, three-part structuring, and a "refuse-while-providing-knowledge" style for safety-related queries.  Different combinations of restyled exemplars are explored to balance factuality and safety. Experiments on Alpaca-eval, just-eval-instruct, and MT-Bench show improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in balancing safety and helpfulness.  The authors also demonstrate that a base LLM using RIDE can outperform its instruction-tuned counterpart.  The paper acknowledges limitations such as reliance on an LLM-as-a-judge and the limited scope of ICL demonstrations.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

Score: 7

**Rationale:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:** The focus on automatically restyling ICL examples to improve alignment is a novel approach, moving beyond simple selection of exemplars.  The identification of key stylistic features and their impact on alignment is a valuable contribution.
* **Practical Significance:** The tuning-free nature of RIDE is highly appealing, offering a low-cost alternative to resource-intensive fine-tuning methods.  The plug-and-play aspect makes it easily applicable to different LLMs.
* **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents results across multiple benchmarks and LLMs, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of RIDE.  The comparison to state-of-the-art methods further strengthens the findings.
* **Addressing a Key Problem:** The work directly addresses the crucial challenge of LLM alignment, a critical issue for responsible AI development.  The focus on balancing factuality and safety is particularly relevant.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Generalizability:** The reliance on a specific set of ICL examples and the LLM used for restyling raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. Further testing with more diverse datasets and restyling LLMs is needed.
* **LLM-as-a-Judge Bias:** The use of an LLM as a judge introduces potential bias, as the evaluation metric itself is influenced by the LLM's own biases and capabilities.  Human evaluation would significantly enhance the reliability of the results.
* **Methodological Details:** While the paper outlines the approach, some aspects of the hierarchical traversal algorithm and the restyling process lack detailed explanation, potentially limiting reproducibility.
* **Modest Performance Gains:** While improvements are reported, the magnitude of the gains is relatively modest.  Larger improvements might be expected given the sophistication of the proposed method.


**Potential Influence:**

RIDE's tuning-free and plug-and-play nature could make it an attractive option for researchers and practitioners working with LLMs, especially those with limited resources. The focus on stylistic features and their impact on alignment could also inspire further research in this direction. However, the limitations need to be addressed to ensure broader adoption and avoid overstating the impact.  The paper represents a solid step forward but requires further validation and refinement before becoming a widely adopted technique.

### MathFimer: Enhancing Mathematical Reasoning by Expanding Reasoning Steps through Fill-in-the-Middle Task
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11684v1)
- **Authors**: Yuchen Yan, Yongliang Shen, Yang Liu, Jin Jiang, Xin Xu, Mengdi Zhang, Jian Shao, Yueting Zhuang
- **Abstract**: Mathematical reasoning represents a critical frontier in advancing large language models (LLMs). While step-by-step approaches have emerged as the dominant paradigm for mathematical problem-solving in LLMs, the quality of reasoning steps in training data fundamentally constrains the performance of the models. Recent studies has demonstrated that more detailed intermediate steps can enhance model performance, yet existing methods for step expansion either require more powerful external models or incur substantial computational costs. In this paper, we introduce MathFimer, a novel framework for mathematical reasoning step expansion inspired by the "Fill-in-the-middle" task from code completion. By decomposing solution chains into prefix-suffix pairs and training models to reconstruct missing intermediate steps, we develop a specialized model, MathFimer-7B, on our carefully curated NuminaMath-FIM dataset. We then apply these models to enhance existing mathematical reasoning datasets by inserting detailed intermediate steps into their solution chains, creating MathFimer-expanded versions. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning datasets, including MathInstruct, MetaMathQA and etc., we demonstrate that models trained on MathFimer-expanded data consistently outperform their counterparts trained on original data across various benchmarks such as GSM8K and MATH. Our approach offers a practical, scalable solution for enhancing mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs without relying on powerful external models or expensive inference procedures.
- **Summary**: MathFimer is a novel framework for improving large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning abilities by expanding the reasoning steps within existing solutions.  Instead of generating entirely new solutions, it leverages a "Fill-in-the-Middle" (FIM) approach, inspired by code completion techniques.  The method decomposes existing step-by-step solutions into prefix-suffix pairs, training a model (MathFimer-7B) to reconstruct missing intermediate steps. This model is then used to expand the steps in various mathematical reasoning datasets, creating "MathFimer-expanded" versions.  Experiments show that models trained on this expanded data consistently outperform those trained on the original data across several benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, etc.).  The authors highlight the scalability and efficiency of their approach compared to methods relying on powerful external models or computationally expensive search algorithms.  They also conduct ablation studies to separate the effects of their method from knowledge transfer from the base model.  Iterative application of MathFimer further enhances performance.  While showing promise, the paper acknowledges limitations in domain generalization and the potential for error propagation during step generation.


**Rigorous Rationale and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM mathematical reasoning.  The core idea of using an FIM approach to expand reasoning steps is novel and addresses a key limitation of existing methods: the reliance on computationally expensive or large model-based techniques. The empirical results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach across various datasets and model sizes.  The ablation studies contribute to a better understanding of the method's impact, separating it from simple knowledge transfer. The iterative application and scalability analysis are also important contributions.

However, the paper's limitations also need to be acknowledged.  The reliance on pre-existing, high-quality step-by-step solutions limits its applicability to scenarios where such data is scarce.  The potential for error propagation during step generation and the lack of robust verification mechanisms are significant concerns. While the paper addresses domain generalization as a limitation, more evidence is needed to confirm its applicability outside of mathematics.  The discussion of the impact of model scale is limited. While the results show a modest impact on the improvement when using larger models, there is not a discussion of cost vs. benefit of scaling.

Considering the novelty of the FIM approach for step expansion, its empirical validation, the included ablation studies, and the iterative application and scalability analysis, the paper deserves a high score.  However, the limitations regarding error propagation and domain generalization prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

### Improve LLM-as-a-Judge Ability as a General Ability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11689v1)
- **Authors**: Jiachen Yu, Shaoning Sun, Xiaohui Hu, Jiaxu Yan, Kaidong Yu, Xuelong Li
- **Abstract**: LLM-as-a-Judge leverages the generative and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to evaluate LLM responses across diverse scenarios, providing accurate preference signals. This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human values, ensuring ethical and reliable AI outputs that align with societal norms. Recent studies have raised many methods to train LLM as generative judges, but most of them are data consuming or lack accuracy, and only focus on LLM's judge ability. In this work, we regard judge ability as a general ability of LLM and implement a two-stage training approach, comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up and direct preference optimization (DPO) enhancement, to achieve judge style adaptation and improve judgment accuracy. Additionally, we introduce an efficient data synthesis method to generate judgmental content. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, utilizing only about 2% to 40% of the data required by other methods, achieves SOTA performance on RewardBench. Furthermore, our training method enhances the general capabilities of the model by constructing complicated judge task, and the judge signals provided by our model have significantly enhanced the downstream DPO training performance of our internal models in our test to optimize policy model with Judge Model. We also open-source our model weights and training data to facilitate further research.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes RISE-Judge, a novel two-stage training framework for Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-judge applications.  The framework comprises Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) warm-up, focusing on style adaptation and judgment format learning, followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) enhancement to improve judgment accuracy.  A key contribution is an efficient data synthesis method, requiring significantly less data (2-40%) than existing approaches.  Experiments on RewardBench demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.  Furthermore, the paper argues and shows that improving LLM judgment capabilities also enhances general abilities, as evidenced by comparable performance to instruction-tuned models on general chat benchmarks.  Finally, downstream DPO experiments using RISE-Judge to annotate preferences for a policy model show improved performance over GPT-4o annotations. The model weights and training data are open-sourced.


**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes several contributions, but their novelty and impact need critical assessment.  The two-stage training approach (SFT followed by DPO) is not entirely novel; many works use similar techniques. However, the specific combination and the focus on efficient data synthesis through a carefully designed prompt rewriting system are noteworthy.  The open-sourcing of the data and model weights significantly contributes to the reproducibility and fosters further research. The claim of improved *general* ability due to improved judging ability is interesting but requires more extensive benchmarking across diverse tasks to be fully convincing.  The current evidence, while positive, is limited. The demonstration of improved downstream performance in policy model training is a significant practical contribution, showcasing the real-world utility of the proposed method.

However, the paper's methodology heavily relies on GPT-4o for data generation and evaluation, raising concerns about the inherent biases and limitations of this model. The reliance on a proprietary model limits the generalizability and applicability of the method.  The paper also lacks a thorough comparison with other recent, similar works on efficient reward model training, potentially underselling the incremental novelty of its contributions.


Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field but falls short of being a groundbreaking advancement. The efficient data synthesis technique and the demonstrated improved downstream performance are strong points, while the limited novelty of the core training approach and the reliance on GPT-4o temper the overall impact.

### MVTokenFlow: High-quality 4D Content Generation using Multiview Token Flow
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11697v1)
- **Authors**: Hanzhuo Huang, Yuan Liu, Ge Zheng, Jiepeng Wang, Zhiyang Dou, Sibei Yang
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we present MVTokenFlow for high-quality 4D content creation from monocular videos. Recent advancements in generative models such as video diffusion models and multiview diffusion models enable us to create videos or 3D models. However, extending these generative models for dynamic 4D content creation is still a challenging task that requires the generated content to be consistent spatially and temporally. To address this challenge, MVTokenFlow utilizes the multiview diffusion model to generate multiview images on different timesteps, which attains spatial consistency across different viewpoints and allows us to reconstruct a reasonable coarse 4D field. Then, MVTokenFlow further regenerates all the multiview images using the rendered 2D flows as guidance. The 2D flows effectively associate pixels from different timesteps and improve the temporal consistency by reusing tokens in the regeneration process. Finally, the regenerated images are spatiotemporally consistent and utilized to refine the coarse 4D field to get a high-quality 4D field. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and show significantly improved quality than baseline methods.
- **Summary**: MVTokenFlow is a novel method for high-quality 4D content generation from monocular videos.  It addresses the challenge of maintaining both spatial and temporal consistency in generated multi-view videos. The approach uses a two-stage process:  a coarse stage employing a multi-view diffusion model (Era3D) to generate initial multi-view images, followed by a refinement stage.  This refinement leverages rendered 2D flows from the coarse 4D representation to guide the regeneration of multi-view images, improving temporal consistency via a token flow technique. The refined images then improve the initial 4D representation (a dynamic 3D Gaussian field). Experiments demonstrate superior results compared to existing methods, particularly in temporal consistency and overall quality.

**Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of 4D content generation.  The two-stage pipeline, combining multi-view diffusion with a novel token flow refinement based on rendered 2D flows, is a significant advancement. The use of a dynamic 3D Gaussian field representation offers efficiency advantages over NeRF-based approaches.  The ablation studies provide reasonable support for the effectiveness of the proposed components.  The improved results on both synthetic and real-world datasets are compelling.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model (Era3D) limits the method's generality; the performance is inherently bound by the capabilities of Era3D. The paper does acknowledge limitations in handling complex objects and uncommon viewpoints, which are crucial aspects for broader applicability.  Further, while the quantitative results are positive, more detailed analysis and comparisons across a wider range of metrics might strengthen the claims.  Finally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the computational cost and scalability of the proposed method.

Despite these weaknesses, the innovative combination of multi-view diffusion, 2D flow guidance, and token flow for refinement represents a notable advancement in 4D content generation. The improvements in temporal consistency are particularly significant. The potential impact on AR/VR, video generation, and robotics is considerable, making this a valuable contribution to the field.

- **Authors**: Guangya Yu, Yanhao Li, Zongying Jiang, Yuxiong Jin, Li Dai, Yupian Lin, Ruihui Hou, Weiyan Zhang, Yongqi Fan, Qi Ye, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan
- **Abstract**: Medical quality control indicators are essential to assess the qualifications of healthcare institutions for medical services. With the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in the medical field, leveraging these technologies for the Medical Quality Control Indicator Calculation (MQCIC) presents a promising approach. In this work, (1) we introduce a real-world task MQCIC and propose an open-source Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs)-based dataset (CMQCIC-Bench) comprising 785 instances and 76 indicators. (2) We propose a semi-automatic method to enhance the rule representation. Then we propose the Clinical Facts-based Inferential Rule (CF-IR) method that disentangles the clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning actions. (3) We conduct comprehensive experiments on 20 representative LLMs, covering general and medical models. Our findings reveal that CF-IR outperforms Chain-of-Thought methods in MQCIC tasks. (4) We conduct an error analysis and investigate the capabilities of clinical fact verification and inferential rule reasoning, providing insights to improve performance in the MQCIC further. The dataset and code is available in this repo https://anonymous.4open.science/r/C-MQCIC-1151.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces CMQCIC-Bench, a new Chinese benchmark dataset for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the task of Medical Quality Control Indicator Calculation (MQCIC).  MQCIC involves extracting information from electronic medical records (EMRs) to calculate quality metrics. The authors propose a new method, Clinical Facts-based Inferential Rule (CF-IR), which separates clinical fact verification from inferential rule reasoning.  Experiments on 20 LLMs show CF-IR outperforms Chain-of-Thought prompting, particularly in one-shot settings.  The paper also includes error analysis and an investigation of the individual capabilities of fact verification and rule reasoning.  The CMQCIC-Bench dataset and code are publicly available.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation in healthcare, but its novelty and significance are not groundbreaking.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Dataset and Task:** The creation of CMQCIC-Bench addresses a real-world clinical need, providing a valuable resource for future research. The MQCIC task itself is novel and relevant to healthcare quality assessment.
* **Methodological Contribution:** The CF-IR method offers a potentially useful approach to improve LLM performance on complex reasoning tasks by disentangling fact verification and inference.  The semi-automatic rule enhancement process is also a practical contribution.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper evaluates a wide range of LLMs (both general and medical), using multiple prompting methods and metrics.  The error analysis provides valuable insights.
* **Open-Source Contribution:** Making the dataset and code publicly available significantly enhances the reproducibility and impact of the work.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Dataset Size:** The dataset, with only 785 instances, is relatively small, especially considering the complexity of the task and the variability across medical indicators.  This limits the generalizability of the findings.
* **Language Bias:** The focus on Chinese EMRs and LLMs restricts the applicability of the benchmark to other languages and healthcare systems.
* **Overreliance on GPT-4:** The use of GPT-4 for data annotation and rule enhancement introduces a potential bias and limits the independence of the evaluation.
* **Incremental Improvement:** While CF-IR shows improvement over CoT, the magnitude of the improvement is modest (0.43% zero-shot, 1.45% one-shot). This suggests that the approach, while useful, may not be a revolutionary solution.
* **Lack of comparison with other relevant benchmarks:** The paper does not sufficiently address the relationship between its proposed benchmark and other existing benchmarks designed for similar tasks in clinical NLP.


**Overall Significance:**

The paper's contribution is significant but not transformative.  The new dataset and task are valuable additions to the field, and the CF-IR method offers a promising approach, although its improvements are incremental. The limitations regarding dataset size and language bias need to be acknowledged.  The paper will likely influence future research in LLM evaluation for medical applications, but it's unlikely to fundamentally reshape the field.

### LLM Agents Making Agent Tools
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11705v1)
- **Authors**: Georg WÃ¶lflein, Dyke Ferber, Daniel Truhn, Ognjen ArandjeloviÄ‡, Jakob Nikolas Kather
- **Abstract**: Tool use has turned large language models (LLMs) into powerful agents that can perform complex multi-step tasks by dynamically utilising external software components. However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains which demand large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, a novel agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a short task description and a repository URL, ToolMaker autonomously installs required dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism to iteratively diagnose and rectify errors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 diverse and complex computational tasks spanning both medical and non-medical domains with over 100 unit tests to objectively assess tool correctness and robustness. ToolMaker correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents. ToolMaker therefore is a step towards fully autonomous agent-based scientific workflows.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces TOOLMAKER, an agentic framework that autonomously creates Large Language Model (LLM)-compatible tools from scientific papers and their associated code repositories.  Unlike previous methods that build tools from scratch, TOOLMAKER leverages existing, publicly available code, reducing the need for human intervention in tool development.  The framework uses a closed-loop self-correction mechanism to iteratively identify and fix errors.  Evaluated on a new benchmark (TM-BENCH) containing 15 diverse tasks with over 100 unit tests, TOOLMAKER achieved 80% accuracy, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art software engineering agent, OpenHands.  The code and benchmark are publicly available.


Score: 8

Rationale:

**Strengths:**

* **Significant Advance in Agentic Systems:** TOOLMAKER addresses a crucial limitation of current LLM agents: their reliance on pre-built tools.  Automating tool creation from readily available scientific code represents a significant step towards more autonomous and adaptable AI agents. The 80% accuracy on a diverse benchmark is impressive.
* **Novel Methodology:** The closed-loop self-correction is a valuable contribution, improving the robustness and reliability of the generated tools. The use of Docker for reproducible environments is a practical and well-considered choice.
* **Public Availability:** The release of both the TOOLMAKER code and the TM-BENCH benchmark facilitates reproducibility and encourages further research in this area.  This fosters collaboration and advancement within the field.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Benchmark Limitations:** While TM-BENCH is a valuable contribution, its size (15 tasks) is relatively modest compared to some established software engineering benchmarks.  The generalizability of TOOLMAKER to a broader range of tasks and repositories with varying levels of documentation and quality remains to be fully demonstrated.
* **Dependence on Well-Structured Repositories:** TOOLMAKER's success hinges on the quality and structure of the input code repositories.  It struggles with poorly documented or poorly structured repositories, a common issue in open-source projects.
* **Ethical Considerations:** The paper rightly acknowledges the potential risks associated with autonomously creating complex scientific tools, particularly in life sciences. While acknowledged, a deeper discussion of mitigation strategies and responsible AI development would strengthen the paper.


Overall, TOOLMAKER demonstrates a promising approach to agentic tool creation.  The high accuracy on a diverse (although limited) benchmark, coupled with the public release of the code and benchmark, justifies a high score. However, the limitations regarding benchmark scope, reliance on well-structured repositories, and the relatively brief discussion of ethical considerations prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

### Ad-hoc Concept Forming in the Game Codenames as a Means for Evaluating Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11707v1)
- **Authors**: Sherzod Hakimov, Lara Pfennigschmidt, David Schlangen
- **Abstract**: This study utilizes the game Codenames as a benchmarking tool to evaluate large language models (LLMs) with respect to specific linguistic and cognitive skills. LLMs play each side of the game, where one side generates a clue word covering several target words and the other guesses those target words. We designed various experiments by controlling the choice of words (abstract vs. concrete words, ambiguous vs. monosemic) or the opponent (programmed to be faster or slower in revealing words). Recent commercial and open-weight models were compared side-by-side to find out factors affecting their performance. The evaluation reveals details about their strategies, challenging cases, and limitations of LLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces a novel method for evaluating large language models (LLMs) using the board game Codenames.  The authors have LLMs play both roles in the game (clue giver and guesser) against a deterministic opponent.  They conduct experiments manipulating various factors such as word concreteness, ambiguity, frequency, and opponent difficulty to analyze LLM performance and strategies.  Results show that commercial LLMs generally outperform open-source models, but even the best-performing models achieve a relatively low win rate (around 50%), highlighting the challenges of tasks requiring ad-hoc concept formation, theory of mind, and pragmatic reasoning.  The study provides valuable insights into LLM limitations and suggests areas for future improvement in these crucial areas of language understanding.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of LLM evaluation, but it's not without its weaknesses.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Evaluation Methodology:** Using Codenames as a benchmark is a creative and insightful approach.  It moves beyond simple question-answering tasks and assesses LLMs' abilities in more complex, interactive scenarios requiring nuanced language understanding, cooperation, and strategic reasoning.  This addresses the "crisis of evaluation" mentioned in the introduction.
* **Comprehensive Experiments:** The authors conduct a series of well-designed experiments manipulating multiple variables, allowing for a thorough analysis of LLM performance under different conditions. The detailed breakdown of error types is also beneficial.
* **Detailed Analysis:** The paper goes beyond simply reporting performance metrics.  It includes in-depth qualitative analysis of LLM strategies, common errors, and successful gameplays, offering rich insights into the models' strengths and weaknesses.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Generalizability:** While the game is complex, it still assesses a specific set of skills.  The findings might not directly translate to all LLM applications.
* **Deterministic Opponent:** Using a deterministic opponent simplifies the evaluation but also reduces the ecological validity. Real-world interactions are less predictable.
* **Resource Intensive:** The experiments involving large language models are computationally expensive, potentially limiting reproducibility for researchers with fewer resources.
* **Focus on Specific Models:** The evaluation is limited to a specific set of LLMs, potentially biasing the results. More diverse model comparisons would strengthen the paper's conclusions.


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's innovative approach to LLM evaluation could inspire further research using game-based benchmarks. The findings highlight the limitations of current LLMs in areas like pragmatic reasoning and theory of mind, prompting researchers to focus on improving these aspects.  The methodology itself is a valuable contribution that can be extended and adapted to evaluate other skills.


**Score: 7**

The paper presents a significant advancement in LLM evaluation methodology with a strong experimental design and in-depth analysis.  However, limitations regarding generalizability and resource requirements prevent it from achieving a higher score. The novelty of the approach and the insights gained are substantial enough to warrant a score above average, but the inherent limitations prevent a higher rating.

### Can you pass that tool?: Implications of Indirect Speech in Physical Human-Robot Collaboration
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11720v1)
- **Authors**: Yan Zhang, Tharaka Sachintha Ratnayake, Cherie Sew, Jarrod Knibbe, Jorge Goncalves, Wafa Johal
- **Abstract**: Indirect speech acts (ISAs) are a natural pragmatic feature of human communication, allowing requests to be conveyed implicitly while maintaining subtlety and flexibility. Although advancements in speech recognition have enabled natural language interactions with robots through direct, explicit commands--providing clarity in communication--the rise of large language models presents the potential for robots to interpret ISAs. However, empirical evidence on the effects of ISAs on human-robot collaboration (HRC) remains limited. To address this, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=36), engaging a participant and a robot in collaborative physical tasks. Our findings indicate that robots capable of understanding ISAs significantly improve human's perceived robot anthropomorphism, team performance, and trust. However, the effectiveness of ISAs is task- and context-dependent, thus requiring careful use. These results highlight the importance of appropriately integrating direct and indirect requests in HRC to enhance collaborative experiences and task performance.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the impact of a robot's ability to understand indirect speech acts (ISAs) on human-robot collaboration (HRC) in physical tasks.  Using a Wizard-of-Oz study with 36 participants performing three collaborative tasks, the researchers compared a robot capable of understanding ISAs with one that only understood direct commands.  Results showed that the ISA-capable robot significantly improved perceived team performance, trust, and anthropomorphism.  However, qualitative data revealed that ISA effectiveness is task- and context-dependent, highlighting the need for a balanced approach integrating both direct and indirect communication strategies in HRC.  The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of human-centered large language models for collaborative robots that account for the nuanced nature of human communication.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly concerning the often-overlooked aspect of indirect communication in physical collaborative tasks.  The study's strengths include:

* **Addressing a significant gap:**  Previous research has largely focused on direct commands or social interactions. This paper directly addresses the lack of empirical evidence on ISAs in physical HRC.
* **Rigorous methodology:** The mixed-methods approach, using both quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews, provides a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. The use of CLMMs for statistical analysis is appropriate for the ordinal data.  The Wizard-of-Oz methodology is acknowledged and justified.
* **Clear findings:** The results clearly demonstrate the positive impact of ISA understanding on key metrics like team fluency, goal alignment, trust, and anthropomorphism.
* **Thoughtful discussion:** The discussion section critically analyzes the findings, acknowledging limitations and suggesting avenues for future research. The identification of task and context dependency is crucial.

However, some weaknesses exist:

* **Wizard-of-Oz limitations:** While justified, the reliance on a Wizard-of-Oz approach limits the generalizability of the findings to fully autonomous systems.  Real-world robots will inevitably make mistakes, which could significantly affect the results.
* **Sample size and demographics:**  The sample size, while determined by power analysis, might still be considered relatively small for broad generalizations.  The predominantly student participant pool limits generalizability to other demographics.
* **Lack of detailed LLM specifics:** The paper does not delve into the specific LLM used (or the implementation details) for the ISA condition, making it difficult to replicate the study and limiting the transferability of results to other LLMs.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's contribution to the understanding of indirect speech in physical HRC is substantial. It provides strong evidence for the benefits of incorporating ISA understanding into collaborative robots, while also highlighting the complexities and contextual considerations involved.  The paper's findings should influence the design of future collaborative robots and the development of more sophisticated natural language processing capabilities within them.

### Enhancing Recommendation Explanations through User-Centric Refinement
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11721v1)
- **Authors**: Jingsen Zhang, Zihang Tian, Xueyang Feng, Xu Chen
- **Abstract**: Generating natural language explanations for recommendations has become increasingly important in recommender systems. Traditional approaches typically treat user reviews as ground truth for explanations and focus on improving review prediction accuracy by designing various model architectures. However, due to limitations in data scale and model capability, these explanations often fail to meet key user-centric aspects such as factuality, personalization, and sentiment coherence, significantly reducing their overall helpfulness to users. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that refines initial explanations generated by existing explainable recommender models during the inference stage to enhance their quality in multiple aspects. Specifically, we introduce a multi-agent collaborative refinement framework based on large language models. To ensure alignment between the refinement process and user demands, we employ a plan-then-refine pattern to perform targeted modifications. To enable continuous improvements, we design a hierarchical reflection mechanism that provides feedback on the refinement process from both strategic and content perspectives. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
- **Summary**: This paper addresses the limitations of existing explainable recommender systems (ERS) in generating user-centric explanations.  Current ERS often rely on user reviews as ground truth, leading to explanations lacking factuality, personalization, and sentiment coherence.  To overcome these limitations, the authors propose RefineX, a novel framework that refines initial explanations generated by existing ERS models during the inference stage.  RefineX uses a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs): a Planner to determine which aspect of the explanation needs refinement, a Refiner to make the changes, and a Reflector to provide feedback on the process. This plan-then-refine approach, coupled with a hierarchical reflection mechanism, enables iterative improvement until the explanation meets user-centric criteria. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate RefineX's effectiveness in enhancing explanation quality across various aspects compared to existing ERS and LLM-based approaches.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of explainable recommendation, addressing a significant gap in existing research. The core idea of post-hoc refinement of explanations using a multi-agent LLM-based system is novel and potentially impactful.  The hierarchical reflection mechanism, incorporating both strategic and content-level feedback, is a clever approach to iterative improvement. The experimental evaluation is thorough, including multiple baselines, datasets, and metrics.  The authors also address limitations and ethical considerations.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on LLMs raises concerns about cost and potential biases. While the authors acknowledge these, a deeper discussion of mitigation strategies would strengthen the paper.  The human evaluation, though valuable, is limited in scale.  Furthermore,  the paper doesn't fully explore the generalizability of the framework beyond the three specific user-centric aspects examined.


The novelty lies in the multi-agent refinement paradigm applied specifically to recommendation explanations, going beyond simply using LLMs for direct generation. The significance stems from its potential to significantly improve the user experience by providing more helpful and accurate explanations. The framework's modularity also suggests potential adaptability to other explanation generation tasks.

### Energy-Conscious LLM Decoding: Impact of Text Generation Strategies on GPU Energy Consumption
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11723v1)
- **Authors**: Alireza Nik, Michael A. Riegler, PÃ¥l Halvorsen
- **Abstract**: Decoding strategies significantly influence the quality and diversity of the generated texts in large language models (LLMs), yet their impact on computational resource consumption, particularly GPU energy usage, is insufficiently studied. This paper investigates the relationship between text generation decoding methods and energy efficiency, focusing on the trade-off between generation quality and GPU energy consumption across diverse tasks and decoding configurations. By benchmarking multiple strategies across different text generation tasks, such as Translation, Code Summarization, and Math Problem Solving, we reveal how selecting appropriate decoding techniques with their tuned hyperparameters affects text quality and has measurable implications for resource utilization, emphasizing the need for balanced optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to explore decoding strategies in LLMs through the lens of energy consumption, offering actionable insights for designing resource-aware applications that maintain high-quality text generation.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the energy efficiency of different decoding strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference.  The authors benchmark several deterministic (greedy, beam search, diverse beam search, contrastive search, DoLa, assisted decoding) and stochastic (temperature sampling, top-k, top-p, epsilon sampling, typical sampling, min-p sampling) decoding methods across three tasks: translation, code summarization, and math problem solving, using the Qwen 2.5 7B-instruction-tuned model.  They measure GPU energy consumption alongside standard quality metrics (BLEU, smoothed BLEU, exact match).  A key contribution is the introduction of an efficiency ratio (quality/energy) and a comprehensive analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity using the Sharpe Ratio, revealing the trade-offs between quality, energy consumption, and stability across various decoding strategies.  Assisted decoding consistently shows high energy efficiency, while beam search methods achieve high quality but at a high energy cost. Stochastic methods generally offer a better balance. The study highlights the need for considering energy efficiency when choosing decoding strategies for LLMs, especially in resource-constrained environments.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution by directly addressing the often-overlooked issue of energy consumption during LLM inference.  The comprehensive benchmarking across multiple tasks and decoding strategies is a strength. The use of the efficiency ratio and Sharpe Ratio provides novel quantitative metrics for comparing decoding methods beyond traditional quality metrics. The detailed analysis of hyperparameter sensitivity is also insightful.

However, some limitations exist. The study focuses on a single, relatively small LLM.  Extending the research to larger models, different architectures, and open-ended generation tasks would significantly strengthen the findings.  The choice of hyperparameter ranges, while informed by prior work, might not be exhaustive.  The reproducibility is partially hampered by using only subsets of the datasets.

The novelty lies primarily in the systematic investigation of the energy-quality trade-off for various decoding strategies and the introduction of new evaluation metrics. While prior work has touched upon energy efficiency in LLMs, this paper provides a more focused and comprehensive study specifically on decoding methods.  The impact could be significant in guiding the development of more energy-efficient LLM applications, particularly in resource-limited settings or for applications emphasizing sustainability.

Score: 7

**Rationale:**  The paper presents a well-executed study with valuable findings, introducing novel evaluation metrics and providing a much-needed focus on energy efficiency in LLM inference. However, the limitations regarding the scope of LLMs and hyperparameters explored prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.  Further work addressing these limitations could significantly increase its impact.  A score of 7 reflects a substantial contribution with clear strengths and acknowledged limitations.

### No-reference geometry quality assessment for colorless point clouds via list-wise rank learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11726v1)
- **Authors**: Zheng Li, Bingxu Xie, Chao Chu, Weiqing Li, Zhiyong Su
- **Abstract**: Geometry quality assessment (GQA) of colorless point clouds is crucial for evaluating the performance of emerging point cloud-based solutions (e.g., watermarking, compression, and 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction). Unfortunately, existing objective GQA approaches are traditional full-reference metrics, whereas state-of-the-art learning-based point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods target both color and geometry distortions, neither of which are qualified for the no-reference GQA task. In addition, the lack of large-scale GQA datasets with subjective scores, which are always imprecise, biased, and inconsistent, also hinders the development of learning-based GQA metrics. Driven by these limitations, this paper proposes a no-reference geometry-only quality assessment approach based on list-wise rank learning, termed LRL-GQA, which comprises of a geometry quality assessment network (GQANet) and a list-wise rank learning network (LRLNet). The proposed LRL-GQA formulates the no-reference GQA as a list-wise rank problem, with the objective of directly optimizing the entire quality ordering. Specifically, a large dataset containing a variety of geometry-only distortions is constructed first, named LRL dataset, in which each sample is label-free but coupled with quality ranking information. Then, the GQANet is designed to capture intrinsic multi-scale patch-wise geometric features in order to predict a quality index for each point cloud. After that, the LRLNet leverages the LRL dataset and a likelihood loss to train the GQANet and ranks the input list of degraded point clouds according to their distortion levels. In addition, the pre-trained GQANet can be fine-tuned further to obtain absolute quality scores. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed no-reference LRL-GQA method compared with existing full-reference GQA metrics.
- **Summary**: This paper presents LRL-GQA, a novel no-reference geometry quality assessment (GQA) method for colorless point clouds.  Existing GQA methods are primarily full-reference or address color and geometry simultaneously, limiting their applicability.  LRL-GQA addresses this by formulating GQA as a list-wise rank learning problem.  It leverages a new large-scale dataset (LRL) with ranked point clouds (rather than absolute quality scores), training a Geometry Quality Assessment Network (GQANet) to predict quality indices.  A List-wise Rank Learning Network (LRLNet) then ranks the point clouds.  The pre-trained GQANet can be further fine-tuned to predict absolute quality scores using a pseudo-MOS dataset (LRL-PMOS). Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing full-reference methods.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a significant gap:** The paper tackles a crucial problemâ€”no-reference GQA for colorless point cloudsâ€”where existing methods are lacking.  The focus on geometry-only assessment is a valuable contribution.
* **Novel approach:**  The use of list-wise rank learning is a novel application to point cloud quality assessment.  This avoids the challenges associated with obtaining accurate subjective scores and focuses on relative quality ranking.
* **Comprehensive dataset:** The creation of the LRL dataset is a significant contribution, addressing the scarcity of large-scale datasets for this specific task.  The use of a pseudo-MOS dataset for fine-tuning is a practical approach to evaluating absolute quality scores.
* **Detailed methodology:** The paper provides a detailed description of the GQANet architecture and the list-wise ranking method, enabling reproducibility.
* **Thorough evaluation:** The paper employs multiple evaluation metrics and compares the proposed method against several baseline methods, providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited comparison with no-reference methods:** While the paper justifies this by stating existing no-reference PCQA methods are not suitable for geometry-only tasks, a stronger argument would involve modifying/adapting existing no-reference methods to the colorless geometry-only scenario and comparing directly with them.  This would strengthen the claim of superiority.
* **Pseudo-MOS reliance:** The reliance on pseudo-MOS, although common practice, introduces a potential limitation.  While the paper explains this limitation and why obtaining true MOS is difficult, direct comparison with true MOS would provide stronger validation. The methodology for generating pseudo-MOS (using angular similarity) should be justified more thoroughly.  Does this approach truly capture perceptual quality across all distortion types?
* **Computational cost:** The paper acknowledges the high computational cost of the deep learning approach compared to traditional methods.  Further investigation into optimizing the network architecture or using more efficient deep learning techniques could enhance the practicality of the method.
* **Generalizability beyond the LRL dataset:** More extensive testing on diverse and publicly available datasets (once such data becomes readily available) would significantly improve the claim of the model's robustness and generalizability.


**Significance and Potential Influence:**

The paper's contribution is noteworthy.  The proposed method effectively addresses a significant challenge in the field of 3D point cloud processing.  The development of the LRL dataset and the novel application of list-wise rank learning are valuable contributions that could inspire future research in this area.  However, the lack of direct comparison with adapted no-reference methods and the reliance on pseudo-MOS slightly limit the overall impact. The work opens avenues for future improvements and comparisons with more sophisticated no-reference methods, as well as further exploration of efficient network architectures.

### Plant in Cupboard, Orange on Table, Book on Shelf. Benchmarking Practical Reasoning and Situation Modelling in a Text-Simulated Situated Environment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11733v1)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Jordan, Sherzod Hakimov, David Schlangen
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have risen to prominence as 'chatbots' for users to interact via natural language. However, their abilities to capture common-sense knowledge make them seem promising as language-based planners of situated or embodied action as well. We have implemented a simple text-based environment -- similar to others that have before been used for reinforcement-learning of agents -- that simulates, very abstractly, a household setting. We use this environment and the detailed error-tracking capabilities we implemented for targeted benchmarking of LLMs on the problem of practical reasoning: Going from goals and observations to actions. Our findings show that environmental complexity and game restrictions hamper performance, and concise action planning is demanding for current LLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper benchmarks the practical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using a novel, simplified text-based environment called AdventureGame.  Unlike more complex embodied AI benchmarks, AdventureGame focuses on isolating practical reasoning â€“ translating goals and observations into actions â€“ within a text-only, household setting.  The authors meticulously track LLM performance, analyzing successes and failures across various difficulty levels (object accessibility, inventory limits) and task variations (single-step vs. planning).  Their findings reveal that while LLM performance generally improves with model size, even the best-performing models struggle with complex navigation, planning, and self-correction.  The study highlights limitations in current LLMs' ability to integrate observations, maintain long-term goals, and avoid hallucinating objects or actions.  AdventureGame itself is presented as a lightweight, extensible benchmark for future research into LLM practical reasoning.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of embodied AI and LLM evaluation, but its novelty and significance are not without limitations.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Benchmark:** AdventureGame offers a simpler, more controlled environment than existing benchmarks, allowing for a clearer focus on practical reasoning in isolation. The detailed error tracking provides valuable insights into the specific failure modes of LLMs.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors use a wide range of LLMs, varying task complexity, and detailed metrics.  This comprehensive approach strengthens the validity and generalizability of their findings.
* **Insightful Analysis:** The qualitative analysis of LLM behaviors, illustrated with examples, provides valuable context to the quantitative results and sheds light on the underlying reasons for success and failure.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Scope:** The text-only nature of AdventureGame limits the generalizability of findings to real-world embodied agents. The lack of a human baseline makes it difficult to assess the true performance level.
* **Relatively Simple Tasks:** While the simplicity is a design feature, the tasks may not fully capture the complexity of real-world practical reasoning. More challenging and diverse tasks could provide a more robust assessment.
* **Limited Novelty in Methodology:** While the benchmark is novel, the core methodology of prompting and evaluating LLMs is not groundbreaking. The paper's strength lies more in the careful design and execution of the experiments rather than a novel methodological approach.

**Overall Significance:**

The paper's contribution is significant in providing a valuable new benchmark and detailed analysis of LLM performance in a specific context. It highlights the limitations of current LLMs in practical reasoning, which is crucial for building robust embodied AI systems. However, the relative simplicity of the tasks and the limited scope of the methodology prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.

Score: 7


The score reflects the paper's valuable contribution in offering a novel benchmark and insightful analysis of LLM shortcomings in practical reasoning. While not revolutionary in its methodology, the careful design, thorough evaluation, and detailed analysis make it a significant contribution that will likely influence future research in the field.  The limitations regarding scope and task complexity suggest room for improvement and prevent a higher score.

### SQL-o1: A Self-Reward Heuristic Dynamic Search Method for Text-to-SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11741v1)
- **Authors**: Shuai Lyu, Haoran Luo, Zhonghong Ou, Yifan Zhu, Xiaoran Shang, Yang Qin, Meina Song
- **Abstract**: The Text-to-SQL(Text2SQL) task aims to convert natural language queries into executable SQL queries. Thanks to the application of large language models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in this field. However, challenges such as model scalability, limited generation space, and coherence issues in SQL generation still persist. To address these issues, we propose SQL-o1, a Self-Reward-based heuristic search method designed to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs in SQL query generation. SQL-o1 combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for heuristic process-level search and constructs a Schema-Aware dataset to help the model better understand database schemas. Extensive experiments on the Bird and Spider datasets demonstrate that SQL-o1 improves execution accuracy by 10.8\% on the complex Bird dataset compared to the latest baseline methods, even outperforming GPT-4-based approaches. Additionally, SQL-o1 excels in few-shot learning scenarios and shows strong cross-model transferability. Our code is publicly available at:https://github.com/ShuaiLyu0110/SQL-o1.
- **Summary**: SQL-o1 is a novel self-reward heuristic dynamic search method for the Text-to-SQL task, aiming to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating accurate SQL queries.  The method addresses challenges in existing LLM-based approaches, including scalability limitations, restricted generation space, and coherence issues. SQL-o1 achieves this through three key components: 1)  a Schema-Aware dataset constructed by comprehensively mining database schemas; 2) Progressive SQL Generation (PSG), a supervised fine-tuning approach that leverages incremental query construction; and 3)  a heuristic dynamic search employing Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a self-reward mechanism.  Experiments on the Bird and Spider datasets demonstrate significant improvements in execution accuracy, particularly on the complex Bird dataset, outperforming even GPT-4-based methods.  SQL-o1 also exhibits strong few-shot learning capabilities and cross-model transferability.


**Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Methodology:** The combination of Schema-Aware data construction, PSG, and MCTS with self-reward is a novel approach to Text-to-SQL. It tackles the problem from a different angle than simply relying on larger LLMs or prompt engineering.
* **Strong Empirical Results:** The significant improvement in accuracy on the Bird dataset, surpassing GPT-4-based methods, is a strong point.  The results on few-shot learning and cross-model transferability further enhance the paper's impact.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper includes a thorough experimental evaluation with multiple datasets, baselines, and ablation studies.  This contributes to the reliability and robustness of the findings.
* **Open-Source Code:** The availability of the code makes the work reproducible and facilitates further research in the community.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Cost:** The use of MCTS introduces significant computational overhead, which may limit its applicability in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. The paper briefly touches on this in the limitations section but doesn't fully explore potential mitigation strategies.
* **Generalizability beyond the Benchmarks:** While the results on Bird and Spider are impressive, it remains to be seen how well the method generalizes to other, significantly different database schemas and question types.
* **Limited Discussion on the Self-Reward Function:** The paper describes the self-reward function but doesn't delve into the details of its design or hyperparameter tuning. This could limit the understandability and reproducibility of the results.


**Significance:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of Text-to-SQL. The proposed method offers a promising alternative to simply scaling up LLMs, which can be expensive and resource-intensive. The strong empirical results, combined with the open-source code, suggest that SQL-o1 has the potential to influence future research and development in this area.  However, the high computational cost needs further consideration for broader practical adoption.


Score: 8

**Rationale:** The paper presents a significant advancement in Text-to-SQL by introducing a novel and effective methodology. The strong empirical results and comprehensive evaluation support its claims.  The limitations regarding computational cost and generalizability, along with the lack of deeper explanation of the self-reward function, prevent it from achieving a perfect score.  However, the overall contribution and potential impact on the field are considerable.

### Language Models Can See Better: Visual Contrastive Decoding For LLM Multimodal Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11751v1)
- **Authors**: Yuqi Pang, Bowen Yang, Haoqin Tu, Yun Cao, Zeyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation for language tasks, they are not specifically designed for multimodal challenges. Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), however, is resource-intensive and constrained by various training limitations. In this paper, we propose the Modular-based Visual Contrastive Decoding (MVCD) framework to move this obstacle. Our framework leverages LLMs' In-Context Learning (ICL) capability and the proposed visual contrastive-example decoding (CED), specifically tailored for this framework, without requiring any additional training. By converting visual signals into text and focusing on contrastive output distributions during decoding, we can highlight the new information introduced by contextual examples, explore their connections, and avoid over-reliance on prior encoded knowledge. MVCD enhances LLMs' visual perception to make it see and reason over the input visuals. To demonstrate MVCD's effectiveness, we conduct experiments with four LLMs across five question answering datasets. Our results not only show consistent improvement in model accuracy but well explain the effective components inside our decoding strategy. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Pbhgit/MVCD.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes Modular-based Visual Contrastive Decoding (MVCD), a framework for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with visual reasoning capabilities without requiring additional model training.  MVCD achieves this by: 1) using a pre-trained visual module (like CLIP and BLIP) to convert images/videos into textual representations (tags, attributes, captions); 2) incorporating these textual features into the LLM's input using an in-context learning (ICL) approach; and 3) employing a novel contrastive-example decoding (CED) strategy to guide the LLM's generation by comparing output probabilities with and without contextual examples.  Experiments on five question answering datasets show consistent improvements in accuracy across different LLMs and shot settings.  The authors also perform ablation studies to analyze the contribution of different components of the framework.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the burgeoning field of multimodal LLMs. The core idea of leveraging existing pre-trained visual models and integrating them with LLMs via in-context learning is clever and avoids the computationally expensive process of full model retraining.  The contrastive decoding strategy adds a layer of sophistication, aiming to improve the LLM's focus on relevant contextual information and avoid over-reliance on prior knowledge.  The extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs strengthen the findings.

However, the novelty is not groundbreaking. The fundamental concepts of using pre-trained visual models and in-context learning are already established techniques.  The CED method, while presented as novel, builds upon existing contrastive learning ideas in the context of language modeling.  The paper could have benefited from a more thorough comparison with other methods that similarly integrate visual information into LLMs without full retraining, demonstrating a clearer demarcation of the proposed method's unique advantages. The ablation study is useful but could be extended to investigate the impact of different hyperparameters in more detail.  Furthermore, the choice of pre-trained visual models is not extensively justified, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.

The potential impact is moderate to high.  The efficiency of MVCD makes it attractive for researchers and developers seeking to quickly integrate visual understanding into existing LLMs. The framework's modular nature allows for flexibility in choosing different visual modules, potentially opening avenues for future research.  However, whether MVCD significantly outperforms other efficient multimodal methods in the long run requires further investigation.  The claim of surpassing MLLMs in Table II needs careful scrutiny, as the comparison involves different models and potentially different training/evaluation setups.


Score: 7

The score reflects the paper's strengths (clever framework design, comprehensive experiments, potential impact) balanced against its limitations (incremental novelty, lack of deeper comparison with related work, some unclear aspects in experimental comparison).

- **Authors**: Michiel van der Meer, Pavel Korshunov, SÃ©bastien Marcel, Lonneke van der Plas
- **Abstract**: Misinformation can be countered with fact-checking, but the process is costly and slow. Identifying checkworthy claims is the first step, where automation can help scale fact-checkers' efforts. However, detection methods struggle with content that is 1) multimodal, 2) from diverse domains, and 3) synthetic. We introduce HintsOfTruth, a public dataset for multimodal checkworthiness detection with $27$K real-world and synthetic image/claim pairs. The mix of real and synthetic data makes this dataset unique and ideal for benchmarking detection methods. We compare fine-tuned and prompted Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that well-configured lightweight text-based encoders perform comparably to multimodal models but the first only focus on identifying non-claim-like content. Multimodal LLMs can be more accurate but come at a significant computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. When faced with synthetic data, multimodal models perform more robustly
- **Summary**: This paper introduces HINTSOFTRUTH, a new publicly available multimodal dataset for checkworthiness detection.  The dataset's unique contribution is its inclusion of both real-world and synthetic image-claim pairs, addressing the limitations of existing datasets which lack either multimodal data or synthetic content. The authors evaluate various text-based, image-based, and multimodal models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), on this dataset.  Surprisingly, they find that well-configured lightweight text-based models perform comparably to more computationally expensive multimodal models, particularly for identifying non-claim-like content. While multimodal LLMs show higher accuracy, their computational cost makes them less practical for large-scale applications. The study highlights the robustness of multimodal models when dealing with synthetic data but also reveals the oversensitivity of lightweight models to synthetic content, leading to increased false positives.  The authors conclude that lightweight models, when carefully tuned, offer a practical balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for checkworthiness detection.  Future work should explore ranking-based approaches and incorporate techniques like Learning to Defer and Active Learning.

**Novelty and Significance:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution by introducing a novel dataset that addresses a critical gap in the field of automated fact-checking. The inclusion of both real and synthetic data is a significant advancement, allowing for a more comprehensive evaluation of checkworthiness detection models.  The experimental design is relatively thorough, comparing various model architectures and sizes.  However, the surprising finding that lightweight text-based models perform comparably to multimodal models raises questions about the actual utility of the multimodal aspect of the dataset and limits the novelty of the main findings. The focus on computational cost is also a welcome addition, providing practical guidance for resource-constrained organizations.  While the dataset itself is a significant contribution, the conclusions drawn from the experiments are somewhat less groundbreaking than might be initially expected. The paper's overall impact on the field will depend heavily on the uptake and use of the HINTSOFTRUTH dataset by the broader research community.

**Strengths:**

* Introduces a novel and much-needed dataset with both real and synthetic data.
* Thoroughly evaluates a range of models, considering both accuracy and computational cost.
* Highlights the importance of considering synthetic data in evaluating misinformation detection models.
* Offers practical recommendations for organizations with limited computational resources.


**Weaknesses:**

* The unexpected finding that lightweight text-based models perform comparably to multimodal models reduces the impact of the multimodal aspect of the dataset.  The paper doesn't deeply explore *why* this is the case.
* The study focuses primarily on English data, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
* The lack of a human evaluation of checkworthiness predictions is a significant limitation.


**Potential Influence:**

The HINTSOFTRUTH dataset has the potential to significantly influence the field. Its availability will allow researchers to develop and benchmark more robust and efficient checkworthiness detection models.  However, the unexpected results regarding the relative performance of text-based versus multimodal models may also stimulate further research into the role of visual information in this task. The focus on computational efficiency is likely to resonate with practitioners, but the overall significance depends on the dataset's adoption rate.

### Warmup-Distill: Bridge the Distribution Mismatch between Teacher and Student before Knowledge Distillation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11766v1)
- **Authors**: Zengkui Sun, Yijin Liu, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou
- **Abstract**: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hindered by the high computational demands, making knowledge distillation (KD) crucial for developing compact smaller ones. However, the conventional KD methods endure the distribution mismatch issue between the teacher and student models, leading to the poor performance of distillation. For instance, the widely-used KL-based methods suffer the mode-averaging and mode-collapsing problems, since the mismatched probabitliy distribution between both models. Previous studies mainly optimize this issue via different distance calculations towards the distribution of both models. Unfortunately, the distribution mismatch issue still exists in the early stage of the distillation. Hence, to reduce the impact of distribution mismatch, we propose a simple yet efficient method, named Warmup-Distill, which aligns the distillation of the student to that of the teacher in advance of distillation. Specifically, we first detect the distribution of the student model in practical scenarios with its internal knowledge, and then modify the knowledge with low probability via the teacher as the checker. Consequently, Warmup-Distill aligns the internal student's knowledge to that of the teacher, which expands the distribution of the student with the teacher's, and assists the student model to learn better in the subsequent distillation. Experiments on the seven benchmarks demonstrate that Warmup-Distill could provide a warmup student more suitable for distillation, which outperforms the vanilla student by as least +0.4 averaged score among all benchmarks. Noteably, with the assistance of Warmup-Distill, the distillation on the math task could yield a further improvement, at most +1.9% accuracy.
- **Summary**: Warmup-Distill addresses the distribution mismatch problem in knowledge distillation (KD) for Large Language Models (LLMs).  Existing KD methods often struggle because the student and teacher models have different output distributions, leading to issues like mode averaging and mode collapsing.  Warmup-Distill proposes a pre-distillation "warmup" stage.  This stage samples outputs from the student, uses the teacher to identify low-probability tokens in these samples, and then replaces these tokens with teacher-generated alternatives. This aligns the student's internal knowledge distribution with the teacher's, improving the subsequent KD process. Experiments on instruction-following and math benchmarks show Warmup-Distill consistently improves the performance of various KD techniques, particularly on the more challenging math tasks.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

Warmup-Distill presents a novel approach to address a known and significant problem in LLM knowledge distillation. The idea of pre-aligning the student's distribution before distillation is intuitively appealing and addresses a weakness in existing methods that primarily focus on optimizing the distribution mismatch *during* distillation.  The proposed method is relatively simple to implement, which is a strength. The experimental results, across multiple benchmarks and model architectures, support the claim of improved performance.  The authors also conduct ablation studies to investigate the impact of hyperparameters, strengthening the paper's overall contribution.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on a teacher model to correct student outputs feels somewhat indirect.  While it addresses the distribution mismatch, it doesn't directly tackle the underlying reasons for the discrepancies in the first place (e.g., architectural differences, training data differences).  The paper also mentions potential limitations concerning "alignment tax" from the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) method used for distribution alignment, but does not fully explore mitigating this. The novelty lies more in the application of this pre-distillation strategy rather than a completely new theoretical framework.

Considering both strengths and weaknesses, Warmup-Distill makes a valuable contribution to the field by providing a practical and effective solution to a widespread problem. The simplicity, combined with consistent improvement across various benchmarks, demonstrates its potential for wider adoption.  However, it doesn't fundamentally revolutionize KD but instead offers a clever improvement to existing techniques.  The lack of deeper investigation into the underlying causes of the distribution mismatch and the acknowledgement of potential limitations prevents a higher score.

Rossi, Julian McAuley
- **Abstract**: Active Learning (AL) has been a powerful paradigm for improving model efficiency and performance by selecting the most informative data points for labeling and training. In recent active learning frameworks, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed not only for selection but also for generating entirely new data instances and providing more cost-effective annotations. Motivated by the increasing importance of high-quality data and efficient model training in the era of LLMs, we present a comprehensive survey on LLM-based Active Learning. We introduce an intuitive taxonomy that categorizes these techniques and discuss the transformative roles LLMs can play in the active learning loop. We further examine the impact of AL on LLM learning paradigms and its applications across various domains. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research directions. This survey aims to serve as an up-to-date resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to gain an intuitive understanding of LLM-based AL techniques and deploy them to new applications.
- **Summary**: This survey paper, "From Selection to Generation: A Survey of LLM-based Active Learning," comprehensively reviews the emerging field of active learning enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs).  The authors propose a taxonomy categorizing LLM-based active learning techniques based on their querying (selection or generation of unlabeled data) and annotation (human or LLM-based) methods.  The survey covers various aspects, including traditional active learning strategies, LLM-based selection and generation techniques, different annotation schemes, cost-aware termination criteria, the influence of active learning on LLM training paradigms, diverse applications across NLP tasks, and open challenges for future research.  The paper provides a structured overview of existing work, facilitating a better understanding of this rapidly evolving area.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper's strength lies in its timely and thorough compilation of existing research on LLM-based active learning.  This is a rapidly developing area, and a comprehensive survey is valuable for researchers and practitioners. The proposed taxonomy is a useful organizational tool, providing a clear structure for understanding the different approaches. The detailed discussion of various techniques, including their strengths and weaknesses, is also commendable.  The identification of open challenges and future research directions is helpful in guiding future work.

However, the paper's novelty is limited.  While it presents a valuable synthesis of existing work, it doesn't introduce any fundamentally new methods or theoretical frameworks.  It primarily organizes and analyzes existing publications, rather than contributing original research findings.  The critical evaluation of existing methods could be more in-depth, with a more nuanced comparison of their relative merits and limitations across different tasks and datasets.  The paper also suffers slightly from length; some sections could be more concise.

The potential influence on the field is moderate to high. The survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers entering the field, providing a roadmap for understanding and contributing to the area.  However, its impact will depend on the extent to which future research builds upon and extends the ideas and challenges presented in the paper.

Score: 7

**Rationale:** The score of 7 reflects the paper's significant contribution in consolidating and clarifying a rapidly evolving field. While lacking groundbreaking novelty in terms of introducing entirely new methods, its comprehensive nature and well-structured taxonomy make it a highly useful resource.  The potential impact is considerable, but the lack of substantial original contributions prevents it from achieving a higher score.  A higher score would require more critical analysis and comparison of the surveyed methods, as well as the introduction of novel insights or a unifying theoretical framework.

### Cognitive-Aligned Document Selection for Retrieval-augmented Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11770v1)
- **Authors**: Bingyu Wan, Fuxi Zhang, Zhongpeng Qi, Jiayi Ding, Jijun Li, Baoshi Fan, Yijia Zhang, Jun Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) inherently display hallucinations since the precision of generated texts cannot be guaranteed purely by the parametric knowledge they include. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance the accuracy and reliability of generative models by incorporating external documents, these retrieved documents often fail to adequately support the model's responses in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose GGatrieval (Fine-\textbf{G}rained \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{A}lignment Re\textbf{trieval} for verifiable generation), which leverages an LLM to dynamically update queries and filter high-quality, reliable retrieval documents. Specifically, we parse the user query into its syntactic components and perform fine-grained grounded alignment with the retrieved documents. For query components that cannot be individually aligned, we propose a dynamic semantic compensation mechanism that iteratively refines and rewrites the query while continuously updating the retrieval results. This iterative process continues until the retrieved documents sufficiently support the query's response. Our approach introduces a novel criterion for filtering retrieved documents, closely emulating human strategies for acquiring targeted information. This ensures that the retrieved content effectively supports and verifies the generated outputs. On the ALCE benchmark, our method significantly surpasses a wide range of baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces GGatrieval, a framework for improving retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.  RAG systems combine large language models (LLMs) with external document retrieval to enhance accuracy and reduce hallucinations.  GGatrieval addresses the issue of low-quality retrieved documents by proposing a novel document selection criterion based on the cognitive process of human information retrieval. This criterion, Fine-Grained Grounded Alignment (FGA), assesses the semantic alignment between a query's syntactic components and segments within retrieved documents.  To improve alignment, GGatrieval employs a Semantic Compensation Query Update (SCQU) strategy, iteratively refining queries and retrieving additional documents until sufficient alignment is achieved.  Experiments on several benchmarks show that GGatrieval significantly outperforms existing RAG methods.

**Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of RAG, but its novelty and significance are not without limitations.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Document Selection Criterion:** The core contributionâ€”a document selection criterion based on fine-grained syntactic and semantic alignmentâ€”is novel and addresses a critical weakness in existing RAG systems.  The rationale behind mimicking human cognitive processes is well-articulated.
* **Iterative Query Refinement:** The SCQU strategy is a practical approach to improve document retrieval by iteratively refining the query based on alignment feedback.  The demonstrated improvement in retrieval efficiency is a significant advantage.
* **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results across multiple datasets and baselines, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.  The ablation studies offer valuable insights into the contribution of different components of the proposed method.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Cost:** The reliance on LLMs for syntactic parsing and semantic alignment introduces significant computational costs.  While the paper acknowledges this limitation, a deeper discussion of strategies to mitigate this cost would strengthen the contribution.
* **Over-reliance on LLMs:** The approach is heavily dependent on the capabilities of LLMs.  The performance is inherently limited by the LLMs used, and robustness to potential LLM limitations (biases, inconsistencies) is not fully explored.
* **Limited Theoretical Analysis:**  While empirical results are strong, a more thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed criterion and strategies would further solidify the contribution's significance.  The explanation of why certain strategies work remains largely empirical.


**Overall Significance:**  GGatrieval proposes a novel and effective method for improving RAG systems. The focus on cognitive alignment is a valuable perspective, and the empirical results are compelling. However, the significant computational cost and dependence on LLMs limit the immediate applicability and broader impact.  While it pushes the state-of-the-art, the lack of deeper theoretical analysis and strategies to address scalability prevents it from being a truly transformative contribution.

### The Validation Gap: A Mechanistic Analysis of How Language Models Compute Arithmetic but Fail to Validate It
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11771v1)
- **Authors**: Leonardo Bertolazzi, Philipp Mondorf, Barbara Plank, Raffaella Bernardi
- **Abstract**: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to validate their output and identify potential errors is crucial for ensuring robustness and reliability. However, current research indicates that LLMs struggle with self-correction, encountering significant challenges in detecting errors. While studies have explored methods to enhance self-correction in LLMs, relatively little attention has been given to understanding the models' internal mechanisms underlying error detection. In this paper, we present a mechanistic analysis of error detection in LLMs, focusing on simple arithmetic problems. Through circuit analysis, we identify the computational subgraphs responsible for detecting arithmetic errors across four smaller-sized LLMs. Our findings reveal that all models heavily rely on $\textit{consistency heads}$--attention heads that assess surface-level alignment of numerical values in arithmetic solutions. Moreover, we observe that the models' internal arithmetic computation primarily occurs in higher layers, whereas validation takes place in middle layers, before the final arithmetic results are fully encoded. This structural dissociation between arithmetic computation and validation seems to explain why current LLMs struggle to detect even simple arithmetic errors.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates why large language models (LLMs) struggle to detect errors in simple arithmetic problems, despite often correctly solving them.  Using circuit analysis on four smaller LLMs, the authors discover that error detection relies heavily on "consistency heads"â€”attention heads in middle layers that check for surface-level agreement between intermediate calculations and final answers.  Crucially, the actual arithmetic computation happens in higher layers, creating a structural dissociation between computation and validation.  This separation explains the failure to detect errors, even when the correct answer is implicitly computed.  The authors demonstrate that adding information from higher layers to lower layers improves error detection, suggesting a way to "close the validation gap."

**Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to mechanistic interpretability, offering a novel explanation for a common LLM failure mode. The use of circuit analysis to pinpoint specific computational subgraphs responsible for error detection is a strength, going beyond simple performance analysis. The identification of "consistency heads" as key components in this process is insightful and potentially generalizable beyond arithmetic. The experimental results, particularly the improvement in error detection by bridging the computational and validation layers, are compelling.

However, the study is limited by its focus on small LLMs and simple arithmetic problems.  The generalizability to larger models and more complex reasoning tasks remains to be seen.  The reliance on edge attribution patching, a linear approximation of activation patching, could also affect the completeness and accuracy of the identified circuits.  While the authors acknowledge these limitations, their impact on the broader significance of the findings needs further consideration.  The  "closing the validation gap"  solution is a promising direction but  is relatively simplistic and may not scale to more complex scenarios.

Considering the novelty of the mechanistic explanation, the identification of consistency heads, and the experimental validation, the paper represents a significant step forward in understanding LLM limitations.  However, the limitations regarding scale and method rigor prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution.

### video-SALMONN-o1: Reasoning-enhanced Audio-visual Large Language Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11775v1)
- **Authors**: Guangzhi Sun, Yudong Yang, Jimin Zhuang, Changli Tang, Yixuan Li, Wei Li, Zejun MA, Chao Zhang
- **Abstract**: While recent advancements in reasoning optimization have significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), existing efforts to improve reasoning have been limited to solving mathematical problems and focusing on visual graphical inputs, neglecting broader applications in general video understanding.This paper proposes video-SALMONN-o1, the first open-source reasoning-enhanced audio-visual LLM designed for general video understanding tasks. To enhance its reasoning abilities, we develop a reasoning-intensive dataset featuring challenging audio-visual questions with step-by-step solutions. We also propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), which leverages contrastive step selection to achieve efficient step-level reward modelling tailored for multimodal inputs. Additionally, we introduce RivaBench, the first reasoning-intensive video understanding benchmark, featuring over 4,000 high-quality, expert-curated question-answer pairs across scenarios such as standup comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection. video-SALMONN-o1 achieves 3-8% accuracy improvements over the LLaVA-OneVision baseline across different video reasoning benchmarks. Besides, pDPO achieves 6-8% improvements compared to the supervised fine-tuning model on RivaBench. Enhanced reasoning enables video-SALMONN-o1 zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces video-SALMONN-o1, an open-source audio-visual large language model (LLM) designed for enhanced reasoning in general video understanding tasks.  To achieve this, the authors create a reasoning-intensive dataset with step-by-step solutions and propose process direct preference optimization (pDPO), a novel reinforcement learning method leveraging contrastive step selection for efficient multimodal reward modeling.  They also introduce RivaBench, a new benchmark focusing on challenging audio-visual reasoning scenarios (stand-up comedy, academic presentations, and synthetic video detection).  video-SALMONN-o1 outperforms baselines on existing benchmarks and demonstrates zero-shot synthetic video detection capabilities.


**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper makes several contributions, but their novelty and significance are not uniformly strong.

**Strengths:**

* **Addressing a gap:** The work directly addresses the under-exploration of reasoning in general video understanding, focusing on the interplay of audio and visual modalities beyond simpler tasks like mathematical problem solving from images. This is a significant area needing attention.
* **pDPO:** The proposed pDPO method offers a potentially more efficient approach to reinforcement learning for reasoning by focusing on crucial steps identified through contrastive step selection. This could be impactful if it demonstrably reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy.
* **RivaBench:** The introduction of RivaBench provides a valuable new benchmark for evaluating audio-visual reasoning capabilities, especially in diverse scenarios.  The inclusion of expert-curated data is a strength.
* **Open-source:** Making the model and data open-source is crucial for reproducibility and community contribution, significantly increasing its potential impact.
* **Zero-shot synthetic video detection:** The zero-shot performance on a novel task showcases the potential of enhanced reasoning for emergent capabilities.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental Advancements:** While the pDPO method is presented as novel, it builds upon existing work in direct preference optimization and process reward models. The novelty lies primarily in its adaptation and application to the specific context of audio-visual reasoning.
* **Limited Baseline Comparison:** The comparison to open-source baselines is somewhat limited, especially given the rapid pace of development in the field.  A more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art models would strengthen the paper.
* **Evaluation Metrics:**  While accuracy is reported, a deeper dive into other evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score for specific sub-tasks) would provide a more complete picture of performance.  The reliance on GPT-4o for some evaluation steps introduces a potential bias and limitation.
* **Data Bias:** The paper acknowledges potential biases inherent in the pre-trained models and datasets, but a more thorough discussion of mitigation strategies and analysis of the bias present in the results would be beneficial.


**Overall Score Justification:**

The paper addresses a significant and timely problem, introduces a potentially valuable method (pDPO) and benchmark (RivaBench), and demonstrates promising results. However, the novelty of the core techniques is incremental, and the evaluation could be strengthened. The open-source nature and the zero-shot detection are major pluses.  Considering these factors, a score reflecting a solid but not groundbreaking contribution is appropriate.

### Efficient Response Generation Method Selection for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11779v1)
- **Authors**: Xuan Ren, Qi Chen, Lingqiao Liu
- **Abstract**: The training data for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is typically structured as input-output pairs. However, for many tasks, there can be multiple equally valid output variations for the same input. Recent studies have observed that the choice of output variation used in training can affect the model's performance. This raises an important question: how can we generate the most effective output from the many possible response generation strategy options? Rather than relying on the traditional but resource-intensive train-and-evaluate approach, this paper proposes a scalable, approximate method for estimating the quality of a small subset of generated training data derived from the same input. We then evaluate how well this small subset of generated output fits the target model we are trying to train. We present a large-scale benchmark covering diverse reasoning-based datasets to support our study. The central idea is that a good output should closely resemble the output generated by the target LLM. We formalize this 'closeness' as the expected alignment score between a candidate output and the output sampled from the target LLM. We connect this measurement to the perplexity metric used in previous literature and demonstrate that leveraging an alignment-based metric can provide better predictions of model performance. Using this strategy, we can evaluate a small subset of the generated output from each response generation strategy option, then select the most effective strategy. We show that an LLM trained on data generated by the selected strategy could lead to a significant performance gain in many cases.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes an efficient method for selecting the optimal response generation strategy when fine-tuning large language models (LLMs).  Existing methods rely on computationally expensive train-and-evaluate cycles for each strategy.  This work addresses this by proposing a scalable approach that estimates the quality of a small subset of generated training data based on its "alignment" with the target LLM's output style.  This alignment is quantified using a similarity function, generalizing the perplexity metric.  The authors demonstrate, through large-scale experiments across diverse reasoning datasets, that their alignment-based metric better predicts model performance than existing methods and leads to significant performance gains compared to baselines that use a single response generation strategy.  The method shows robustness to variations in the selected data subset.  However, limitations exist concerning scalability to very large datasets and applicability to recently released, smaller LLMs.  The paper also reveals that simply combining multiple response variations doesn't guarantee improved performance, highlighting the continued importance of strategic response generation selection.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM fine-tuning, addressing a crucial practical challenge: efficiently selecting training data generation strategies. The proposed alignment-based metric offers a more efficient alternative to exhaustive train-and-evaluate approaches, potentially saving significant computational resources.  The large-scale benchmarking across diverse tasks strengthens the claims.  The connection to perplexity provides a theoretical grounding, and the empirical results demonstrating performance improvements are compelling.


However, some limitations weaken the overall impact:

* **Scalability:** The current experiments are limited to datasets of up to 1000 samples. The method's efficacy with larger datasets remains unproven, a critical factor given the scale of typical LLM training data.
* **Applicability to smaller LLMs:** The recent surge of smaller, open-source LLMs warrants investigation into the method's applicability to these models, which was acknowledged as a limitation by the authors.
* **Inherent Bias:** The method relies on the target LLM's output as a gold standard. This could introduce bias, particularly if the target LLM has limitations in the specific task.  Further exploration of alternative gold standards or techniques for mitigating this bias is necessary.
* **Overreliance on CoT responses:** The method's evaluation is skewed towards tasks that yield paragraph-length responses (allowing semantic similarity calculations). This limits its applicability to tasks with simpler outputs like true/false answers.


Despite these limitations, the paper's core ideaâ€”using alignment with the target LLM as a proxy for training data qualityâ€”is novel and potentially highly impactful. The proposed approach offers a practical solution to a significant problem and provides a strong foundation for future research into more efficient LLM training strategies.  The thorough experimentation and analysis demonstrate a solid effort, although some of the analysis could be deepened.


Score: 8

**Rationale:**  The score reflects the significant novelty and potential impact of the core methodology, coupled with the thorough experimental validation. The limitations regarding scalability and applicability to smaller LLMs, however, prevent a higher score. The paper's contribution would be even stronger with a more in-depth discussion of potential biases and future research directions to address these limitations.

### Personality Editing for Language Models through Relevant Knowledge Editing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11789v1)
- **Authors**: Seojin Hwang, Yumin Kim, Byeongjeong Kim, Hwanhee Lee
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) play a vital role in applications like conversational agents and content creation, where controlling a model's personality is crucial for maintaining tone, consistency, and engagement. However, traditional prompt-based techniques for controlling personality often fall short, as they do not effectively mitigate the model's inherent biases. In this paper, we introduce a novel method PALETTE that enhances personality control through knowledge editing. By generating adjustment queries inspired by psychological assessments, our approach systematically adjusts responses to personality-related queries similar to modifying factual knowledge, thereby achieving controlled shifts in personality traits. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our method enables more stable and well-balanced personality control in LLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces PALETTE, a novel method for controlling the personality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by editing their internal knowledge.  Unlike traditional prompt-based approaches, which often fail to consistently mitigate inherent biases, PALETTE uses a rank-one model editing technique (r-ROME) to adjust the LLM's responses to personality-related queries.  These queries are generated based on a structured psychological assessment (MBTI).  Experiments using automatic and human evaluation demonstrate that PALETTE effectively re-balances personality traits, achieving a significant increase in the targeted trait ratio (13-19%) and further improving with combined prompt-based techniques.  While computationally more expensive than prompt-based methods, PALETTE offers more stable and interpretable personality shifts, addressing inherent LLM biases.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score Justification:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM personality control, but its novelty and significance are not without limitations.

**Strengths:**

* **Novel Approach:**  The core idea of using knowledge editing to directly manipulate an LLM's internal representation of personality is novel and addresses a critical limitation of existing prompt-based and fine-tuning methods. The use of structured psychological assessments for query generation is also a thoughtful approach to systematically targeting personality traits.
* **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes both automatic and human evaluation, strengthening the credibility of its findings. The inclusion of multiple model sizes adds to the generalizability of the results.  The discussion of the limitations of IKE and prompt-based methods effectively positions PALETTE within the existing literature.
* **Addressing Bias:**  The paper directly addresses the issue of inherent biases in LLMs, a critical concern in the field.  The results demonstrate a successful mitigation of these biases.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Computational Cost:** The acknowledged higher computational cost compared to prompt-based methods is a significant drawback.  The paper doesn't fully explore potential optimization strategies to mitigate this.
* **Limited Scope:** The study focuses solely on the MBTI framework.  Extending the approach to other personality models would significantly broaden its applicability and impact.
* **Generalizability:** While multiple model sizes were used, the reliance on a specific LLM architecture (Qwen) raises questions about generalizability to other architectures.

**Overall Significance:**

PALETTE represents a significant advancement in LLM personality control. The approach of directly modifying internal knowledge offers a more robust and interpretable solution than existing methods. However, the computational cost and limited scope prevent it from being a groundbreaking, universally applicable solution.  The impact of this work will likely be felt more within the specific area of knowledge editing techniques rather than a sweeping change across the broader LLM personality control field.

### BackdoorDM: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Backdoor Learning in Diffusion Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11798v1)
- **Authors**: Weilin Lin, Nanjun Zhou, Yanyun Wang, Jianze Li, Hui Xiong, Li Liu
- **Abstract**: Backdoor learning is a critical research topic for understanding the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks. While it has been extensively studied in discriminative models over the past few years, backdoor learning in diffusion models (DMs) has recently attracted increasing attention, becoming a new research hotspot. Although many different backdoor attack and defense methods have been proposed for DMs, a comprehensive benchmark for backdoor learning in DMs is still lacking. This absence makes it difficult to conduct fair comparisons and thoroughly evaluate existing approaches, thus hindering future research progress. To address this issue, we propose BackdoorDM, the first comprehensive benchmark designed for backdoor learning in DMs. It comprises nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack methods, four SOTA defense strategies, and two helpful visualization analysis tools. We first systematically classify and formulate the existing literature in a unified framework, focusing on three different backdoor attack types and five backdoor target types, which are restricted to a single type in discriminative models. Then, we systematically summarize the evaluation metrics for each type and propose a unified backdoor evaluation method based on GPT-4o. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation and highlight several important conclusions. We believe that BackdoorDM will help overcome current barriers and contribute to building a trustworthy DMs community. The codes are released in https://github.com/linweiii/BackdoorDM.
- **Summary**: BackdoorDM is the first comprehensive benchmark for backdoor attacks and defenses in diffusion models (DMs).  The paper addresses the lack of standardized evaluation in this rapidly developing area.  It presents a unified framework classifying backdoor attack types (based on input manipulation) and target types (e.g., image replacement, style modification).  BackdoorDM integrates nine state-of-the-art attack methods and four defense strategies, offering a standardized evaluation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 for assessing model specificity, utility, and attack efficiency.  Two visualization tools aid in understanding backdoor mechanisms. Experiments across various datasets and models highlight the performance of different attacks and defenses, revealing strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches.  The code is publicly available.

**Critical Evaluation and Score Rationale:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of diffusion model security.  The creation of a comprehensive benchmark, including a unified framework for classifying attacks and targets, is a much-needed resource.  The use of GPT-4 for evaluation is novel and addresses limitations of previous methods, offering a more holistic and adaptable approach. The inclusion of visualization tools enhances understanding of backdoor mechanisms.

However, the paper's strength is also its limitation.  Focusing on only nine attack methods and four defenses, while comprehensive for the current state-of-the-art, might not represent the full spectrum of possible future attacks. The benchmarkâ€™s current scope (unconditional and text-to-image DMs) leaves out other important DM applications (TTS, T2V).  The reliance on GPT-4, while innovative, introduces a dependence on an external, potentially evolving system for evaluation.  Finally, while the paper provides many experimental results, a more concise and impactful presentation of the key findings would strengthen its impact.

Despite these weaknesses, BackdoorDM provides a solid foundation for future research in DM security. Its standardized approach and readily available code will facilitate fairer comparisons and accelerate the development of more robust defenses.  The use of GPT-4 for evaluation marks a promising advancement in the field.

### Table-Critic: A Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Criticism and Refinement in Table Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11799v1)
- **Authors**: Peiying Yu, Guoxin Chen, Jingjing Wang
- **Abstract**: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in various reasoning tasks, they still struggle with table reasoning tasks, particularly in maintaining consistency throughout multi-step reasoning processes. While existing approaches have explored various decomposition strategies, they often lack effective mechanisms to identify and correct errors in intermediate reasoning steps, leading to cascading error propagation. To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that Table-Critic achieves substantial improvements over existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and error correction rates while maintaining computational efficiency and lower solution degradation rate.
- **Summary**: Table-Critic is a multi-agent framework designed to improve Large Language Model (LLM) performance on table reasoning tasks.  Existing methods struggle with consistency in multi-step reasoning, leading to error propagation. Table-Critic addresses this by employing four specialized agents: a Judge (error identification), a Critic (detailed critiques), a Refiner (process improvement), and a Curator (pattern distillation from experience).  These agents iteratively refine the reasoning process until a correct solution is reached, guided by a self-evolving template tree that categorizes and stores critique knowledge.  Experiments on WikiTableQuestions and TabFact datasets demonstrate significant accuracy improvements over existing methods, particularly on complex, multi-step reasoning problems, while maintaining reasonable computational efficiency.  The self-evolving template tree is shown to be crucial for this improved performance.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score Rationale:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of table reasoning with LLMs. The multi-agent approach, particularly the iterative refinement and the self-evolving template tree, directly addresses a critical weakness of current methods: error propagation.  The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of Table-Critic across multiple LLMs and datasets. The detailed analysis of computational cost and the ablation study further strengthen the paper's claims.

However, some limitations exist.  The reliance on a pre-existing table reasoning method (Chain-of-Table) for the initial reasoning chain limits the generality of the claim. While the paper acknowledges this, future work could explore the applicability of Table-Critic with other baselines.  The complexity of the multi-agent system might also pose challenges for implementation and scalability. The self-evolving template tree, while innovative, lacks explicit details on the algorithms used for template creation and tree expansion, potentially limiting reproducibility.

Despite these limitations, the novelty of the multi-agent collaborative criticism and refinement framework, combined with the self-evolving template tree, represents a substantial advancement.  The paper's thorough experimentation and analysis make a strong case for its significance in improving the robustness and accuracy of LLM-based table reasoning.

### Exploring Translation Mechanism of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11806v1)
- **Authors**: Hongbin Zhang, Kehai Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Xiucheng Li, Min Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in multilingual translation tasks. However, the inherent translation mechanisms of LLMs remain poorly understood, largely due to sophisticated architectures and vast parameter scales. In response to this issue, this study explores the translation mechanism of LLM from the perspective of computational components (e.g., attention heads and MLPs). Path patching is utilized to explore causal relationships between components, detecting those crucial for translation tasks and subsequently analyzing their behavioral patterns in human-interpretable terms. Comprehensive analysis reveals that translation is predominantly facilitated by a sparse subset of specialized attention heads (less than 5\%), which extract source language, indicator, and positional features. MLPs subsequently integrate and process these features by transiting towards English-centric latent representations. Notably, building on the above findings, targeted fine-tuning of only 64 heads achieves translation improvement comparable to full-parameter tuning while preserving general capabilities.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the translation mechanisms within large language models (LLMs).  Using path patching, the authors identify a small subset (less than 5%) of attention heads and MLP layers crucial for translation.  These crucial components exhibit specialized functions: attention heads focus on source language, positional information, and translation indicators, while MLPs integrate these features, transitioning towards English-centric representations.  The authors demonstrate that fine-tuning only these crucial components (e.g., 64 heads) achieves comparable translation performance to full-parameter fine-tuning while preserving the model's general capabilities.  Their findings suggest a "bridge-translation" paradigm where LLMs may implicitly use English as an intermediary representation.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of mechanistic interpretability of LLMs. The use of path patching to identify causally important components is a rigorous approach, going beyond simple observation of activation patterns. The identification of specialized attention heads and the English-centric intermediate representation offers novel insights into the internal workings of LLM translation.  The targeted fine-tuning experiment provides strong empirical support for the findings, showcasing the potential for efficient model improvement.

However, the study has limitations. The focus on a simplified, word-level translation task limits the generalizability of the findings to more complex, real-world sentence-level translation. The reliance on a specific set of LLMs also raises concerns about the broad applicability of the discovered mechanisms.  The "English-centric" hypothesis, while interesting, relies on correlation and doesn't definitively prove a causal relationship.  Furthermore, the paper's overall length and detail make it dense and potentially difficult for a broad audience to fully grasp.

Despite these limitations, the paper's rigorous methodology, novel findings, and practical implications (efficient fine-tuning) make it a significant contribution.  The identification of specialized components offers potential for improving LLMs' efficiency and interpretability.

### FineFilter: A Fine-grained Noise Filtering Mechanism for Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11811v1)
- **Authors**: Qianchi Zhang, Hainan Zhang, Liang Pang, Hongwei Zheng, Yongxin Tong, Zhiming Zheng
- **Abstract**: Retrieved documents containing noise will hinder Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from detecting answer clues, necessitating noise filtering mechanisms to enhance accuracy.Existing methods use re-ranking or summarization to identify the most relevant sentences, but directly and accurately locating answer clues from these large-scale and complex documents remains challenging. Unlike these document-level operations, we treat noise filtering as a sentence-level MinMax optimization problem: first identifying the potential clues from multiple documents using contextual information, then ranking them by relevance, and finally retaining the least clues through truncation. In this paper, we propose FineFilter, a novel fine-grained noise filtering mechanism for RAG consisting of a clue extractor, a re-ranker, and a truncator. We optimize each module to tackle complex reasoning challenges: (1) Clue extractor firstly uses sentences containing the answer and similar ones as fine-tuned targets, aiming at extracting sufficient potential clues; (2) Re-ranker is trained to prioritize effective clues based on the real feedback from generation module, with clues capable of generating correct answer as positive samples and others as negative; (3) Truncator takes the minimum clues needed to answer the question (truncation point) as fine-tuned targets, and performs truncation on the re-ranked clues to achieve fine-grained noise filtering. Experiments on three QA datasets demonstrate that FineFilter significantly outperforms baselines in terms of performance and inference cost. Further analysis on each module shows the effectiveness of our optimizations for complex reasoning.
- **Summary**: FineFilter is a novel fine-grained noise filtering mechanism for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models.  It addresses the problem of irrelevant information in retrieved documents hindering accurate answer generation. Unlike existing document-level approaches (re-ranking or summarization), FineFilter operates at the sentence level using a three-module pipeline: a clue extractor, a re-ranker, and a truncator.  The extractor identifies potential answer clues, the re-ranker prioritizes them based on generation model feedback, and the truncator minimizes the number of clues needed for accurate answers.  Experiments on three question answering datasets (NQ, TriviaQA, HotpotQA) demonstrate improved performance and efficiency compared to baselines, particularly for complex, multi-hop questions.  The paper highlights the effectiveness of its KNN-based clue extraction and adaptive truncation strategies.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Novelty and Significance:**

FineFilter presents a novel approach to noise filtering in RAG by focusing on sentence-level operations and using a three-module pipeline.  The use of KNN clustering for clue extraction and feedback-driven re-ranking and truncation are incremental improvements over existing methods.  However, the core concept of filtering noisy sentences before feeding them to a language model is not entirely new.  The paper's strength lies in the systematic combination and optimization of these techniques, resulting in demonstrable performance gains. The MinMax optimization framing is a useful conceptual contribution, but its practical impact might be less significant than the specific module designs.


**Strengths:**

* **Sentence-level operation:** This provides a more fine-grained approach than existing document-level methods.
* **Three-module pipeline:** The modular design allows for independent optimization and analysis of each component.
* **Feedback-driven learning:** Utilizing generation model feedback for re-ranking and truncation improves the adaptation of the filter to the specific characteristics of the generation model.
* **KNN-based clue extraction:** This method effectively addresses the challenge of multi-hop reasoning by incorporating contextual information beyond just sentences containing the answer.
* **Comprehensive experimental evaluation:** The paper presents results on three diverse datasets and compares against a range of baselines.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited novelty:**  While the combination of techniques is novel, the individual components are not groundbreaking.
* **Tight coupling with the generation model:**  The reliance on generation model feedback for training the re-ranker and truncator limits the transferability of FineFilter to different generation models. Retraining would be required for each new model.
* **Lack of analysis on robustness and generalizability:** The paper doesn't extensively explore how well FineFilter performs on unseen data or under varying conditions (e.g., different retriever performances).


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's contribution lies in its practical improvement to RAG systems.  The proposed approach might be adopted by researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of RAG-based question answering systems. The modular design facilitates further research on individual components. However, its impact might be constrained by its dependence on the generation model.


**Score: 7**

The score reflects the paper's contributions.  While the method shows promising results and introduces a useful framework, the novelty is incremental rather than revolutionary. The dependence on retraining for new generation models is a significant limitation.  The overall impact on the field will depend on how widely adopted this approach becomes and whether future work addresses the limitations identified.

### Towards Understanding Fine-Tuning Mechanisms of LLMs via Circuit Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11812v1)
- **Authors**: Xu Wang, Yan Hu, Wenyu Du, Reynold Cheng, Benyou Wang, Difan Zou
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning significantly improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This paper aims to provide an in-depth interpretation of the fine-tuning process through circuit analysis, a popular tool in Mechanistic Interpretability (MI). Unlike previous studies \cite{prakash2024finetuningenhancesexistingmechanisms,chhabra2024neuroplasticity} that focus on tasks where pre-trained models already perform well, we develop a set of mathematical tasks where fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains, which are closer to the practical setting. In our experiments, we identify circuits at various checkpoints during fine-tuning and examine the interplay between circuit analysis, fine-tuning methods, and task complexities. First, we find that while circuits maintain high node similarity before and after fine-tuning, their edges undergo significant changes, which is in contrast to the previous work \cite{prakash2024finetuningenhancesexistingmechanisms,chhabra2024neuroplasticity} that show circuits only add some additional components after fine-tuning. Based on these observations, we develop a circuit-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, which assigns ranks to layers based on edge changes in the circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that our circuit-based LoRA algorithm achieves an average performance improvement of 2.46\% over standard LoRA with similar parameter sizes. Furthermore, we explore how combining circuits from subtasks can enhance fine-tuning in compositional tasks, providing new insights into the design of such tasks and deepening the understanding of circuit dynamics and fine-tuning mechanisms.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the mechanisms behind fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using circuit analysis, a mechanistic interpretability (MI) technique.  Unlike previous work focusing on tasks where pre-trained models already perform well, this study designs a set of challenging mathematical tasks where fine-tuning significantly improves performance.  The authors use circuit analysis to track changes in model circuits during fine-tuning.  They find that edge modifications are more significant than node changes, contrasting previous findings.  This observation leads to the development of CircuitLoRA, a modified Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method that prioritizes layers with more edge changes.  Experiments show CircuitLoRA achieves better accuracy and parameter efficiency than standard LoRA. Finally, they explore compositional tasks, finding that the union of subtask circuits can approximate the circuit for the combined task.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of LLM fine-tuning, but its novelty and significance are not groundbreaking.

**Strengths:**

* **Focus on challenging tasks:** The use of mathematical tasks where pre-trained models initially perform poorly is a crucial strength. This addresses a limitation of previous MI studies and provides a more realistic evaluation of fine-tuning mechanisms.
* **Novel CircuitLoRA method:** The proposed CircuitLoRA method offers a practical application of circuit analysis insights to improve fine-tuning efficiency. The empirical results demonstrate a performance improvement, suggesting a valuable contribution to parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques.
* **Exploration of compositional tasks:** The investigation into compositional tasks and the use of union circuits provides a new perspective on how circuits might interact and compose in complex scenarios.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited scope of tasks:** While the focus on challenging mathematical tasks is a strength, the scope remains limited.  Generalizing these findings to other types of tasks and datasets is crucial for broader impact.
* **Methodological limitations:** The reliance on a specific circuit identification method (EAP-IG) and the definition of "critical layers" might limit the generalizability of the findings.  Further investigation with different methods is needed.
* **Modest performance improvement:** While CircuitLoRA shows improvement over standard LoRA, the magnitude of the improvement (2.46% average) is relatively modest.  This raises questions about the practical significance of the proposed method in real-world applications.
* **Lack of theoretical justification:** The paper primarily relies on empirical observations. A more thorough theoretical analysis explaining *why* edge changes are so crucial during fine-tuning would significantly strengthen the contribution.

**Potential Influence:**

The paper could influence the MI community by highlighting the importance of considering task difficulty and the specific nature of circuit changes during fine-tuning.  CircuitLoRA, while showing modest improvement, suggests a potentially fruitful direction for improving parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. However, broader adoption will depend on further validation across more diverse tasks and datasets.


Score: 7

The score reflects the paper's valuable contributions in focusing on realistic fine-tuning scenarios and proposing a novel, albeit modestly impactful, method.  However, the limited scope, methodological limitations, and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The paper provides a good starting point for further research in this important area, but more work is needed to fully realize its potential.

- **Authors**: Hanbin Wang, Xiaoxuan Zhou, Zhipeng Xu, Keyuan Cheng, Yuxin Zuo, Kai Tian, Jingwei Song, Junting Lu, Wenhui Hu, Xueyang Liu
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces Code-Vision, a benchmark designed to evaluate the logical understanding and code generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). It challenges MLLMs to generate a correct program that fulfills specific functionality requirements based on a given flowchart, which visually represents the desired algorithm or process. Code-Vision comprises three subsets: HumanEval-V, Algorithm, and MATH, which evaluate MLLMs' coding abilities across basic programming, algorithmic, and mathematical problem-solving domains. Our experiments evaluate 12 MLLMs on Code-Vision. Experimental results demonstrate that there is a large performance difference between proprietary and open-source models. On Hard problems, GPT-4o can achieve 79.3% pass@1, but the best open-source model only achieves 15%. Further experiments reveal that Code-Vision can pose unique challenges compared to other multimodal reasoning benchmarks MMCode and MathVista. We also explore the reason for the poor performance of the open-source models. All data and codes are available at https://github.com/wanghanbinpanda/CodeVision.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces CODE-VISION, a benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  Unlike previous benchmarks that use images supplementarily, CODE-VISION uses flowcharts as the primary input, making visual understanding crucial for successful code generation.  The benchmark comprises three subsets (HumanEval-V, Algorithm, MATH) covering different problem domains and difficulty levels.  Experiments on 12 MLLMs (both proprietary and open-source) reveal a significant performance gap, with proprietary models like GPT-4 outperforming open-source models considerably, especially on harder problems.  The authors analyze error patterns, finding that open-source models struggle with basic syntax and code structure more than proprietary models.  Comparisons with MMCode and MathVista highlight CODE-VISION's unique challenges in assessing visual-based algorithmic reasoning.  The data and code are publicly available.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of MLLM evaluation.  The core novelty lies in the visual-centric design of CODE-VISION, forcing models to truly utilize visual information for code generation, rather than relying solely on textual cues as in many existing benchmarks. This addresses a significant limitation in previous work. The comprehensive evaluation across different problem domains and difficulty levels further strengthens the benchmark's utility.  The comparative analysis with other benchmarks reinforces the uniqueness and rigor of CODE-VISION.  The thorough error analysis provides insightful information about the strengths and weaknesses of different MLLM architectures.

However, some weaknesses exist. The dataset size, particularly for hard problems, is relatively small, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings.  The focus on code correctness neglects other important aspects of code quality like readability and efficiency.  The reliance on GPT-4 for flowchart generation introduces a potential bias.


Considering both the strengths and weaknesses, the paper makes a solid and impactful contribution to the field.  The novel benchmark is well-designed and rigorously evaluated, providing valuable insights into the current capabilities and limitations of MLLMs.  Its public availability further enhances its impact.  While improvements in dataset size and a broader assessment of code quality would strengthen the work further, the current contribution is substantial.

### Text Classification in the LLM Era - Where do we stand?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11830v1)
- **Authors**: Sowmya Vajjala, Shwetali Shimangaud
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models revolutionized NLP and showed dramatic performance improvements across several tasks. In this paper, we investigated the role of such language models in text classification and how they compare with other approaches relying on smaller pre-trained language models. Considering 32 datasets spanning 8 languages, we compared zero-shot classification, few-shot fine-tuning and synthetic data based classifiers with classifiers built using the complete human labeled dataset. Our results show that zero-shot approaches do well for sentiment classification, but are outperformed by other approaches for the rest of the tasks, and synthetic data sourced from multiple LLMs can build better classifiers than zero-shot open LLMs. We also see wide performance disparities across languages in all the classification scenarios. We expect that these findings would guide practitioners working on developing text classification systems across languages.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text classification across multiple languages and datasets, comparing zero-shot classification, few-shot fine-tuning, and synthetic data generation against classifiers trained on fully labeled data.  Using 32 datasets spanning 8 languages, the authors found that zero-shot approaches excel at sentiment classification but underperform on other tasks.  Synthetic data generated from multiple LLMs often outperforms zero-shot methods using open-source LLMs.  Significant performance disparities across languages were observed across all methods.  The study offers practical guidelines for practitioners choosing text classification methods, emphasizing the continued value of fully labeled data while highlighting the potential of few-shot learning and synthetic data generation as cost-effective alternatives.  Limitations include a focus on short texts and a limited exploration of prompt engineering and hyperparameter tuning.


**Rigorous Evaluation and Score Justification:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the rapidly evolving field of LLM-based text classification.  Its strength lies in its comprehensive comparison of different LLM-based approaches across multiple languages and diverse datasets. This multi-lingual and multi-task evaluation is a significant step forward compared to many previous studies focused solely on English. The findings regarding the effectiveness of synthetic data and the practical guidelines provided are useful for practitioners.  The inclusion of both open-source and proprietary LLMs allows for a nuanced comparison of their capabilities.

However, the paper has several weaknesses. The evaluation of different prompt engineering strategies is limited, and the impact of hyperparameter tuning on fine-tuning results isn't thoroughly explored. The reliance on a limited set of pre-trained multilingual models might restrict the generalizability of the findings. The qualitative analysis of results is absent, which could provide richer insights.  The discussion of potential data contamination from the pre-trained LLMs is somewhat superficial. While the authors acknowledge limitations, a deeper exploration of these issues would strengthen the conclusions. The novelty is incremental rather than revolutionary; it builds upon existing work, extending it to a broader linguistic context.

Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper represents a solid contribution to the field, providing valuable empirical evidence and practical guidance. However, the lack of deeper methodological exploration and the incremental nature of the novelty prevent it from being a groundbreaking contribution.

### Intuitive physics understanding emerges from self-supervised pretraining on natural videos
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11831v1)
- **Authors**: Quentin Garrido, Nicolas Ballas, Mahmoud Assran, Adrien Bardes, Laurent Najman, Michael Rabbat, Emmanuel Dupoux, Yann LeCun
- **Abstract**: We investigate the emergence of intuitive physics understanding in general-purpose deep neural network models trained to predict masked regions in natural videos. Leveraging the violation-of-expectation framework, we find that video prediction models trained to predict outcomes in a learned representation space demonstrate an understanding of various intuitive physics properties, such as object permanence and shape consistency. In contrast, video prediction in pixel space and multimodal large language models, which reason through text, achieve performance closer to chance. Our comparisons of these architectures reveal that jointly learning an abstract representation space while predicting missing parts of sensory input, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient to acquire an understanding of intuitive physics, and that even models trained on one week of unique video achieve above chance performance. This challenges the idea that core knowledge -- a set of innate systems to help understand the world -- needs to be hardwired to develop an understanding of intuitive physics.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the emergence of intuitive physics understanding in deep learning models.  The authors train a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), a self-supervised model that predicts masked regions in natural videos within a learned representation space.  Using a violation-of-expectation framework, they demonstrate that V-JEPA achieves significantly above-chance performance on several intuitive physics benchmarks (IntPhys, GRASP, InfLevel), outperforming pixel-based video prediction models and large language models (LLMs) which rely on text-based reasoning.  The success of V-JEPA suggests that learning an abstract representation space through video prediction, akin to predictive coding, is sufficient for acquiring intuitive physics understanding, challenging the "core knowledge" hypothesis that posits innate, hardwired mechanisms for this ability.  Ablation studies show that while model size and training data affect performance, V-JEPA's success is robust to variations in the specific prediction task and even achieves above-chance performance with limited training data (one week of unique video).  However, V-JEPA struggles with properties requiring complex object interactions, suggesting limitations in its current capacity.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of AI and cognitive science by demonstrating that intuitive physics understanding can emerge from self-supervised learning in a relatively simple architecture.  The use of the violation-of-expectation paradigm provides a rigorous methodology for evaluating intuitive physics understanding in AI models, and the comparison to other state-of-the-art models clearly establishes V-JEPA's superior performance. The ablation studies add valuable insights into the factors contributing to the model's success, highlighting the importance of learning in a representation space.  The findings challenge established theories in cognitive science, adding weight to the argument against the need for hard-coded core knowledge.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on existing benchmarks, while providing a solid comparison point, may not fully capture the nuances of human intuitive physics.  The limitations of V-JEPA in handling complex object interactions also need to be addressed in future research.  Furthermore, while the paper challenges the core knowledge hypothesis, it doesn't definitively refute it;  further investigation into the relationship between learned representations and innate biases is warranted. The high performance on IntPhys might also be partially attributable to the synthetic nature of the data, raising questions about generalizability to truly complex, real-world scenarios.


Considering the strengths and weaknesses, and its potential to inspire future research in both AI and cognitive science, the paper represents a substantial advancement.

### HAAN: A Holistic Approach for Accelerating Normalization Operations in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11832v1)
- **Authors**: Tianfan Peng, Jiajun Qin, Tianhua Xia, Sai Qian Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks by achieving state-of-the-art performance across a range of benchmarks. Central to the success of these models is the integration of sophisticated architectural components aimed at improving training stability, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Among these components, normalization operation, such as layer normalization (LayerNorm), emerges as a pivotal technique, offering substantial benefits to the overall model performance. However, previous studies have indicated that normalization operations can substantially elevate processing latency and energy usage. In this work, we adopt the principles of algorithm and hardware co-design, introducing a holistic normalization accelerating method named HAAN. The evaluation results demonstrate that HAAN can achieve significantly better hardware performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions.
- **Summary**: HAAN: A Holistic Approach for Accelerating Normalization Operations in Large Language Models proposes a hardware-software co-design approach to speed up LayerNorm and RMSNorm in LLMs.  The core idea is to exploit the statistical correlation between normalization statistics across consecutive layers.  This allows for skipping the computationally expensive variance calculation in later layers and predicting it based on earlier layers' statistics, combined with input subsampling and quantization to further reduce computational cost.  The authors present a hardware accelerator design utilizing fixed and floating-point arithmetic to implement this efficiently.  Experimental results show significant latency and power reduction compared to baseline methods, with minimal accuracy loss.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM acceleration, but its novelty and significance are not without limitations.

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a critical bottleneck:**  Layer normalization is a computationally expensive operation in LLMs, and the paper directly targets this bottleneck.  The focus on LayerNorm is important, as it's widely used in many successful LLMs.
* **Holistic approach:** The paper combines algorithmic optimizations (variance prediction, subsampling) with a tailored hardware design, a key strength for achieving substantial performance gains.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The authors provide a detailed evaluation across multiple LLMs, tasks, and hardware configurations, enhancing the credibility of their claims.  The inclusion of both accuracy and hardware performance metrics is crucial.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited novelty in individual components:** While the combination is valuable, individual techniques like subsampling and quantization are not entirely novel. The core idea of exploiting statistical correlation across layers, while useful, might not be groundbreaking.  The linear prediction for ISD is relatively simple.
* **Hardware-specific optimizations:**  The proposed hardware accelerator is tailored for a specific FPGA (Xilinx Alveo U280).  The performance gains may not directly translate to other hardware platforms.  A more generalizable approach or a detailed analysis of portability would strengthen the paper.
* **Comparison with limited baselines:** While the comparison with DFX, SOLE, and MHAA is helpful, a more exhaustive comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art LLM acceleration techniques would provide a more robust assessment of HAAN's performance.  The authors' claim of "significantly better hardware performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions" needs more concrete support.
* **Overly optimistic claims:**  Claims like a "significant reduction in processing latency" should be supported by more specific quantitative results.

**Potential Influence:**

The paper could influence the design of future LLM accelerators by highlighting the importance of addressing normalization operations.  The holistic approach combining algorithm and hardware design may inspire similar work targeting other computationally intensive operations in LLMs. However, its widespread impact hinges on the generalizability of its techniques beyond the specific hardware and models tested.


**Score: 7**

The paper presents a solid contribution to LLM acceleration with a well-executed combination of algorithmic and hardware optimizations.  However, the lack of complete novelty in the individual components, limitations in the breadth of comparison studies, and the hardware-specific nature of the design prevent it from being a truly groundbreaking contribution. The overall impact will depend on further research validating its performance and generalizability across different architectures and scenarios.

### Model Generalization on Text Attribute Graphs: Principles with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11836v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyu Wang, Shikun Liu, Rongzhe Wei, Pan Li
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been introduced to graph learning, aiming to extend their zero-shot generalization success to tasks where labeled graph data is scarce. Among these applications, inference over text-attributed graphs (TAGs) presents unique challenges: existing methods struggle with LLMs' limited context length for processing large node neighborhoods and the misalignment between node embeddings and the LLM token space. To address these issues, we establish two key principles for ensuring generalization and derive the framework LLM-BP accordingly: (1) Unifying the attribute space with task-adaptive embeddings, where we leverage LLM-based encoders and task-aware prompting to enhance generalization of the text attribute embeddings; (2) Developing a generalizable graph information aggregation mechanism, for which we adopt belief propagation with LLM-estimated parameters that adapt across graphs. Evaluations on 11 real-world TAG benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-BP significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 8.10% improvement with task-conditional embeddings and an additional 1.71% gain from adaptive aggregation.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes LLM-BP, a novel framework for zero-shot node classification on text-attributed graphs (TAGs).  LLM-BP leverages two key principles: 1)  creating task-adaptive node embeddings using LLM-based encoders and task-aware prompting, and 2)  developing a generalizable graph information aggregation mechanism based on belief propagation with LLM-estimated parameters.  Experiments on 11 real-world TAG benchmarks demonstrate that LLM-BP significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements attributed to both the task-adaptive embeddings and the adaptive aggregation mechanism.  The paper also highlights the limitations of existing approaches that attempt to align graph embeddings with LLM token spaces, finding that simpler methods using smaller LM encoders often perform better due to the scarcity of training data for effective alignment.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of graph learning, particularly in the context of zero-shot learning with limited labeled data.  The core idea of using LLMs to both generate task-adaptive embeddings and guide the graph aggregation process is innovative and addresses a critical challenge in the integration of LLMs and graph neural networks.  The extensive experimental evaluation across diverse datasets and baselines strongly supports the effectiveness of LLM-BP.  The finding that directly aligning graph embeddings with LLMs is often less effective than using smaller, pre-trained LM encoders is a significant observation that should guide future research.


However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on LLMs for homophily estimation introduces computational cost, and the approximation of belief propagation might limit accuracy in complex graph structures.  The paper's contribution would be strengthened by a more in-depth theoretical analysis of the proposed method and a comparison with more sophisticated graph aggregation techniques beyond simple neighborhood averaging. While the few-shot setting is addressed in the appendix, a more prominent discussion in the main body would enhance the impact.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's novelty in combining task-adaptive embedding with LLM-guided belief propagation, the thorough empirical validation, and the insightful comparison with existing approaches warrant a high score.  The findings on the limitations of embedding alignment with LLMs are especially valuable. The proposed method has the potential to influence the field by promoting the development of more robust and generalizable graph learning models.

### ChordFormer: A Conformer-Based Architecture for Large-Vocabulary Audio Chord Recognition
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11840v1)
- **Authors**: Muhammad Waseem Akram, Stefano Dettori, Valentina Colla, Giorgio Carlo Buttazzo
- **Abstract**: Chord recognition serves as a critical task in music information retrieval due to the abstract and descriptive nature of chords in music analysis. While audio chord recognition systems have achieved significant accuracy for small vocabularies (e.g., major/minor chords), large-vocabulary chord recognition remains a challenging problem. This complexity also arises from the inherent long-tail distribution of chords, where rare chord types are underrepresented in most datasets, leading to insufficient training samples. Effective chord recognition requires leveraging contextual information from audio sequences, yet existing models, such as combinations of convolutional neural networks, bidirectional long short-term memory networks, and bidirectional transformers, face limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and exhibit suboptimal performance on large-vocabulary chord recognition tasks. This work proposes ChordFormer, a novel conformer-based architecture designed to tackle structural chord recognition (e.g., triads, bass, sevenths) for large vocabularies. ChordFormer leverages conformer blocks that integrate convolutional neural networks with transformers, thus enabling the model to capture both local patterns and global dependencies effectively. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance through a reweighted loss function and structured chord representations, ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 2% improvement in frame-wise accuracy and a 6% increase in class-wise accuracy on large-vocabulary chord datasets. Furthermore, ChordFormer excels in handling class imbalance, providing robust and balanced recognition across chord types. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical music knowledge and practical applications, advancing the field of large-vocabulary chord recognition.
- **Summary**: ChordFormer is a novel conformer-based architecture for large-vocabulary audio chord recognition.  It addresses the challenges of long-term dependencies in chord sequences and class imbalance in chord datasets.  The model combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transformers using conformer blocks to effectively capture both local and global dependencies.  A reweighted loss function mitigates the effects of class imbalance, and a structured chord representation improves interpretability and performance.  Experiments on a large dataset show ChordFormer outperforms state-of-the-art models in frame-wise and class-wise accuracy.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of automatic chord recognition (ACR), but its novelty and significance aren't groundbreaking.  Several aspects warrant a critical evaluation:

**Strengths:**

* **Effective Combination of Architectures:**  The integration of conformers, which combine CNNs and transformers, is a clever approach to capture both local and global features within audio sequences. This is a clear strength, and the results support the efficacy of this architectural choice.
* **Addressing Class Imbalance:** The use of a reweighted loss function directly addresses a persistent challenge in ACR, where some chord types are far more frequent than others.  The experimental results demonstrating improvement due to re-weighting are significant.
* **Structured Chord Representation:** Using a structured representation of chord labels, aligning with music theory, improves the model's interpretability and potentially its generalizability.  This is a positive contribution towards making ACR systems more musically meaningful.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper employs multiple evaluation metrics and compares against a range of baseline models, which strengthens the credibility of the results.  The use of the mir_eval library further enhances the reproducibility of their work.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Incremental Novelty:** While the combination of conformers and the re-weighted loss function is effective, it's not a radically new approach.  Both techniques have been used in other domains, and their application to ACR, though well-executed, doesn't constitute a paradigm shift.
* **Limited Analysis of Hyperparameters:**  While the paper mentions hyperparameter tuning, a more in-depth analysis of the sensitivity of the results to hyperparameter choices would strengthen the claims of robustness.
* **Dataset Limitations:** The reliance on a single, albeit well-established, dataset limits the generalizability of the findings.  Evaluating performance on other datasets with different characteristics (e.g., different genres, recording quality) would be beneficial.
* **Lack of Ablation Study:**  A more thorough ablation study would be beneficial, isolating the contribution of each component (conformers, re-weighted loss, structured representation) to the overall performance improvement.  This would help clarify the relative importance of each contribution.


**Overall Significance:**

The paper makes a solid contribution to the field, showing that a well-designed and implemented model can improve the accuracy of large-vocabulary ACR.  However, the novelty is incremental rather than revolutionary. The impact will likely be felt primarily through the adoption of the ChordFormer architecture and techniques within the ACR community, leading to improved performance of existing systems.  The work is well-executed, and the findings are clearly presented, but it lacks the truly groundbreaking nature needed for a higher score.

### Can LLM Agents Maintain a Persona in Discourse?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11843v1)
- **Authors**: Pranav Bhandari, Nicolas Fay, Michael Wise, Amitava Datta, Stephanie Meek, Usman Naseem, Mehwish Nasim
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as conversational agents, exploiting their capabilities in various sectors such as education, law, medicine, and more. However, LLMs are often subjected to context-shifting behaviour, resulting in a lack of consistent and interpretable personality-aligned interactions. Adherence to psychological traits lacks comprehensive analysis, especially in the case of dyadic (pairwise) conversations. We examine this challenge from two viewpoints, initially using two conversation agents to generate a discourse on a certain topic with an assigned personality from the OCEAN framework (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) as High/Low for each trait. This is followed by using multiple judge agents to infer the original traits assigned to explore prediction consistency, inter-model agreement, and alignment with the assigned personality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can be guided toward personality-driven dialogue, their ability to maintain personality traits varies significantly depending on the combination of models and discourse settings. These inconsistencies emphasise the challenges in achieving stable and interpretable personality-aligned interactions in LLMs.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to consistently maintain assigned personality traits (from the OCEAN framework) during dyadic conversations.  The authors designed an agent-based system where two LLMs, each assigned a specific personality profile, engage in a debate on a given topic.  Independent judge LLMs then assess the generated dialogue to determine the alignment between expressed and assigned traits.  Results show that while LLMs can be prompted to exhibit personality traits, their ability to maintain these traits consistently varies significantly depending on the model combinations and discourse settings.  The study uses several metrics, including accuracy of trait prediction, inter-rater reliability among judge models (using Fleiss' Kappa), and discourse alignment with assigned traits (using LIWC analysis).  The findings highlight the challenges in achieving stable and interpretable personality-aligned interactions in LLMs, suggesting that further research is needed to improve consistency and develop more robust evaluation methods.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper tackles a significant and timely problem: the consistency and reliability of personality expression in LLMs, a crucial aspect for developing believable and trustworthy conversational agents. The agent-based evaluation framework is a novel approach, moving beyond simple single-turn persona evaluations towards a more realistic, dynamic conversational context.  The use of multiple judge LLMs to assess consistency adds another layer of methodological sophistication.  The paperâ€™s use of multiple LLMs and the inclusion of LIWC analysis for linguistic analysis is also a strength.

However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall impact.  The reliance on specific, readily available LLM models limits the generalizability of the findings. The inconsistent performance of some models (like DeepSeek) raises questions about the robustness of the methodology and the reliability of the results.  Furthermore, the paper lacks a clear theoretical framework grounding the study's approach to personality and its measurement. The explanation of the prompt engineering process could be improved, and a deeper exploration of the influence of different prompt designs on the results would strengthen the study. While the paper identifies limitations, a more detailed discussion of potential biases inherent in both LLM generation and evaluation would be beneficial.  The paper also does not provide enough discussion or analysis into *why* the observed inconsistencies occur.

While the methodology is a step forward, the relatively limited scale of the study and the inconsistent performance of some models prevent it from making a groundbreaking contribution. The insights are valuable but not transformative.

Score: 6

**Rationale:**  The paper addresses an important problem and introduces a novel methodology.  However, limitations in generalizability, robustness of results, and a lack of deeper theoretical grounding prevent it from achieving a higher score. The contributions are significant but not yet a major breakthrough in the field. The findings provide useful insights and will likely motivate further research into this challenging area, but the current paper does not provide a fully comprehensive or conclusive answer.

### BaxBench: Can LLMs Generate Correct and Secure Backends?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11844v1)
- **Authors**: Mark Vero, Niels MÃ¼ndler, Victor Chibotaru, Veselin Raychev, Maximilian Baader, Nikola JovanoviÄ‡, Jingxuan He, Martin Vechev
- **Abstract**: The automatic generation of programs has long been a fundamental challenge in computer science. Recent benchmarks have shown that large language models (LLMs) can effectively generate code at the function level, make code edits, and solve algorithmic coding tasks. However, to achieve full automation, LLMs should be able to generate production-quality, self-contained application modules. To evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in solving this challenge, we introduce BaxBench, a novel evaluation benchmark consisting of 392 tasks for the generation of backend applications. We focus on backends for three critical reasons: (i) they are practically relevant, building the core components of most modern web and cloud software, (ii) they are difficult to get right, requiring multiple functions and files to achieve the desired functionality, and (iii) they are security-critical, as they are exposed to untrusted third-parties, making secure solutions that prevent deployment-time attacks an imperative. BaxBench validates the functionality of the generated applications with comprehensive test cases, and assesses their security exposure by executing end-to-end exploits. Our experiments reveal key limitations of current LLMs in both functionality and security: (i) even the best model, OpenAI o1, achieves a mere 60% on code correctness; (ii) on average, we could successfully execute security exploits on more than half of the correct programs generated by each LLM; and (iii) in less popular backend frameworks, models further struggle to generate correct and secure applications. Progress on BaxBench signifies important steps towards autonomous and secure software development with LLMs.
- **Summary**: BaxBench is a new benchmark for evaluating the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate correct and secure backend applications.  Unlike previous benchmarks focusing on function-level code or algorithmic tasks, BaxBench assesses the generation of complete, multi-file backend applications across 14 frameworks in 6 programming languages (392 tasks total).  The benchmark evaluates both functional correctness using comprehensive test cases and security robustness by attempting to exploit common vulnerabilities (CWEs).  Results show that even top-performing LLMs struggle, achieving only around 60% correctness and significantly lower rates of both correctness and security.  The authors also investigated the impact of security-specific prompts and framework choice on performance, finding that both significantly affect the results.  They conclude that LLMs are not yet ready for autonomous, production-ready code generation, highlighting the critical need for secure code generation capabilities.


**Novelty and Significance:**

BaxBench makes a significant contribution by addressing a crucial gap in LLM code generation benchmarking.  The focus on complete, deployable backend applications, incorporating both functional correctness and security evaluations, is a substantial advancement over existing benchmarks that typically focus on smaller, isolated code snippets.  The use of real-world security exploits, rather than solely relying on static analysis, provides a more realistic and practical assessment of security vulnerabilities.  The comprehensive dataset, covering multiple frameworks and programming languages, enhances the benchmark's generalizability and usefulness.

However, the paper's novelty could be strengthened by a more detailed comparison with related work in security testing. While the authors mention several benchmarks, a more in-depth analysis of how BaxBench differentiates itself beyond the scope and scale would improve the argument for novelty.  Furthermore, the impact of the chosen CWEs on the overall security assessment needs further discussion; are these CWEs representative of the most prevalent vulnerabilities in real-world backends?

The benchmark's significance lies in its potential to drive future research and development in LLM-based code generation.  By providing a challenging and realistic evaluation framework, BaxBench can help researchers identify and address critical limitations in current LLMs and guide the development of more robust and secure code generation techniques. The public availability of the benchmark will further contribute to its widespread impact on the community.


**Score: 8**

The score reflects the significant advancement BaxBench represents in LLM evaluation, particularly its focus on a realistic and challenging scenarioâ€”complete backend generationâ€”and its inclusion of both functional and security testing using real-world exploits.  However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison to related work and a more thorough justification of the selection of CWEs to further solidify its claims of novelty and maximize its impact on the field.

### StructTransform: A Scalable Attack Surface for Safety-Aligned Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11853v1)
- **Authors**: Shehel Yoosuf, Temoor Ali, Ahmed Lekssays, Mashael AlSabah, Issa Khalil
- **Abstract**: In this work, we present a series of structure transformation attacks on LLM alignment, where we encode natural language intent using diverse syntax spaces, ranging from simple structure formats and basic query languages (e.g. SQL) to new novel spaces and syntaxes created entirely by LLMs. Our extensive evaluation shows that our simplest attacks can achieve close to 90% success rate, even on strict LLMs (such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet) using SOTA alignment mechanisms. We improve the attack performance further by using an adaptive scheme that combines structure transformations along with existing \textit{content transformations}, resulting in over 96% ASR with 0% refusals. To generalize our attacks, we explore numerous structure formats, including syntaxes purely generated by LLMs. Our results indicate that such novel syntaxes are easy to generate and result in a high ASR, suggesting that defending against our attacks is not a straightforward process. Finally, we develop a benchmark and evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses against it, showing that most of them fail with 100% ASR. Our results show that existing safety alignment mostly relies on token-level patterns without recognizing harmful concepts, highlighting and motivating the need for serious research efforts in this direction. As a case study, we demonstrate how attackers can use our attack to easily generate a sample malware, and a corpus of fraudulent SMS messages, which perform well in bypassing detection.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces StructTransform, a novel attack framework targeting the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs).  Instead of relying on traditional content-based adversarial prompting (e.g., rephrasing, encoding), StructTransform leverages *structure transformations*, encoding malicious intent within diverse syntax spaces like SQL, JSON, and even LLM-generated novel syntaxes.  The authors demonstrate that even simple structure transformations achieve high attack success rates (ASR), often exceeding 90%, even against robust LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet.  Combining structure transformations with existing content transformations further boosts ASR to over 96% with zero refusals.  The study also shows that LLMs can easily generate novel, effective syntaxes, highlighting the vast and rapidly expanding attack surface.  A benchmark, StructTransform Bench, is developed to evaluate existing safety-alignment defenses, revealing their significant weaknesses and dependence on token-level patterns rather than conceptual understanding of harm.  Case studies illustrate the practical threat of generating malware and fraudulent SMS messages using these techniques.  The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for fundamental changes in LLM safety alignment, moving beyond surface-level pattern matching to a more robust, concept-based approach.


**Novelty and Significance Evaluation:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of LLM safety and security. The core idea of using *structure transformations* to bypass safety mechanisms is novel and highly relevant given the increasing sophistication and capabilities of LLMs. The extensive evaluation across diverse models and the development of a dedicated benchmark are substantial strengths.  The demonstration of the practical implications through malware and phishing examples strengthens the paper's impact.

However, the paper has some weaknesses. While the concept is strong, the methodology for generating novel syntaxes could be more rigorous.  The reliance on LLMs for both attack generation and evaluation introduces potential biases and limitations, which are acknowledged but not fully addressed.  The detailed description of the attacks might inadvertently aid malicious actors.

Despite these weaknesses, the paper's findings are compelling and have significant implications for the future of LLM safety research.  The work compels a shift in thinking about LLM alignment, moving towards more robust defenses that understand the *intent* behind prompts rather than simply relying on superficial pattern matching.  The introduction of the StructTransform Bench is also a valuable contribution to the community.

### Defining and Evaluating Visual Language Models' Basic Spatial Abilities: A Perspective from Psychometrics
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11859v1)
- **Authors**: Wenrui Xu, Dalin Lyu, Weihang Wang, Jie Feng, Chen Gao, Yong Li
- **Abstract**: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences underscores the hierarchical nature of cognitive capabilities. To advance Spatial Artificial Intelligence, we pioneer a psychometric framework defining five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) in Visual Language Models (VLMs): Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization. Benchmarking 13 mainstream VLMs through nine validated psychometric experiments reveals significant gaps versus humans (average score 24.95 vs. 68.38), with three key findings: 1) VLMs mirror human hierarchies (strongest in 2D orientation, weakest in 3D rotation) with independent BSAs (Pearson's r<0.4); 2) Smaller models such as Qwen2-VL-7B surpass larger counterparts, with Qwen leading (30.82) and InternVL2 lagging (19.6); 3) Interventions like chain-of-thought (0.100 accuracy gain) and 5-shot training (0.259 improvement) show limits from architectural constraints. Identified barriers include weak geometry encoding and missing dynamic simulation. By linking psychometric BSAs to VLM capabilities, we provide a diagnostic toolkit for spatial intelligence evaluation, methodological foundations for embodied AI development, and a cognitive science-informed roadmap for achieving human-like spatial intelligence.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a psychometric framework for evaluating the spatial reasoning abilities of Visual Language Models (VLMs).  It defines five Basic Spatial Abilities (BSAs) â€“ Spatial Perception, Spatial Relation, Spatial Orientation, Mental Rotation, and Spatial Visualization â€“ based on existing psychometric theories of human intelligence.  Thirteen mainstream VLMs were tested using nine established psychometric tests, comparing their performance to human baselines.  Key findings include a significant performance gap between VLMs and humans, a mirroring of human performance hierarchies across BSAs (stronger in 2D, weaker in 3D), and a surprising lack of correlation between model size and spatial reasoning ability.  Smaller models sometimes outperformed larger ones. Interventions like chain-of-thought prompting and few-shot learning offered limited improvements, revealing architectural limitations in VLMs' ability to handle dynamic 3D spatial reasoning and geometric encoding.  The authors suggest that future advancements require hybrid architectures incorporating geometric priors and neurosymbolic reasoning.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution by applying a rigorous psychometric framework to the evaluation of VLMs' spatial abilities, a significant gap in current research. The use of established human spatial tests provides a much-needed standardized benchmark for comparing different models and allows for a more meaningful interpretation of results than previous, ad-hoc evaluations.  The identification of performance hierarchies mirroring those in humans is insightful and suggests potential avenues for future model development.  The finding that smaller models sometimes outperform larger ones is intriguing and challenges common assumptions in the field, prompting further investigation into architectural design.

However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall impact.  The reliance on existing, potentially culturally biased, human spatial tests without significant adaptation for VLMs introduces limitations. While the authors acknowledge potential limitations of API usage, the indirect evaluation of models through APIs could introduce biases stemming from API limitations or inconsistencies. The interventions (CoT and few-shot learning) while showing improvement, yielded only modest gains, suggesting that more fundamental architectural changes are necessary, and that these interventions might be insufficient alone.  Furthermore, while the paper highlights architectural limitations, it doesn't offer concrete proposals for novel architectures beyond general suggestions.

The paper's novelty lies in its systematic and comprehensive approach to evaluating VLM spatial abilities using a psychometric lens.  Its significance stems from the identification of key limitations in current VLMs and the establishment of a benchmark for future research. However, the limited impact of the proposed interventions and the lack of concrete architectural solutions slightly diminish its overall impact.  The findings warrant further investigation and inspire future research, but they don't represent a complete breakthrough.

- **Authors**: Shuqi Yang, Mingrui Jing, Shuai Wang, Jiaxin Kou, Manfei Shi, Weijie Xing, Yan Hu, Zheng Zhu
- **Abstract**: This study reviewed the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, focusing on their training corpora, customization techniques, and evaluation metrics. A systematic search of studies from 2021 to 2024 identified 61 articles. Four types of corpora were used: clinical resources, literature, open-source datasets, and web-crawled data. Common construction techniques included pre-training, prompt engineering, and retrieval-augmented generation, with 44 studies combining multiple methods. Evaluation metrics were categorized into process, usability, and outcome metrics, with outcome metrics divided into model-based and expert-assessed outcomes. The study identified critical gaps in corpus fairness, which contributed to biases from geographic, cultural, and socio-economic factors. The reliance on unverified or unstructured data highlighted the need for better integration of evidence-based clinical guidelines. Future research should focus on developing a tiered corpus architecture with vetted sources and dynamic weighting, while ensuring model transparency. Additionally, the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for domain-specific models called for comprehensive validation of LLMs in real-world healthcare settings.
- **Summary**: This paper reviews 61 studies (2021-2024) applying Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, focusing on their training corpora, customization techniques, and evaluation metrics.  The authors categorize corpus sources into four types: real-world clinical resources, literature materials, open-source datasets, and web-crawled data, noting that most studies used multiple sources.  Customization techniques included pre-training, prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), fine-tuning, in-context learning, and offline learning.  Evaluation metrics were classified into process metrics, usability metrics, and outcome metrics (model-based and expert-assessed).  The paper highlights significant gaps: bias in corpora due to geographic and socio-economic factors, reliance on unverified data, and a lack of standardized evaluation frameworks.  It calls for a tiered corpus architecture with vetted sources and dynamic weighting, improved transparency, and more comprehensive, multidimensional evaluation incorporating clinical applicability and addressing hallucinations.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution by systematically reviewing the current state of LLM application in healthcare.  The comprehensive analysis of data sources, customization methods, and evaluation metrics provides a much-needed overview of the field's current practices and limitations. The identification of biases in corpora and the lack of standardized evaluation are crucial observations.  The suggestions for future research, such as a tiered corpus architecture and more comprehensive evaluation frameworks, are well-reasoned and practical.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited. While the systematic review is thorough, it's largely a descriptive synthesis of existing literature rather than presenting groundbreaking new methodologies or findings.  The identified limitations are not surprising to those actively involved in the field, although highlighting them for a broader audience is beneficial. The paper lacks a deep dive into the specific performance differences observed between various approaches, focusing more on categorization than comparative analysis.

Furthermore, while the call for better data and evaluation is important, the paper doesn't offer concrete solutions beyond broad recommendations.  A more in-depth discussion of specific strategies for mitigating bias and hallucinations would strengthen the paper's impact.

Considering its strengths and weaknesses, the paper presents a valuable resource for researchers entering the field and provides a useful summary of existing work.  However, its originality and methodological depth don't warrant a top score.

### Understanding In-Context Machine Translation for Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Manchu
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11862v1)
- **Authors**: Renhao Pei, Yihong Liu, Peiqin Lin, FranÃ§ois Yvon, Hinrich SchÃ¼tze
- **Abstract**: In-context machine translation (MT) with large language models (LLMs) is a promising approach for low-resource MT, as it can readily take advantage of linguistic resources such as grammar books and dictionaries. Such resources are usually selectively integrated into the prompt so that LLMs can directly perform translation without any specific training, via their in-context learning capability (ICL). However, the relative importance of each type of resource e.g., dictionary, grammar book, and retrieved parallel examples, is not entirely clear. To address this gap, this study systematically investigates how each resource and its quality affects the translation performance, with the Manchu language as our case study. To remove any prior knowledge of Manchu encoded in the LLM parameters and single out the effect of ICL, we also experiment with an encrypted version of Manchu texts. Our results indicate that high-quality dictionaries and good parallel examples are very helpful, while grammars hardly help. In a follow-up study, we showcase a promising application of in-context MT: parallel data augmentation as a way to bootstrap the conventional MT model. When monolingual data abound, generating synthetic parallel data through in-context MT offers a pathway to mitigate data scarcity and build effective and efficient low-resource neural MT systems.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates in-context machine translation (MT) for low-resource languages, using Manchu as a case study.  The authors systematically explore the impact of various linguistic resources (dictionaries, parallel examples, grammar books, Chain-of-Thought prompting) on translation performance using several large language models (LLMs).  They find that high-quality dictionaries and closely related parallel examples significantly improve translation, while grammar books offer minimal benefit.  Using character-level encryption of Manchu text, they demonstrate that LLMs primarily rely on in-context learning rather than pre-existing Manchu knowledge. Finally, they show that in-context MT can effectively augment parallel data for training conventional NMT models, leading to substantial performance gains for Manchu-to-English translation.


**Novelty and Significance:**

The paper makes several contributions. The systematic investigation into the relative importance of different linguistic resources within the in-context learning framework is a valuable contribution. The use of character-level encryption to isolate in-context learning from pre-existing LLM knowledge is a novel methodological approach.  Demonstrating the effectiveness of in-context MT for data augmentation in low-resource settings is also significant.

However, the paper's limitations need to be considered. The focus on a single language (Manchu) limits the generalizability of the findings.  The relatively low BLEU scores achieved even with the best settings suggest limitations in the current state of in-context MT for low-resource languages. The findings regarding the ineffectiveness of grammar might be specific to the chosen grammar format and the way it was incorporated into the prompt.

While the paper presents valuable insights and methodological advancements, the impact might be somewhat limited due to the single-language focus and the inherent limitations of in-context MT.  The data augmentation approach is promising, but its effectiveness might vary depending on the language and the quality of the monolingual corpus.

Score: 7

Rationale: The paper demonstrates a solid methodological approach and presents valuable findings concerning the effectiveness of various resources in in-context MT. The data augmentation application shows potential. However, the limited scope (single language) and the relatively low translation quality achieved, even with the best settings, prevent a higher score.  Further research replicating these findings across diverse languages and exploring more sophisticated ways to integrate grammatical knowledge would greatly enhance the impact of this work.

### FedEAT: A Robustness Optimization Framework for Federated LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11863v1)
- **Authors**: Yahao Pang, Xingyuan Wu, Xiaojin Zhang, Wei Chen, Hai Jin
- **Abstract**: Significant advancements have been made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domains of natural language understanding and automated content creation. However, they still face persistent problems, including substantial computational costs and inadequate availability of training data. The combination of Federated Learning (FL) and LLMs (federated LLMs) offers a solution by leveraging distributed data while protecting privacy, which positions it as an ideal choice for sensitive domains. However, Federated LLMs still suffer from robustness challenges, including data heterogeneity, malicious clients, and adversarial attacks, which greatly hinder their applications. We first introduce the robustness problems in federated LLMs, to address these challenges, we propose FedEAT (Federated Embedding space Adversarial Training), a novel framework that applies adversarial training in the embedding space of client LLM and employs a robust aggregation approach, specifically geometric median aggregation, to enhance the robustness of Federated LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate that FedEAT effectively improves the robustness of Federated LLMs with minimal performance loss.
- **Summary**: FedEAT is a novel framework designed to enhance the robustness of Federated Large Language Models (LLMs).  It addresses the inherent robustness challenges in both Federated Learning (FL) and LLMs by employing two key strategies: 1) adversarial training in the embedding space of client LLMs, and 2) geometric median aggregation of client model updates.  The paper argues that adversarial training in the embedding space is computationally more efficient than in the input space.  Geometric median aggregation is used to mitigate the effects of malicious or noisy client updates. Experiments show that FedEAT improves robustness against adversarial attacks with minimal performance loss compared to standard federated averaging (FedAvg). Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of both adversarial training and robust aggregation.

**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the emerging field of federated LLMs, a domain currently lacking robust solutions. The combination of adversarial training in the embedding space and geometric median aggregation represents a novel approach to address the specific robustness challenges faced by this type of model. The experimental results provide supporting evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, several aspects limit the paper's overall impact:

* **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The evaluation is conducted on a relatively limited set of models and datasets.  A more comprehensive evaluation with diverse LLMs and larger, more varied datasets would significantly strengthen the claims. The reliance on a single adversarial attack method also restricts the generality of the findings.

* **Lack of Detailed Analysis of Computational Overhead:** While the paper mentions computational efficiency, a detailed comparison of the computational overhead of FedEAT versus FedAvg (or other robust aggregation methods) is missing. This is a crucial aspect, given the computational constraints inherent in federated learning.

* **Comparison with Other Robust FL Techniques:** The paper doesn't explicitly compare FedEAT with other existing robust federated learning techniques that could be applied to LLMs. This omission weakens the argument for the unique contribution of the proposed framework.  A comprehensive comparison would provide a better context for the novelty and significance of FedEAT.

* **Adversarial Examples:** The paper doesn't fully explain the methodology behind generating adversarial examples, especially within the embedding space.  More details on this process are needed for reproducibility and to assess the strength of the adversarial attacks used in the evaluation.


Despite these limitations, the core idea of combining embedding-space adversarial training with robust aggregation is promising and could influence future research in federated LLMs.  The paper provides a solid foundation for further investigation, but more rigorous validation and a broader comparison to existing methods are necessary to solidify its impact.

### JoLT: Joint Probabilistic Predictions on Tabular Data Using LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11877v1)
- **Authors**: Aliaksandra Shysheya, John Bronskill, James Requeima, Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, Javier Gonzalez, David Duvenaud, Richard E. Turner
- **Abstract**: We introduce a simple method for probabilistic predictions on tabular data based on Large Language Models (LLMs) called JoLT (Joint LLM Process for Tabular data). JoLT uses the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to define joint distributions over tabular data conditioned on user-specified side information about the problem, exploiting the vast repository of latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs. JoLT defines joint distributions for multiple target variables with potentially heterogeneous data types without any data conversion, data preprocessing, special handling of missing data, or model training, making it accessible and efficient for practitioners. Our experiments show that JoLT outperforms competitive methods on low-shot single-target and multi-target tabular classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we show that JoLT can automatically handle missing data and perform data imputation by leveraging textual side information. We argue that due to its simplicity and generality, JoLT is an effective approach for a wide variety of real prediction problems.
- **Summary**: JoLT (Joint LLM Process for Tabular data) is a novel method for probabilistic predictions on tabular data using Large Language Models (LLMs).  It leverages LLMs' in-context learning capabilities to define joint distributions over multiple target variables with heterogeneous data types.  A key advantage is its simplicity: JoLT requires no model training, data preprocessing (including imputation), or specialized handling of missing data.  Experiments demonstrate JoLT outperforms competitive methods in low-shot single and multi-target tasks, effectively handling missing data and leveraging textual side information for improved performance, even for data imputation.  However, JoLT's computational cost is higher than some baselines and scalability to large tables is limited by LLM context window size.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

**Novelty:** JoLT's novelty lies in its unique combination of features:  using LLMs for *joint* probabilistic prediction on tabular data with *heterogeneous* types and *automatic* missing data handling, all within a low-shot in-context learning framework. While LLMs have been applied to tabular data before, JoLT's unified approach to joint probability estimation, heterogeneous data, and missing data treatment without explicit imputation is a significant advance.  However, the core idea of using LLMs for in-context prediction is not entirely novel;  TabLLM and TabPFN already explored this.  JoLT's innovation lies in its specific combination and the comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios.

**Significance:** The potential impact is considerable.  The simplicity and ease of use could significantly democratize probabilistic modeling for practitioners lacking deep machine learning expertise.  The ability to handle mixed data types and missing data directly reduces the preprocessing burden, saving time and resources.  The strong empirical results, especially in low-shot scenarios, further support its practical value.  However, the computational cost and scalability limitations represent significant constraints.  The reliance on open-source LLMs, while making the approach more accessible, also limits its potential performance compared to what could be achieved using proprietary, more powerful models.  The reliance on the autoregressive nature of the LLM for defining joint distributions introduces order dependence in the predictions, a limitation not adequately addressed.

**Strengths:** Simplicity, ease of use, handling heterogeneous data and missing data without preprocessing, strong low-shot performance, effective utilization of side information.

**Weaknesses:** High computational cost, limited scalability to large datasets, order dependence in joint distribution estimation, reliance on LLM capabilities and biases.


Considering both novelty and significance, while acknowledging its limitations, JoLT represents a valuable contribution to the field. The unique combination of features addresses a practical need and demonstrates promising results, justifying a high score.

### Bitnet.cpp: Efficient Edge Inference for Ternary LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11880v1)
- **Authors**: Jinheng Wang, Hansong Zhou, Ting Song, Shijie Cao, Yan Xia, Ting Cao, Jianyu Wei, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Furu Wei
- **Abstract**: The advent of 1-bit large language models (LLMs), led by BitNet b1.58, has spurred interest in ternary LLMs. Despite this, research and practical applications focusing on efficient edge inference for ternary LLMs remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system optimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs, Bitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate sub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features two core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S), which ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our experiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new benchmarks in the field. Additionally, we expand TL to element-wise lookup table (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs in the appendix, presenting both theoretical and empirical evidence of its considerable potential. Bitnet.cpp is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/tree/paper , offering a sophisticated solution for the efficient and practical deployment of edge LLMs.
- **Summary**: Bitnet.cpp is an inference system designed for efficient edge deployment of ternary Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly BitNet b1.58.  It addresses the challenges of efficient mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) inherent in ternary LLMs (weights quantized to approximately 1.58 bits per weight).  The core innovation lies in a novel mpGEMM library featuring two key components: Ternary Lookup Table (TL) and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S). TL improves spatial efficiency over previous bit-wise methods, while I2_S ensures lossless inference for BitNet b1.58 by aligning with its training scheme.  Experiments demonstrate significant speed improvements (up to 6.25x over full-precision baselines and 2.32x over low-bit baselines) across various devices and model sizes. The paper also extends TL to a more general Element-wise Lookup Table (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs, providing theoretical and empirical evidence of its potential.  The code is publicly available.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of efficient LLM inference, particularly focusing on the under-explored area of ternary LLMs. The proposed Bitnet.cpp system, with its novel mpGEMM library, demonstrably improves inference speed on edge devices. The inclusion of both TL and I2_S addresses different aspects of the problemâ€”spatial efficiency and lossless inferenceâ€”making the solution more comprehensive. The extension of TL to ELUT broadens the applicability beyond ternary LLMs. The empirical results are compelling, showing substantial speedups over various baselines.

However, the paper's novelty is not entirely groundbreaking. The underlying concept of using lookup tables for efficient computation is not new.  The key contribution lies in the specific design choices within the TL and I2_S kernels, tailored to the specifics of ternary LLMs and the BitNet b1.58 training scheme.  The claim of "lossless inference" needs further scrutiny; while the paper demonstrates negligible loss, the definition of "lossless" in this context warrants clarification considering the inherent approximations in quantization.  Furthermore, the analysis of ELUT's potential focuses heavily on theoretical complexity and is only partially validated by empirical results. A more thorough investigation into its limitations and comparison with other advanced quantization techniques is needed to solidify its claim as a truly impactful generalization.  Finally, the limitations section acknowledges some crucial shortcomings, such as the current focus solely on ternary LLMs and a lack of detailed analysis on pre-filling stage optimization.

Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper represents a significant advancement in its niche but doesn't revolutionize the broader field.  The practical improvements presented are substantial and could influence the deployment of ternary LLMs.  However, the lack of broader generalization and some methodological limitations prevent it from achieving a higher score.

### Hypothesis-Driven Theory-of-Mind Reasoning for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11881v1)
- **Authors**: Hyunwoo Kim, Melanie Sclar, Tan Zhi-Xuan, Lance Ying, Sydney Levine, Yang Liu, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Yejin Choi
- **Abstract**: Existing LLM reasoning methods have shown impressive capabilities across various tasks, such as solving math and coding problems. However, applying these methods to scenarios without ground-truth answers or rule-based verification methods - such as tracking the mental states of an agent - remains challenging. Inspired by the sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, we introduce thought-tracing, an inference-time reasoning algorithm designed to trace the mental states of specific agents by generating hypotheses and weighting them based on observations without relying on ground-truth solutions to questions in datasets. Our algorithm is modeled after the Bayesian theory-of-mind framework, using LLMs to approximate probabilistic inference over agents' evolving mental states based on their perceptions and actions. We evaluate thought-tracing on diverse theory-of-mind benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to baseline LLMs. Our experiments also reveal interesting behaviors of the recent reasoning models - e.g., o1 and R1 - on theory-of-mind, highlighting the difference of social reasoning compared to other domains.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces "thought-tracing," a novel inference-time reasoning algorithm for Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to infer and track the mental states of agents in open-ended text.  Inspired by the Bayesian Theory of Mind framework and Sequential Monte Carlo methods, thought-tracing generates and weights multiple hypotheses about an agent's mental states based on their perceptions and actions, using the LLM itself for both hypothesis generation and weighting.  The algorithm doesn't rely on ground-truth answers or benchmark-specific assumptions.  Evaluated on four theory-of-mind benchmarks, thought-tracing consistently improves the performance of various LLMs, outperforming existing reasoning models in many cases, and highlighting the unique challenges of social reasoning compared to tasks like math and coding.  Ablation studies demonstrate the importance of perception inference and action likelihood weighting within the algorithm.  The paper also analyzes the behavior of existing reasoning models on theory-of-mind tasks, revealing unexpected performance patterns and a lack of correlation between reasoning effort and accuracy.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of LLM reasoning, particularly in the challenging area of theory-of-mind.  The core idea of using LLMs to iteratively generate and weight hypotheses about an agent's mental state, mirroring Bayesian Theory of Mind, is innovative.  The application of SMC principles to this problem is a clever approach to handling the inherent uncertainty.  The empirical evaluation is thorough, using multiple benchmarks and LLMs, and the ablation studies provide valuable insights into the algorithm's components. The analysis of existing reasoning models' performance on theory-of-mind tasks reveals interesting limitations, underscoring the difference between social reasoning and other domains.

However, some weaknesses exist.  While the algorithm is presented as generalizable, its reliance on LLM prompts for hypothesis generation and weighting introduces a dependence on the capabilities and biases of the specific LLM used.  The mapping of qualitative likelihood scores ("very likely" to "very unlikely") to numerical weights might lack precision and could be improved by leveraging LLM log probabilities directly, if available.  The paper also acknowledges some inherent biases in the models' hypothesis generation.  Further investigation into these biases and potential mitigation strategies would strengthen the contribution.  Finally, the direct comparison to reasoning models might be slightly unfair given the potential differences in training data and objectives.

Despite these limitations, the paper's novelty in combining Bayesian ToM, SMC, and LLMs in a novel way for mental state inference in open-ended text, along with its comprehensive evaluation and insightful analysis, makes it a significant contribution.  It opens new avenues for research on inference-time reasoning in social contexts.

### Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882v1)
- **Authors**: Shao Zhang, Xihuai Wang, Wenhao Zhang, Chaoran Li, Junru Song, Tingyu Li, Lin Qiu, Xuezhi Cao, Xunliang Cai, Wen Yao, Weinan Zhang, Xinbing Wang, Ying Wen
- **Abstract**: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework designed for real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration.  Existing LLM-based agents struggle with the latency and adaptability challenges inherent in such interactions. DPT-Agent addresses this by integrating a fast, intuitive System 1 (Finite State Machine and code-as-policy) with a slower, deliberative System 2 (Theory of Mind and asynchronous reflection) based on Dual Process Theory.  Experiments in a challenging Overcooked environment, comparing DPT-Agent against baseline LLM-based agents and human collaborators, demonstrate significant performance improvements in both objective metrics (score, efficiency) and subjective user preference.  The authors claim DPT-Agent is the first framework to autonomously achieve successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration in this complex scenario.  The code and environment are open-sourced.


**Critical Evaluation and Score:**

The paper presents a compelling solution to a significant challenge in human-AI interaction. The integration of Dual Process Theory is a novel approach that directly tackles the trade-off between speed and reasoning capabilities in LLMs.  The use of a Finite State Machine for System 1 cleverly mitigates latency issues, while the Theory of Mind module in System 2 enhances adaptability to human partners.  The experimental design, with both rule-based agents and human participants, provides robust validation of the proposed framework.  The open-sourcing of the code and environment is a significant contribution to the research community, facilitating further development and exploration in this crucial area.

However, some weaknesses exist.  The reliance on code-as-policy might limit generalizability to other tasks, and the effectiveness of the ToM module seems dependent on the underlying LLM's capabilities. The claim of being the *first* such framework requires a thorough review of existing literature to be fully substantiated.  While the experiments are extensive, a larger-scale study with more diverse participants would further strengthen the findings.

Despite these minor weaknesses, the paper's innovative approach, thorough evaluation, and open-source contribution represent a substantial advancement in the field of human-AI collaboration.  The potential impact on future research and real-world applications is considerable.

### Continual Quantization-Aware Pre-Training: When to transition from 16-bit to 1.58-bit pre-training for BitNet language models?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11895v1)
- **Authors**: Jacob Nielsen, Peter Schneider-Kamp, Lukas Galke
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) require immense resources for training and inference. Quantization, a technique that reduces the precision of model parameters, offers a promising solution for improving LLM efficiency and sustainability. While post-training quantization methods typically achieve 4-8 bits per parameter, recent research suggests that training LLMs with 1.58 bits per weight parameter from scratch can maintain model accuracy while greatly reducing memory requirements and energy consumption at inference time. Here, we investigate a training strategy for quantization-aware pre-training, where the models are first trained with 16-bit precision and then transition into 1.58-bit quantization-aware training. Our results on 11 downstream tasks show that this 16-to-1.58-bit training strategy is preferable over full 1.58-bit training and leaves models closer to those which have undergone 16-bit training. We further investigate the effects of retaining the optimizer state at the transition point and gradually phasing in quantization strength -- finding that both techniques alleviate the magnitude of loss spikes, but also that these effects can be compensated through further training.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates a hybrid training strategy for quantizing large language models (LLMs) to 1.58 bits per parameter.  Instead of training directly at low precision (1.58 bits), the authors propose a "continual quantization-aware pre-training" approach: first training the model with standard 16-bit precision for a certain number of steps, then transitioning to 1.58-bit quantization-aware training.  Through experiments on 11 downstream tasks using the OLMo 1B parameter model and the Dolma dataset, they demonstrate that this hybrid approach often outperforms training directly with 1.58 bits.  They also analyze the impact of retaining optimizer state during the transition and gradually phasing in quantization strength, finding these factors to have limited long-term effects on performance.  The paper concludes that a hybrid strategy offers a more efficient pathway to high-performing, low-precision LLMs.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the growing field of efficient LLM training. The core finding â€“ that a hybrid 16-bit/1.58-bit training strategy outperforms purely 1.58-bit training â€“ is interesting and potentially impactful. The systematic exploration of different transition points, optimizer state retention, and gradual quantization is a strength.  The use of multiple downstream tasks for evaluation adds robustness to the findings.

However, several weaknesses limit the paper's overall impact:

* **Limited Novelty:** While the hybrid approach is presented as novel, the core idea of leveraging higher-precision training to improve the initialization for low-precision training is not entirely new.  The paper acknowledges related work but doesn't fully differentiate its approach sufficiently.  The incremental improvements over existing methods aren't clearly quantified.
* **Focus on a Single Architecture:**  The experiments are confined to a single model architecture (OLMo 1B).  Generalizability to other architectures is unclear.  The results might not be representative of the broader LLM landscape.
* **Missing Statistical Significance Analysis:**  The paper mentions that the differences in downstream performance between methods are small and that the statistical significance isn't clear. This is a major weakness; a thorough statistical analysis is crucial to validate the claims.
* **Limited Discussion on Computational Cost:** While the paper emphasizes efficiency, a detailed comparison of the computational cost of the hybrid approach versus purely 1.58-bit training is missing.  The potential benefits need to be clearly weighed against the added computational burden of the initial 16-bit phase.


Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper presents a valuable but not groundbreaking contribution. The findings are intriguing, but the lack of broader generalizability and robust statistical analysis prevents it from being a truly exceptional contribution.  The insights could be useful for practitioners, but more rigorous work is needed to solidify the conclusions.

### CAMEL: Continuous Action Masking Enabled by Large Language Models for Reinforcement Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11896v1)
- **Authors**: Yanxiao Zhao, Yangge Qian, Jingyang Shan, Xiaolin Qin
- **Abstract**: Reinforcement learning (RL) in continuous action spaces encounters persistent challenges, such as inefficient exploration and convergence to suboptimal solutions. To address these limitations, we propose CAMEL, a novel framework integrating LLM-generated suboptimal policies into the RL training pipeline. CAMEL leverages dynamic action masking and an adaptive epsilon-masking mechanism to guide exploration during early training stages while gradually enabling agents to optimize policies independently. At the core of CAMEL lies the integration of Python-executable suboptimal policies generated by LLMs based on environment descriptions and task objectives. Although simplistic and hard-coded, these policies offer valuable initial guidance for RL agents. To effectively utilize these priors, CAMEL employs masking-aware optimization to dynamically constrain the action space based on LLM outputs. Additionally, epsilon-masking gradually reduces reliance on LLM-generated guidance, enabling agents to transition from constrained exploration to autonomous policy refinement. Experimental validation on Gymnasium MuJoCo environments demonstrates the effectiveness of CAMEL. In Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, LLM-generated policies significantly improve sample efficiency, achieving performance comparable to or surpassing expert masking baselines. For Walker2d-v4, where LLMs struggle to accurately model bipedal gait dynamics, CAMEL maintains robust RL performance without notable degradation, highlighting the framework's adaptability across diverse tasks. While CAMEL shows promise in enhancing sample efficiency and mitigating convergence challenges, these issues remain open for further research. Future work aims to generalize CAMEL to multimodal LLMs for broader observation-action spaces and automate policy evaluation, reducing human intervention and enhancing scalability in RL training pipelines.
- **Summary**: CAMEL (Continuous Action Masking Enabled by Large Language Models) is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to improve sample efficiency and mitigate convergence issues in continuous action spaces.  It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate suboptimal, yet functional, initial policies in the form of Python code. These policies are then used to dynamically mask the action space, guiding the RL agent's exploration during early training. An epsilon-masking mechanism gradually reduces the reliance on the LLM's guidance, allowing the agent to transition to independent policy refinement. Experiments on MuJoCo environments (Hopper-v4, Walker2d-v4, Ant-v4) demonstrated improved sample efficiency in Hopper-v4 and Ant-v4, while maintaining robust performance in Walker2d-v4 even when the LLM provided poor initial policies.  Future work aims to extend the framework to multimodal LLMs and automate policy evaluation.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents an interesting and potentially useful approach to integrating LLMs into RL. The idea of using LLM-generated policies for initial guidance and action masking is novel, particularly its application to continuous action spaces. The epsilon-masking mechanism provides a clever way to balance LLM-guided exploration with independent learning.  The experimental results, while positive in some environments, are not overwhelmingly conclusive.  The reliance on human expert evaluation of the LLM-generated policies is a significant limitation, hindering scalability and reproducibility.  The success heavily depends on the quality of the LLM-generated policies, which is not consistently guaranteed across different environments as demonstrated by the Walker2d-v4 results. The paper acknowledges these limitations and proposes promising avenues for future work.  While the novelty is present, the impact remains to be fully seen, pending further development and broader application.


**Score: 7**

**Rationale:**

The score reflects the paper's strengths and weaknesses.  The central ideaâ€”leveraging LLMs to improve RL exploration in continuous spaces through action maskingâ€”is innovative and contributes to the growing field of LLM-enhanced RL.  The experimental results show promise, particularly in environments where the LLM-generated policies were effective. However, the dependence on human intervention for policy selection, the inconsistent performance across different environments, and the lack of extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art RL methods temper the overall impact.  The proposed future directions, if successfully addressed, could significantly enhance the framework's value and potentially elevate its impact to a higher score.  The current state, however, merits a 7, reflecting a solid contribution with room for improvement and broader validation.

- **Abstract**: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in open-ended conversation, generating more accurate and personalized responses. However, their abilities to memorize, recall, and reason in sustained interactions within real-world scenarios remain underexplored. This paper introduces MMRC, a Multi-Modal Real-world Conversation benchmark for evaluating six core open-ended abilities of MLLMs: information extraction, multi-turn reasoning, information update, image management, memory recall, and answer refusal. With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions. We identify four common failure patterns: long-term memory degradation, inadequacies in updating factual knowledge, accumulated assumption of error propagation, and reluctance to say no. To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple yet effective NOTE-TAKING strategy, which can record key information from the conversation and remind the model during its responses, enhancing conversational capabilities. Experiments across six MLLMs demonstrate significant performance improvements.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces MMRC, a new large-scale benchmark (5,120 conversations, 28,720 questions) for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in open-ended conversations.  MMRC assesses six core abilities: information extraction, multi-turn reasoning, information update, image management, memory recall, and answer refusal.  Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a significant accuracy drop during extended interactions, highlighting four common failure modes: long-term memory degradation, inadequate knowledge updating, error propagation, and reluctance to refuse answers.  To address these limitations, the authors propose a NOTE-TAKING strategy that records key information and provides it as structured prompts, significantly improving performance across six MLLMs.

**Rigorous Rationale and Novelty Score:**

Score: 7

**Strengths:**

* **Significant Benchmark:** MMRC represents a substantial advancement over existing benchmarks by focusing on open-ended, multi-turn, multimodal conversations reflecting real-world complexity. Its scale and comprehensive evaluation framework are noteworthy contributions.
* **Identification of Key Failure Modes:** The paper meticulously identifies four crucial failure patterns in current MLLMs, providing valuable insights into their limitations and guiding future research directions.  This analysis is a strong contribution.
* **Proposed Mitigation Strategy:** The NOTE-TAKING strategy, while relatively simple, demonstrably improves MLLM performance, suggesting a practical approach to enhance long-term memory and reasoning capabilities.
* **Comprehensive Evaluation:**  The use of GPT-based evaluation, human evaluation, and objective precision metrics provides a robust and multifaceted assessment of MLLM capabilities.

**Weaknesses:**

* **NOTE-TAKING Limitations:**  The NOTE-TAKING strategy, while effective, adds computational overhead and may not fully address the underlying issues of MLLM architecture and training. It's a helpful heuristic, but not a fundamental solution.
* **Dataset Bias:** The paper acknowledges potential biases in the dataset, which could influence the evaluation results and limit the generalizability of the findings.  Further investigation into dataset bias and mitigation strategies is warranted.
* **Limited Generalizability of Findings:** While the benchmark is larger than previous ones, the specific models and user demographics involved may still limit the generalizability of the findings to other MLLMs and user populations.


The paper makes a strong contribution to the field by providing a much-needed realistic benchmark and insightful analysis of MLLM limitations.  However, the proposed solution is a pragmatic improvement rather than a transformative breakthrough, hence the score of 7.  Future work addressing the identified limitations, particularly dataset bias and the underlying architectural challenges, would further strengthen the impact of this research.

### Approximating a spatially-heterogeneously mass-emitting object by multiple point sources in a diffusion model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11908v1)
- **Authors**: Qiyao Peng, Sander C. Hille
- **Abstract**: Various biological cells secrete diffusing chemical compounds into their environment for communication purposes. Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work. Moreover, an explicit Green's function approach is introduced that has significant benefits in circumventing numerical instability that may occur when the Dirac sources have high intensities.
- **Summary**: This paper proposes a novel multi-Dirac point source approach to model the spatially heterogeneous secretion of diffusing compounds from biological cells, improving upon previous single-point source models.  The authors address the limitations of existing models by representing the inhomogeneous flux across a cell membrane with multiple point sources (and sinks) strategically positioned within the cell's virtual space. They derive explicit expressions for the intensities of these point sources based on a Fourier decomposition of the flux and demonstrate that this multi-Dirac approach accurately approximates the concentration profiles predicted by a more computationally expensive spatial exclusion model.  To mitigate numerical instability associated with high-intensity point sources, they introduce an explicit Green's function approach, decoupling the singular part of the solution from the numerical solver.  The effectiveness of the method is validated through numerical simulations and Monte Carlo analysis, exploring the influence of various parameters (diffusion coefficient, flux heterogeneity, etc.).

**Critical Evaluation:**

**Strengths:**

* **Novelty:** The core contributionâ€”the multi-Dirac point source approach with derived intensity expressionsâ€”is novel in the context of modeling spatially heterogeneous secretion in diffusion models. The explicit Green's function method to handle numerical instability is a valuable addition, enhancing the practical applicability of the method.
* **Mathematical Rigor:** The paper presents a relatively sound mathematical framework, including a discussion of weak solutions and the derivation of intensity expressions. The use of Fourier analysis to handle inhomogeneous fluxes is appropriate.
* **Thorough Numerical Analysis:** The numerical experiments are comprehensive, encompassing various parameters and comparing different solution methods.  Monte Carlo simulations provide a valuable statistical assessment of the model's performance across a wider range of conditions.

**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited Generalizability:** The inhomogeneous flux is modeled as a simple sinusoidal function.  Extending the approach to more complex, realistic flux distributions remains a challenge and is acknowledged as future work, which limits the immediate impact of the current findings.
* **Ad Hoc Intensity Determination:** While the intensity calculation method yields accurate results, the justification for its specific form is somewhat heuristic.  A more rigorous theoretical basis is needed.
* **Computational Cost:** While aiming for computational efficiency, the paper doesn't provide a detailed comparison of the computational cost between the proposed method and the spatial exclusion model for large-scale simulations with many cells. The benefit of the proposed method is implied, rather than concretely demonstrated.
* **Focus on Single Cell:** The simulations predominantly focus on a single cell. Extending the model to multiple interacting cells poses a significant challenge and is only briefly mentioned.


**Significance:** The paper contributes to a growing field of modeling biological processes using partial differential equations.  The proposed method could offer advantages in simulating large-scale cell populations or systems with moving cells, where the computational cost of traditional methods becomes prohibitive.  However, its current limitations restrict its broader impact.  The paper provides a valuable starting point, particularly with the innovative combination of multi-point sources and the singularity removal technique.

Score: 7

**Rationale:** The paper exhibits significant novelty in its proposed method and presents a thorough investigation of its properties. However, the limitations regarding generalizability and the somewhat heuristic justification for the intensity calculations prevent a higher score. The paper's impact will depend on future work extending the methodology to more realistic scenarios and thoroughly demonstrating the claimed computational advantages over existing methods.  A more rigorous theoretical framework would greatly strengthen the paper's contribution.

### Adversarial Alignment for LLMs Requires Simpler, Reproducible, and More Measurable Objectives
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11910v1)
- **Authors**: Leo Schwinn, Yan Scholten, Tom WollschlÃ¤ger, Sophie Xhonneux, Stephen Casper, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann, Gauthier Gidel
- **Abstract**: Misaligned research objectives have considerably hindered progress in adversarial robustness research over the past decade. For instance, an extensive focus on optimizing target metrics, while neglecting rigorous standardized evaluation, has led researchers to pursue ad-hoc heuristic defenses that were seemingly effective. Yet, most of these were exposed as flawed by subsequent evaluations, ultimately contributing little measurable progress to the field. In this position paper, we illustrate that current research on the robustness of large language models (LLMs) risks repeating past patterns with potentially worsened real-world implications. To address this, we argue that realigned objectives are necessary for meaningful progress in adversarial alignment. To this end, we build on established cybersecurity taxonomy to formally define differences between past and emerging threat models that apply to LLMs. Using this framework, we illustrate that progress requires disentangling adversarial alignment into addressable sub-problems and returning to core academic principles, such as measureability, reproducibility, and comparability. Although the field presents significant challenges, the fresh start on adversarial robustness offers the unique opportunity to build on past experience while avoiding previous mistakes.
- **Summary**: This position paper argues that research on adversarial robustness in Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by overly complex and poorly defined objectives, echoing past mistakes in adversarial robustness research for other domains.  The authors contend that a focus on improving benchmark numbers without sufficient attention to rigorous, reproducible, and measurable evaluations has led to ineffective, ad-hoc defenses.  They propose a realignment of research objectives, advocating for simpler, more clearly defined sub-problems with measurable goals.  This involves simplifying datasets, using measurable proxy objectives in attack evaluations, and prioritizing reproducible research using open-source models and community-driven leaderboards and standardized benchmarks.  The paper uses a taxonomy inspired by cybersecurity frameworks to structure its arguments, comparing past and current threat models for LLMs.  It also addresses potential counterarguments, such as the "reality gap" between simplified research settings and real-world complexities.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution by highlighting crucial methodological issues hindering progress in LLM adversarial robustness. Its strength lies in its clear articulation of the problem, drawing parallels to past failures in adversarial machine learning and proposing concrete solutions. The taxonomy framework is helpful for organizing the discussion and comparing different threat models. The call for simpler, more measurable objectives and reproducible research is well-justified and resonates with the broader concerns of reproducibility in AI research.  The acknowledgement of counterarguments, such as the potential "reality gap," demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the challenges.

However, the paper's novelty is limited. While it effectively synthesizes existing concerns and proposes a constructive path forward, it doesn't introduce groundbreaking new techniques or theoretical insights.  The suggested solutions are largely common-sense recommendations for better research practices, rather than novel methodologies.  The paper's impact hinges on its ability to influence the research community to adopt these better practices.

While the paperâ€™s analysis is thorough,  its call for simplifying problems risks neglecting the systemic nature of real-world LLM deployment, a point the authors themselves acknowledge.  Overemphasizing isolated sub-problems might hinder the development of robust defenses against complex, real-world attacks that exploit multiple vulnerabilities.

The paper's influence will depend on its uptake by the research community.  If it succeeds in shifting the focus towards more rigorous and reproducible research, it will have a significant positive impact.  However,  the success of this shift remains to be seen.


Score: 7

Rationale: The paper provides a valuable and timely overview of the challenges in LLM adversarial robustness research. Its strength is in its synthesis of existing concerns and its clear and well-reasoned call for improved research practices. However, the lack of novel technical contributions and the potential risks associated with oversimplifying the problem limit its overall novelty and potential impact.  A score of 7 reflects its significant contribution in identifying critical methodological issues and offering constructive suggestions, while acknowledging its limitations in terms of novel contributions.

### EssayJudge: A Multi-Granular Benchmark for Assessing Automated Essay Scoring Capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11916v1)
- **Authors**: Jiamin Su, Yibo Yan, Fangteng Fu, Han Zhang, Jingheng Ye, Xiang Liu, Jiahao Huo, Huiyu Zhou, Xuming Hu
- **Abstract**: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) plays a crucial role in educational assessment by providing scalable and consistent evaluations of writing tasks. However, traditional AES systems face three major challenges: (1) reliance on handcrafted features that limit generalizability, (2) difficulty in capturing fine-grained traits like coherence and argumentation, and (3) inability to handle multimodal contexts. In the era of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we propose EssayJudge, the first multimodal benchmark to evaluate AES capabilities across lexical-, sentence-, and discourse-level traits. By leveraging MLLMs' strengths in trait-specific scoring and multimodal context understanding, EssayJudge aims to offer precise, context-rich evaluations without manual feature engineering, addressing longstanding AES limitations. Our experiments with 18 representative MLLMs reveal gaps in AES performance compared to human evaluation, particularly in discourse-level traits, highlighting the need for further advancements in MLLM-based AES research. Our dataset and code will be available upon acceptance.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces EssayJudge, the first multimodal benchmark for evaluating Automated Essay Scoring (AES) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  Existing AES systems struggle with generalizability (due to handcrafted features), capturing fine-grained traits (coherence, argumentation), and handling multimodal contexts. EssayJudge addresses these limitations by leveraging MLLMs' ability to learn directly from text and images, assessing essays across lexical, sentence, and discourse levels using ten specific traits.  Experiments on 18 MLLMs (both open-source and closed-source) reveal that closed-source models, particularly GPT-4, significantly outperform open-source models, though a gap remains compared to human evaluation, especially at the discourse level.  The paper contributes a new multimodal AES dataset and a multi-granular scoring framework.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of automated essay scoring, but its novelty and significance aren't without caveats.

**Strengths:**

* **Addressing a crucial limitation:** The focus on multimodal AES is a significant advancement, acknowledging the real-world complexity of essays that often include visual elements.
* **Comprehensive benchmark:** The EssayJudge benchmark is well-designed, incorporating a multi-granular scoring framework with ten traits, offering a more nuanced evaluation than previous benchmarks.
* **Extensive experimentation:** The evaluation of 18 MLLMs provides a robust comparison of different models and their strengths and weaknesses.
* **Data availability (promised):** The promise of releasing the dataset and code is crucial for reproducibility and further research in the community.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited novelty in core methodology:** While the multimodal aspect is novel in the context of AES, the underlying techniques used by the MLLMs themselves aren't groundbreaking. The paper mostly applies existing MLLMs to a new task and dataset.
* **Focus on existing models:** The study evaluates existing MLLMs rather than proposing new architectures specifically designed for AES.  This limits the potential impact on the development of improved AES models.
* **Dataset limitations (acknowledged):** The paper acknowledges limitations in the dataset, primarily the use of non-native English speakers' essays and limited topic diversity. This raises concerns about the generalizability of findings.
* **Overemphasis on GPT-4's performance:** While GPT-4's superior performance is notable, the paper perhaps overemphasizes it, potentially overshadowing the contributions of other models and the broader implications of the findings.


**Potential Influence:**

EssayJudge could significantly influence the field by providing a standardized benchmark for evaluating MLLM-based AES systems.  This could lead to improved model development and more accurate and fair essay scoring. However, the impact will depend on the dataset's eventual release and the community's adoption of the benchmark.


**Score: 7**

The paper makes a solid contribution by addressing a significant gap in AES research: the lack of multimodal benchmarks. The comprehensive evaluation and the introduction of EssayJudge are valuable.  However, the core methodology isn't radically novel, and the dataset limitations could hinder its broad applicability.  A higher score would require more substantial methodological innovation or a more rigorously validated dataset.

### From Text to Trust: Empowering AI-assisted Decision Making with Adaptive LLM-powered Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11919v1)
- **Authors**: Zhuoyan Li, Hangxiao Zhu, Zhuoran Lu, Ziang Xiao, Ming Yin
- **Abstract**: AI-assisted decision making becomes increasingly prevalent, yet individuals often fail to utilize AI-based decision aids appropriately especially when the AI explanations are absent, potentially as they do not %understand reflect on AI's decision recommendations critically. Large language models (LLMs), with their exceptional conversational and analytical capabilities, present great opportunities to enhance AI-assisted decision making in the absence of AI explanations by providing natural-language-based analysis of AI's decision recommendation, e.g., how each feature of a decision making task might contribute to the AI recommendation. In this paper, via a randomized experiment, we first show that presenting LLM-powered analysis of each task feature, either sequentially or concurrently, does not significantly improve people's AI-assisted decision performance. To enable decision makers to better leverage LLM-powered analysis, we then propose an algorithmic framework to characterize the effects of LLM-powered analysis on human decisions and dynamically decide which analysis to present. Our evaluation with human subjects shows that this approach effectively improves decision makers' appropriate reliance on AI in AI-assisted decision making.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance AI-assisted decision-making, particularly when AI explanations are unavailable.  The authors first demonstrate through a randomized controlled experiment that simply presenting LLM-generated analyses of AI recommendations (sequentially or concurrently) doesn't significantly improve human decision accuracy or appropriate reliance on the AI.  Building on this negative finding, they propose an algorithmic framework that *adaptively* selects and presents LLM analyses based on a learned model of human behavior and the predicted utility of each analysis. A second experiment shows that this adaptive approach significantly improves decision accuracy and reduces overreliance on the AI compared to baseline methods.  The key innovation is the algorithmic selection of LLM-generated explanations, dynamically tailoring the information presented to the individual user's interaction history.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the burgeoning field of Human-AI interaction, particularly concerning explainable AI (XAI) and the role of LLMs. The core strength lies in its empirical approach.  The authors conduct rigorous experiments with human subjects, demonstrating a clear limitation of naive LLM integration and then validating their proposed adaptive framework.  The algorithmic framework itself is novel, combining human behavioral modeling with utility-maximizing selection of explanations.  The results clearly demonstrate the benefits of this adaptive approach, providing quantitative evidence of improved accuracy and reduced overreliance.  The exploratory analyses further illuminate *why* the adaptive approach works, showing a smart selection of supporting/contradictory evidence depending on the AI's reliability.


However, several weaknesses limit the overall impact.  The reliance on GPT-4 raises concerns about generalizability to other LLMs. The specific tasks (income and recidivism prediction) also limit the breadth of applicability, though the authors acknowledge and partially address this.  The human behavioral model, while sophisticated, still operates on a population level and doesn't fully account for individual differences.  The discussion of potential misuse of the algorithmic framework is important but could be more thoroughly developed, offering concrete mitigations beyond general security recommendations.


Despite these weaknesses, the paper's well-designed experiments, novel algorithmic framework, and clear demonstration of improved human-AI collaboration warrant a high score.  The findings are significant because they move beyond simply presenting LLM-generated explanations to a more nuanced and effective interaction design. This work could influence future research on adaptive XAI, personalized AI assistance, and the ethical considerations of using LLMs to influence human decisions.

### GRAPHGPT-O: Synergistic Multimodal Comprehension and Generation on Graphs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11925v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Fang, Bowen Jin, Jiacheng Shen, Sirui Ding, Qiaoyu Tan, Jiawei Han
- **Abstract**: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled the integration of multiple modalities, including texts and images, within the large language model (LLM) framework. However, texts and images are usually interconnected, forming a multimodal attributed graph (MMAG). It is underexplored how MLLMs can incorporate the relational information (\textit{i.e.}, graph structure) and semantic information (\textit{i.e.,} texts and images) on such graphs for multimodal comprehension and generation. In this paper, we propose GraphGPT-o, which supports omni-multimodal understanding and creation on MMAGs. We first comprehensively study linearization variants to transform semantic and structural information as input for MLLMs. Then, we propose a hierarchical aligner that enables deep graph encoding, bridging the gap between MMAGs and MLLMs. Finally, we explore the inference choices, adapting MLLM to interleaved text and image generation in graph scenarios. Extensive experiments on three datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Datasets and codes will be open-sourced upon acceptance.
- **Summary**: GRAPHGPT-O is a novel multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for understanding and generating multimodal content (text and images) from Multimodal Attributed Graphs (MMAGs).  The paper addresses the challenges of applying LLMs to MMAGs, namely the exponential growth of subgraph size, the non-Euclidean nature of graphs, hierarchical modality dependencies (between text and image within a node, and across nodes in the subgraph), and inference dependencies between text and image generation.

GRAPHGPT-O tackles these challenges through several key contributions:  a personalized PageRank-based graph sampling method to limit input size; exploration of graph linearization and a hierarchical aligner (using Q-Formers) to capture node-level and subgraph-level modality dependencies; and investigation of sequential and parallel inference strategies.  Experiments on three real-world datasets (ART500K, Amazon-Baby, Amazon-Beauty) demonstrate improvements over baseline models in image and text generation quality, and alignment with the graph context.  The authors also conduct ablation studies to assess the contribution of individual components.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the emerging field of LLMs applied to graph data, particularly in the multimodal context.  The problem formulation is well-defined and addresses a clear gap in the existing literature, namely the lack of effective MLLMs operating on MMAGs.  The proposed hierarchical aligner, incorporating both node-level and subgraph-level information processing, is a particularly strong contribution, offering a more nuanced approach than simple linearization methods. The use of personalized PageRank for subgraph sampling is also a practical and effective solution to the context explosion problem.  The thorough experimental evaluation, including ablation studies and comparison to strong baselines, enhances the credibility of the findings.  The open-sourcing of datasets and code is a significant positive.

However, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach.  While some limitations are mentioned (homogeneous graphs), a more comprehensive analysis of potential weaknesses and future research directions would strengthen the paper's impact. For example,  a deeper analysis of the computational cost of the hierarchical aligner would be beneficial.  The novelty, while significant, is not groundbreaking; it builds upon existing work in LLMs, graph neural networks, and multimodal models.

Score: 8

**Rationale:** The paper tackles a significant and timely problem, proposes a well-designed and effective solution, and provides strong empirical evidence to support its claims.  The relatively high score reflects the novelty and significance of the work within the field, though a more comprehensive discussion of limitations and a slightly more innovative architectural approach could have elevated the score further.

### On Representational Dissociation of Language and Arithmetic in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11932v1)
- **Authors**: Riku Kisako, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Ryohei Sasano
- **Abstract**: The association between language and (non-linguistic) thinking ability in humans has long been debated, and recently, neuroscientific evidence of brain activity patterns has been considered. Such a scientific context naturally raises an interdisciplinary question -- what about such a language-thought dissociation in large language models (LLMs)? In this paper, as an initial foray, we explore this question by focusing on simple arithmetic skills (e.g., $1+2=$ ?) as a thinking ability and analyzing the geometry of their encoding in LLMs' representation space. Our experiments with linear classifiers and cluster separability tests demonstrate that simple arithmetic equations and general language input are encoded in completely separated regions in LLMs' internal representation space across all the layers, which is also supported with more controlled stimuli (e.g., spelled-out equations). These tentatively suggest that arithmetic reasoning is mapped into a distinct region from general language input, which is in line with the neuroscientific observations of human brain activations, while we also point out their somewhat cognitively implausible geometric properties.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the representational dissociation of language and arithmetic abilities within large language models (LLMs).  Using linear classifiers and cluster separability tests on several LLMs, the authors demonstrate a clear separation between the internal representations of simple arithmetic equations and general language inputs across all layers of the models. This separation holds even when using spelled-out equations, controlling for character type differences.  However, the study reveals a surprising finding:  more complex tasks requiring both language and arithmetic (like math word problems) form a distinct cluster separate from both language and the arithmetic region identified with simple equations.  The linear classifier consistently assigns these complex problems to the language region. This suggests LLMs may not treat complex problems as a composite of language and arithmetic but instead utilize separate arithmetic regions for different task formats, exhibiting a finer-grained modularity than initially expected.  The work draws a parallel between this LLM finding and neuroscientific observations of dissociated brain activity during language and non-linguistic reasoning.  The authors acknowledge limitations, including the reliance on geometric analysis and the need for causal analysis to strengthen their conclusions.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents an interesting investigation into the internal representations of LLMs, attempting to bridge the gap between computational linguistics and neuroscience.  The experimental design is relatively robust, using multiple LLMs and different types of stimuli to control for confounding factors. The finding of representational dissociation between simple arithmetic and language is not entirely unexpected, but the unexpected clustering of complex, combined tasks adds a layer of intrigue and necessitates further investigation. The use of established methods like linear classifiers and GDV for assessing cluster separability provides a quantitative basis for the claims.

However, the paperâ€™s significance is somewhat limited by its reliance on correlational analysis. The observation of separate clusters doesn't definitively prove a functional dissociation; it simply indicates distinct representational spaces.  The authors correctly acknowledge this limitation and call for causal analyses to establish a stronger link between the observed representational separation and actual computational mechanisms.  Furthermore, the "excessive" dissociation observed with complex tasks might be a consequence of the specific training data or architectural limitations of LLMs, rather than a fundamental cognitive principle. The paper doesn't fully explore alternative interpretations of these results.

While the paper's novelty lies in its application of representational analysis to explore the language-thought dissociation hypothesis within LLMs, the contribution is incremental rather than revolutionary.  The field is already actively exploring the internal mechanisms of LLMs, and this paper contributes one specific piece to this larger puzzle.  The findings warrant further research but don't necessarily redefine our understanding of LLMs in a groundbreaking way.


Score: 6

The score reflects the paper's strengths (rigorous methodology, interesting findings, and attempt to bridge disciplines) balanced against its weaknesses (correlational nature, lack of causal analysis, and incremental contribution to the field).  While the study raises important questions and generates intriguing results, it falls short of being a truly exceptional contribution due to its reliance on correlation and the limitations of its interpretation.  Further research based on causal inference and more nuanced analyses will be needed to solidify the conclusions and extend the significance of this work.

### Navigating the Helpfulness-Truthfulness Trade-Off with Uncertainty-Aware Instruction Fine-Tuning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11962v1)
- **Authors**: Tianyi Wu, Jingwei Ni, Bryan Hooi, Jiaheng Zhang, Elliott Ash, See-Kiong Ng, Mrinmaya Sachan, Markus Leippold
- **Abstract**: Instruction Fine-tuning (IFT) can enhance the helpfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs), but it may lower their truthfulness. This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses with long-tail knowledge that is not well covered during pre-training, leading to more informative but less truthful answers when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate this helpfulness-truthfulness trade-off in IFT and propose $\textbf{UNIT}$, a novel IFT paradigm to address it. UNIT teaches LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly reflect it at the end of their responses. Experimental results show that UNIT-tuned models maintain their helpfulness while distinguishing between certain and uncertain claims, thereby reducing hallucinations.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the trade-off between helpfulness and truthfulness in instruction fine-tuning (IFT) of Large Language Models (LLMs).  The authors empirically demonstrate that increasing helpfulness via IFT, particularly by incorporating less familiar knowledge, often leads to increased hallucinations (inaccuracies).  To address this, they propose UNIT, a novel IFT paradigm that trains LLMs to explicitly express uncertainty about their claims at the end of their responses.  UNIT achieves this by appending a "reflection" section detailing uncertain knowledge.  Experiments show that UNIT-tuned models maintain helpfulness while significantly improving honesty (reducing misleading outputs) by highlighting potential inaccuracies.  However,  the improvement in honesty is not perfect and is limited in several ways.

**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper makes a valuable contribution by empirically confirming the intuitive notion that pushing LLMs towards higher helpfulness via IFT can negatively affect their truthfulness. This observation is important because much of the current research focuses solely on improving helpfulness without adequately considering the potential for increased hallucinations.  The proposed UNIT method is an interesting attempt to mitigate this problem by explicitly incorporating uncertainty modeling. The use of Claim Conditioned Probability (CCP) for uncertainty quantification is a clever approach.

However, the novelty is somewhat limited.  The core idea of prompting LLMs to express uncertainty is not entirely new; several other works have explored similar concepts. While UNIT's specific implementation using CCP and the "reflection" section is novel, the overall contribution doesn't represent a paradigm shift. The results demonstrating improved honesty are encouraging, but the relatively modest improvements in Honesty Balanced Accuracy (slightly above random) and the reliance on GPT-4 for several crucial steps (claim extraction, fact-checking, etc.) limit the overall impact. The dependence on GPT-4 also raises concerns about reproducibility and the generalizability of the findings. The paper acknowledges these limitations, but they significantly impact the overall significance.

The paper's strengths lie in its clear articulation of the problem, its rigorous experimental setup, and its careful analysis of results.  Its weakness is the limited novelty and the imperfections of the proposed solution. The potential influence on the field is moderate â€“ it adds to the growing body of work addressing LLMs' reliability, but it is unlikely to fundamentally change the approach to LLM alignment.

### Generating Text from Uniform Meaning Representation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11973v1)
- **Authors**: Emma Markle, Reihaneh Iranmanesh, Shira Wein
- **Abstract**: Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) is a recently developed graph-based semantic representation, which expands on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) in a number of ways, in particular through the inclusion of document-level information and multilingual flexibility. In order to effectively adopt and leverage UMR for downstream tasks, efforts must be placed toward developing a UMR technological ecosystem. Though still limited amounts of UMR annotations have been produced to date, in this work, we investigate the first approaches to producing text from multilingual UMR graphs: (1) a pipeline conversion of UMR to AMR, then using AMR-to-text generation models, (2) fine-tuning large language models with UMR data, and (3) fine-tuning existing AMR-to-text generation models with UMR data. Our best performing model achieves a multilingual BERTscore of 0.825 for English and 0.882 for Chinese when compared to the reference, which is a promising indication of the effectiveness of fine-tuning approaches for UMR-to-text generation with even limited amounts of UMR data.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates the generation of text from Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR) graphs, a multilingual, document-level semantic representation extending Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).  Due to the limited availability of UMR annotations, the authors explore three approaches: (1) a pipeline converting UMR to AMR then using existing AMR-to-text models; (2) fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with UMR data; and (3) fine-tuning existing AMR-to-text models with UMR data.  Their best results, using fine-tuned AMR-to-text models, achieve promising multilingual BERTscores (0.825 for English, 0.882 for Chinese).  However, the study highlights challenges in generating meaningful text for low-resource indigenous languages included in the dataset.  The evaluation includes automatic metrics (BERTscore, BLEU, METEOR) and human evaluation of fluency and adequacy.


**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This paper makes a valuable contribution to the nascent field of UMR research but suffers from limitations that constrain its overall impact.

**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a crucial gap:**  The paper tackles a significant challengeâ€”generating text from UMRâ€”a necessary step for wider adoption of this promising semantic representation.
* **Comprehensive methodology:**  The authors explore multiple approaches (pipeline, LLM fine-tuning, AMR-to-text model fine-tuning), providing a thorough comparison of their effectiveness.
* **Multilingual perspective:** The work addresses the multilingual nature of UMR, a key differentiator from AMR, although the low-resource languages present a major hurdle.
* **Combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation:** Using both automatic metrics and human evaluation strengthens the reliability and interpretability of the results.  The acknowledgement of limitations in automatic evaluation for low-resource languages is commendable.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Small dataset:** The limited size of the UMRv1.0 dataset significantly restricts the generalizability of the findings and the potential for robust model training, particularly for low-resource languages. This is a major limitation that affects the overall significance of the results.
* **Limited novelty in individual approaches:** While the application to UMR is novel, the individual approaches (pipeline, fine-tuning) are not inherently groundbreaking. The paper's novelty lies primarily in the combination of these techniques in the context of UMR.
* **Overreliance on existing AMR tools:** The heavy reliance on existing AMR tools limits the exploration of unique properties of UMR that distinguish it from AMR.  More innovative techniques tailored specifically to UMR's structure and document-level information would strengthen the contribution.
* **Inconclusive results for low-resource languages:** The failure to generate meaningful text for the low-resource languages significantly undermines the paper's claim to advance multilingual NLP.  The focus should be shifted to this area in future research.


**Overall Significance:**

The paper is a valuable initial step in developing UMR-to-text generation capabilities. However, the limitations related to dataset size and the inconclusive results for low-resource languages significantly reduce its overall impact. While the paper demonstrates the feasibility of generating text from UMR using existing techniques, it doesn't present a major breakthrough.  Further research with larger datasets and methods explicitly leveraging UMR's unique features is needed to solidify its impact on the field.


Score: 6

The score reflects the paper's contribution to addressing a crucial problem in the emerging UMR field, its relatively comprehensive methodology, and the inclusion of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. However, the significant limitations related to dataset size and the underwhelming performance on low-resource languages prevent a higher score. The paper demonstrates promise but needs further development and larger-scale experimentation to reach a higher level of significance.

- **Authors**: Yinan Chen, Jiangning Zhang, Yali Bi, Xiaobin Hu, Teng Hu, Zhucun Xue, Ran Yi, Yong Liu, Ying Tai
- **Abstract**: Image inversion is a fundamental task in generative models, aiming to map images back to their latent representations to enable downstream applications such as editing, restoration, and style transfer. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in image inversion techniques, focusing on two main paradigms: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion and diffusion model inversion. We categorize these techniques based on their optimization methods. For GAN inversion, we systematically classify existing methods into encoder-based approaches, latent optimization approaches, and hybrid approaches, analyzing their theoretical foundations, technical innovations, and practical trade-offs. For diffusion model inversion, we explore training-free strategies, fine-tuning methods, and the design of additional trainable modules, highlighting their unique advantages and limitations. Additionally, we discuss several popular downstream applications and emerging applications beyond image tasks, identifying current challenges and future research directions. By synthesizing the latest developments, this paper aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a valuable reference resource, promoting further advancements in the field of image inversion. We keep track of the latest works at https://github.com/RyanChenYN/ImageInversion
- **Summary**: This paper provides a comprehensive survey of image inversion techniques, focusing on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models.  It categorizes GAN inversion methods into encoder-based, latent optimization, and hybrid approaches, and diffusion model inversion methods into training-free, fine-tuning, and extra trainable module approaches.  The survey details various techniques within each category, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  It also explores popular downstream applications of image inversion, such as image editing, style transfer, and object manipulation, and discusses emerging applications in video, audio, and 3D domains.  Finally, it identifies open challenges and promising future research directions, such as improving computational efficiency and addressing data bias.  A key contribution is the unification of GAN and diffusion model inversion under a single framework, offering a comparative analysis not found in previous, more focused surveys.  The paper includes a helpful taxonomy of existing methods and a summary of relevant datasets.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

This survey makes a valuable contribution by consolidating the rapidly evolving field of image inversion. The comprehensive taxonomy and categorization of existing methods are significant strengths, offering a structured overview that facilitates understanding and comparison. The inclusion of both GAN and diffusion model inversion methodologies within a single framework is a novel aspect that sets it apart from previous surveys focusing solely on GANs or diffusion models.  The discussion of emerging applications beyond image processing, such as video and audio inversion, expands the scope and relevance of the work.

However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited.  While the unified framework is helpful, much of the content is a synthesis of existing work rather than presenting entirely new findings. The critical analysis of different approaches could be strengthened by providing a more quantitative comparison (e.g., benchmarking results on common datasets) to substantiate the qualitative claims of strengths and weaknesses. The discussion of future directions, while insightful, lacks concrete proposals for specific methodologies or algorithms to tackle the identified open problems.

The paper's significance lies primarily in its organization and consolidation of existing knowledge. It serves as a valuable resource for researchers new to the field, providing a structured entry point into the complexities of image inversion.  However, it may not carry the same weight for established researchers already familiar with the individual techniques described.

Score: 7

Rationale: The score reflects the paper's strengths in organization, comprehensive coverage, and the unification of different approaches.  However, the limited novelty in terms of original contributions and the lack of deeper quantitative analysis prevent it from achieving a higher score.  The paper is a valuable resource and will likely have a positive impact on the field by providing a structured overview, but it doesn't present groundbreaking new research.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion model-generated images can appear indistinguishable from authentic photographs, but these images often contain artifacts and implausibilities that reveal their AI-generated provenance. Given the challenge to public trust in media posed by photorealistic AI-generated images, we conducted a large-scale experiment measuring human detection accuracy on 450 diffusion-model generated images and 149 real images. Based on collecting 749,828 observations and 34,675 comments from 50,444 participants, we find that scene complexity of an image, artifact types within an image, display time of an image, and human curation of AI-generated images all play significant roles in how accurately people distinguish real from AI-generated images. Additionally, we propose a taxonomy characterizing artifacts often appearing in images generated by diffusion models. Our empirical observations and taxonomy offer nuanced insights into the capabilities and limitations of diffusion models to generate photorealistic images in 2024.
- **Summary**: This paper investigates human perception of photorealism in images generated by diffusion models.  The authors conducted a large-scale online experiment (749,828 observations from 50,444 participants) comparing human accuracy in distinguishing 450 AI-generated images and 149 real photographs.  They found that scene complexity, artifact types (categorized in a newly proposed taxonomy encompassing anatomical, stylistic, functional, physics, and sociocultural implausibilities), display time, and human curation all significantly affect detection accuracy.  Higher scene complexity and longer viewing times increased accuracy, while human curation made AI-generated images harder to detect. The study provides a taxonomy of common AI-generated image artifacts and a large dataset for future research.

**Rigorous Rationale and Novelty Score:**

This paper makes a significant contribution to the burgeoning field of AI-generated media detection, particularly focusing on the limitations of current automated detection methods and the importance of human perception.  The large-scale dataset and experiment are major strengths, providing valuable empirical data on a topic where anecdotal evidence and smaller studies have previously dominated.  The proposed taxonomy of artifacts is a useful contribution, offering a structured framework for understanding and identifying flaws in AI-generated images.  The inclusion of display time as a variable is also insightful, highlighting the role of attention and time constraints in detection accuracy.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on self-selected participants introduces potential biases, and the lack of demographic data limits the generalizability of the findings.  While the authors acknowledge the impact of human curation, a more in-depth analysis of the curation process itself would strengthen the paper. The methodology section could benefit from clearer descriptions of the prompt engineering and image refinement techniques used, enhancing reproducibility. Finally, the novelty, while significant, is not groundbreaking; the core concept of human detection of AI-generated images has been explored before.  The strength lies in the scale and comprehensiveness of the study, coupled with the proposed taxonomy.


Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper represents a solid and valuable contribution to the field.  It pushes forward our understanding of human perception in the context of AI-generated imagery and provides practical tools (the taxonomy and dataset) for future research.

### Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018v1)
- **Authors**: Fengwei Teng, Zhaoyang Yu, Quan Shi, Jiayi Zhang, Chenglin Wu, Yuyu Luo
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning progress is often achieved by solving a sequence of independent subquestions, each being self-contained and verifiable. These subquestions are essentially atomic questions, relying primarily on their current state rather than accumulated history, similar to the memoryless transitions in a Markov process. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (AoT), where each state transition in the reasoning process consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a new atomic question state. This iterative decomposition-contraction process continues until reaching directly solvable atomic questions, naturally realizing Markov transitions between question states. Furthermore, these atomic questions can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling AoT to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AoT both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, AoT achieves an 80.6% F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by 3.4% and DeepSeek-R1 by 10.6%. The code will be available at https://github.com/qixucen/atom.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces Atom of Thoughts (AOT), a novel framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference (test-time scaling).  Existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulating historical information, wasting computational resources and hindering effective reasoning. AOT addresses this by decomposing complex questions into a sequence of independent sub-questions (atomic questions), mimicking the memoryless transitions of a Markov process.  Each state transition involves decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph (DAG) and then contracting the sub-questions into a new atomic question. This iterative process continues until directly solvable atomic questions are reached.  AOT can be used as a standalone framework or as a plug-in enhancement for existing methods. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate AOT's effectiveness, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, particularly on multi-hop question answering tasks like HotpotQA.  The key advantage is improved computational efficiency by focusing resources on the current atomic question rather than processing accumulated history.

**Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:**

The paper presents a compelling approach to address a significant limitation in existing LLM reasoning methods: the inefficient management of historical information during test-time scaling. The Markov-inspired decomposition and contraction mechanism is novel and intuitively appealing, mirroring how humans often break down complex problems.  The empirical results, showing significant performance improvements across diverse benchmarks and particularly strong results on HotpotQA, are strong evidence of AOT's effectiveness.  The integration capability, allowing AOT to act as a plug-in for existing frameworks, further enhances its practical value.

However, some weaknesses exist. The reliance on LLMs for both decomposition and contraction introduces potential error propagation. The paper acknowledges the lack of a reflection mechanism to correct for poor initial decompositions, a crucial limitation that could impact robustness. The ablation study, while providing some insights, could be strengthened by exploring a wider range of ablation scenarios.  Furthermore, the paper's claim of mirroring human reasoning is somewhat speculative and needs more thorough justification.  The provided examples in the appendix are helpful, but a deeper analysis of the qualitative aspects of AOT's reasoning process would strengthen the paper.


Considering the strengths (novel approach, strong empirical results, practical integration capability) and weaknesses (potential error propagation, lack of reflection mechanism, limited ablation study), the paper represents a significant contribution to the field of LLM reasoning. The proposed method offers a valuable new perspective and tool for enhancing the efficiency and performance of LLM-based reasoning systems.

### Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude: Adaptive Reasoning for Mathematical Problem Solving
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12022v1)
- **Authors**: Xin Xu, Yan Xu, Tianhao Chen, Yuchen Yan, Chengwu Liu, Zaoyu Chen, Yufei Wang, Yichun Yin, Yasheng Wang, Lifeng Shang, Qun Liu
- **Abstract**: Existing approaches to mathematical reasoning with large language models (LLMs) rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for generalizability or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) for precise computation. While efforts have been made to combine these methods, they primarily rely on post-selection or predefined strategies, leaving an open question: whether LLMs can autonomously adapt their reasoning strategy based on their inherent capabilities. In this work, we propose TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), an adaptive framework that enables LLMs to personalize their reasoning strategy spontaneously, aligning it with their intrinsic aptitude. TATA incorporates base-LLM-aware data selection during supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to tailor training data to the model's unique abilities. This approach equips LLMs to autonomously determine and apply the appropriate reasoning strategy at test time. We evaluate TATA through extensive experiments on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks, using both general-purpose and math-specialized LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that TATA effectively combines the complementary strengths of CoT and TIR, achieving superior or comparable performance with improved inference efficiency compared to TIR alone. Further analysis underscores the critical role of aptitude-aware data selection in enabling LLMs to make effective and adaptive reasoning decisions and align reasoning strategies with model capabilities.
- **Summary**: This paper introduces TATA (Teaching LLMs According to Their Aptitude), a framework for improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities.  Existing methods typically rely solely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR), each with limitations. TATA aims to adaptively choose between CoT and TIR based on the LLM's inherent strengths.  This is achieved through a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process where the training data is selectively chosen based on the LLM's performance on an "anchor set" of problems.  The anchor set allows the system to assess which reasoning method (CoT or TIR) works better for different problem types and to tailor the training data accordingly. Experiments across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that TATA achieves comparable or better performance than using CoT or TIR alone, often with improved inference efficiency.  Ablation studies highlight the importance of the aptitude-aware data selection process.  The authors also explore the potential of reinforcement learning to further refine the model's ability to choose between CoT and TIR.


**Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**

The paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of large language model (LLM) reasoning, particularly in the context of mathematical problem-solving.  The core idea of adaptively selecting between CoT and TIR based on the LLM's aptitude is novel and addresses a clear limitation of previous approaches that relied on fixed strategies or external selection mechanisms. The use of an anchor set for aptitude assessment and data selection is an innovative approach to personalize the SFT process.  The empirical results demonstrating improved performance and efficiency are compelling.

However, the novelty is not groundbreaking. The individual components â€“ CoT, TIR, SFT, and data selection â€“ are well-established techniques.  TATA's novelty lies in the specific combination and the ingenious use of the anchor set for adaptive data selection during SFT.  The experimental evaluation is thorough, but it primarily focuses on mathematical problems. The generalizability of the approach to other reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored.  Furthermore, the reliance on GPT-4 for the TIR conversion process raises questions about the scalability and potential biases introduced.  While the exploration of reinforcement learning is promising, it is only preliminary.


Considering the above, the paper demonstrates a significant advancement in LLM mathematical reasoning.  However, its broader impact on the field is limited by its current focus and the relative maturity of its component techniques.  The innovative combination and thorough experimentation deserve recognition, but the lack of extensive exploration beyond mathematical reasoning and potential scalability concerns prevent it from being a truly exceptional contribution.

### SafeChain: Safety of Language Models with Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12025v1)
- **Authors**: Fengqing Jiang, Zhangchen Xu, Yuetai Li, Luyao Niu, Zhen Xiang, Bo Li, Bill Yuchen Lin, Radha Poovendran
- **Abstract**: Emerging large reasoning models (LRMs), such as DeepSeek-R1 models, leverage long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate structured intermediate steps, enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, long CoT does not inherently guarantee safe outputs, potentially leading to harmful consequences such as the introduction of security vulnerabilities in code or the spread of misinformation. Current research on large language model (LLM) safety usually focuses on short-answer responses, overlooking the long CoT style outputs of LRMs. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of LRM safety. First, we investigate safety evaluators calibrated against human annotations. Using our newly developed metrics, we thoroughly assess the safety of 12 state-of-the-art LRMs on StrongReject and WildJailbreak datasets. Our results show that LRMs are not safe compared to their reasoning advance. Further, we perform a fine-grained analysis of the reasoning trace and final answer. We find that three decoding strategies-ZeroThink, LessThink, and MoreThink-can improve model safety without additional training. However, these strategies either use constrained reasoning traces or incur high inference costs. To better strengthen LRM safety, we introduce SafeChain, the first-of-its-kind safety training dataset in CoT style. We fine-tune two LRMs with SafeChain, showing that it not only enhances model safety but also preserves performance across 6 reasoning benchmarks.
- **Summary**: This paper, "SafeChain: Safety of Language Models with Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Capabilities," investigates the safety of large reasoning models (LRMs) that utilize long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning.  The authors find that longer CoT reasoning doesn't inherently guarantee safer outputs.  They conduct a systematic safety evaluation of several state-of-the-art LRMs using established and newly developed metrics on datasets like StrongReject and WildJailbreak, revealing that current LRMs are not sufficiently safe.  They explore prompting strategies (ZeroThink, LessThink, MoreThink) to improve safety without retraining, finding that ZeroThink, while limiting CoT, yields the best results.  To address the safety limitations, the authors introduce SAFECHAIN, a novel CoT-style safety training dataset.  Fine-tuning LRMs with SAFECHAIN improves their safety performance while largely maintaining their reasoning capabilities across various benchmarks.  The paper concludes by highlighting the need for further research in multilingual safety evaluation and multi-turn interactions with LRMs.


**Novelty and Significance:**

The paper makes a significant contribution by directly addressing the gap in LLM safety research regarding long CoT reasoning.  The development of SAFECHAIN is a notable contribution, as it's the first dataset specifically designed for safety training in the context of long CoT. The systematic evaluation of various LRMs and the exploration of prompting strategies to improve safety without retraining are also valuable contributions. However, the paper's novelty is somewhat limited by the reliance on existing safety evaluators and benchmarks. While the adaptation to the long CoT context is important, the core methodology of safety evaluation isn't groundbreaking. The findings, while valuable, are also somewhat predictable, given the existing concerns surrounding LLM safety.


**Strengths:**

* **Addresses a crucial gap:** The focus on long CoT reasoning in LLMs is timely and relevant given the rapid advancements in this area.
* **Comprehensive evaluation:** The paper provides a detailed and systematic evaluation of multiple LRMs using various metrics and datasets.
* **Novel dataset:** The creation of SAFECHAIN is a significant contribution to the field, providing a valuable resource for future research.
* **Practical strategies:** The exploration of prompting strategies offers practical solutions for improving LLM safety without requiring extensive retraining.


**Weaknesses:**

* **Limited novelty in core methodology:** The fundamental approach to safety evaluation leverages existing techniques, limiting the groundbreaking aspects of the research.
* **Potential for bias:** The reliance on specific models and datasets could introduce bias into the results. More diverse datasets and model architectures should be considered for future research.
* **Overemphasis on specific evaluators:** While Llama-Guard performed well, relying solely on one evaluator might limit the generalizability of the findings.


**Potential Influence:**

The paper's influence on the field will likely stem from the introduction of SAFECHAIN and the highlighted need for more research on LLM safety in the context of long CoT.  SAFECHAIN itself will serve as a valuable resource for future safety research. The paper's findings will also contribute to a growing understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in ensuring safe and responsible LLM development.
