- **Abstract**: Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper "UltraIF: Advancing Instruction Following from the Wild":** The paper introduces UltraIF, a novel method designed to enhance instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using open-source data. Notably, it addresses the existing performance gap between open-source LLMs and those developed by leading organizations. UltraIF operates by breaking down complex user prompts into simpler components, specifically queries and constraints, alongside evaluation questions to test these constraints. It employs a component termed UltraComposer to generate new prompts aligned with the constraints and evaluation metrics. The authors demonstrate that their approach allows a base version of LLaMA-3.1-8B to match performance levels of its instruct-tuned variant across five instruction-following benchmarks without prior external benchmark knowledge. Furthermore, the methodology shows promise for enhancing LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, suggesting new avenues for broader applications of UltraIF. The authors affirm that the code will be made publicly available for further research. --- **Critical Evaluation:** Novelty and Significance: 1. **Novelty**: UltraIF introduces a structured method for decomposing complex instructions, which is a commendable innovation in addressing the instruction-following challenges in LLMs. The UltraComposer mechanism for creating constraint-associated prompts is a significant contribution that could inspire future research in prompt engineering. However, the approach conceptually aligns with existing methodologies in prompt tuning and model alignment. Thus, while innovative, it does not significantly break new ground as a concept. 2. **Significance**: The results presented are promising, demonstrating that a relatively small model (LLaMA-3.1-8B) can achieve competitive performance comparable to larger or specially trained versions. This could democratize access to high-performing instruction-following capabilities, providing a potential advantage to the open-source community. However, the impact is somewhat limited until further validation across more diverse tasks and benchmarks. Strengths: - The approach offers a systematic way to improve model capabilities without necessitating proprietary data or extensive resources. - The experimental results are solid, showcasing a successful alignment of performance between different model versions. - The intention to make the code accessible promotes community engagement and potential for further exploration. Weaknesses: - The reliance on decomposing instructions may not generalize across all potential use cases, especially those requiring a nuanced understanding of context or ambiguity in instruction. - The paper does not deeply explore the long-term implications of the improvements and their applicability across various domains. - The lack of comparative analysis with other recent techniques diminishes the contextual understanding of how UltraIF positions itself within the current landscape of LLM advancements. Overall, while UltraIF presents a thoughtful advancement in the domain of instruction-following in LLMs and holds promise for practical applications, the novelty is somewhat diluted by existing literature. The contribution, while beneficial for the open-source ecosystem, may not represent a paradigm shift that is groundbreaking in its impact. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04182v1)
- **Authors**: Jade Garcia Bourrée, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Erwan Le Merrer, Othmane Safsafi
- **Abstract**: We address the problem of watermarking graph objects, which consists in hiding information within them, to prove their origin. The two existing methods to watermark graphs use subgraph matching or graph isomorphism techniques, which are known to be intractable for large graphs. To reduce the operational complexity, we propose FFG, a new graph watermarking scheme adapted from an image watermarking scheme, since graphs and images can be represented as matrices. We analyze and compare FFG, whose novelty lies in embedding the watermark in the Fourier transform of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Our technique enjoys a much lower complexity than that of related works (i.e. in $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2 \log N\right)$), while performing better or at least as well as the two state-of-the-art methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents FFG, a novel graph watermarking scheme that improves upon existing methods by addressing the computational challenges of watermarking large graphs. Traditional methods rely on subgraph matching and graph isomorphism, which are computationally intensive. FFG leverages techniques from image watermarking, specifically embedding watermarks within the Fourier transform of a graph's adjacency matrix. This results in significantly lower operational complexity (in $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$) while maintaining or improving performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of graph watermarking by introducing a new methodology that effectively reduces computational overhead, which is a critical concern for practical applications of watermarking in large-scale graphs. Its novel approach of utilizing the Fourier transform distinguishes it from previous methods, potentially expanding the toolkit available to researchers and practitioners dealing with graph data. **Strengths:** 1. **Reduced Complexity:** The algorithm’s operational complexity is a significant improvement over traditional methods, which may struggle with large datasets. This enhancement broadens the applicability of watermarking in real-world scenarios. 2. **Novelty in Approach:** By adapting techniques from image processing, the paper showcases an innovative cross-domain application, which is a sign of creativity and thorough exploration of possible solutions. 3. **Performance Benchmarks:** The authors provide comparative results demonstrating that FFG performs at least as well as existing methods, lending credibility to the claims of its efficacy. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Discussion on Trade-offs:** While the complexity reduction is well-articulated, the paper could provide a more thorough exploration of potential trade-offs, such as robustness or security of the watermark in comparison to existing techniques. 2. **Scope of Application:** The generalizability of the method to various types of graphs and its performance in diverse real-world scenarios should be examined more thoroughly. This could include insights into any limitations related to graph topology or structure. 3. **Experimental Validation:** Although results are claimed to be superior or comparable, a more extensive set of experiments with diverse graph datasets would strengthen the validity of the conclusions drawn. **Score: 7**   The score reflects a strong contribution with innovative methodologies that significantly address a notable challenge in the field. However, the need for deeper analysis regarding trade-offs, scope, and validation reduces its impact somewhat. The paper adds valuable insights into graph watermarking, making it a noteworthy read for researchers interested in this domain, but some critical aspects warrant further exploration.

### Automated Microservice Pattern Instance Detection Using Infrastructure-as-Code Artifacts and Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04188v1)
- **Authors**: Carlos Eduardo Duarte
- **Abstract**: Documenting software architecture is essential to preserve architecture knowledge, even though it is frequently costly. Architecture pattern instances, including microservice pattern instances, provide important structural software information. Practitioners should document this information to prevent knowledge vaporization. However, architecture patterns may not be detectable by analyzing source code artifacts, requiring the analysis of other types of artifacts. Moreover, many existing pattern detection instance approaches are complex to extend. This article presents our ongoing PhD research, early experiments, and a prototype for a tool we call MicroPAD for automating the detection of microservice pattern instances. The prototype uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts to aid detection, aiming to keep costs low and maximize the scope of detectable patterns. Early experiments ran the prototype thrice in 22 GitHub projects. We verified that 83\% of the patterns that the prototype identified were in the project. The costs of detecting the pattern instances were minimal. These results indicate that the approach is likely viable and, by lowering the entry barrier to automating pattern instance detection, could help democratize developer access to this category of architecture knowledge. Finally, we present our overall research methodology, planned future work, and an overview of MicroPAD's potential industrial impact.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses a PhD research effort focused on automating the detection of microservice pattern instances using a prototype tool called MicroPAD. The tool harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts, facilitating the identification of architecture pattern instances. The authors highlight the significance of documenting such architectural knowledge to prevent loss over time. Initial experiments with MicroPAD on 22 GitHub projects showed positive results, with 83% of the detected patterns confirmed to be present, all while maintaining low detection costs. The paper outlines the research methodology, future work, and potential industrial applications of the tool, suggesting that it could democratize access to architectural knowledge in software development. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel approach in the domain of architectural pattern detection by integrating LLMs with IaC analysis. This approach represents a shift from conventional reliance on source code analysis, addressing a critical gap where certain architectural patterns are hidden from traditional inspection methods. The use of LLMs, well-noted for their contextual understanding, lends credibility to the detection process and presents an innovative angle for architecture analysis in software engineering. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Relevance:** The paper tackles an important issue of architecture documentation, which has significant implications for software maintenance and evolution. 2. **Early Results:** The preliminary findings showcase strong effectiveness and minimal cost, suggesting practical applicability. 3. **Innovative Approach:** Utilizing LLMs in conjunction with IaC offers a promising direction that blends cutting-edge technology with established software engineering practices. However, there are some weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the initial testing on 22 GitHub projects is informative, more extensive evaluations across diverse project types and sizes would strengthen the findings. 2. **Dependence on Early Frameworks:** The prototype is still in early development, and the scalability and robustness of the approach remain unproven against larger or more complex systems. 3. **Potential Over-reliance on LLMs:** While LLMs have shown promise, their performance can vary significantly across different domains and contexts, which may introduce challenges in consistent pattern detection. Overall, the potential influence of this research is notable due to its innovative intersection of LLMs with microservice architecture detection, which could reshape accessibility to nuanced architectural knowledge for developers. Based on the evaluation of the novelty, relevance, strengths, and weaknesses presented in this paper, I would assign it a score of **Score: 8**. This score reflects a significant but still developing contribution to the field, with strong early results that require further validation through broader and more rigorous testing.

### PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192v1)
- **Authors**: Mennatullah Siam
- **Abstract**: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. Such approaches have shown strong performance on benchmarks for referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks and show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks when evaluating both the pixel-level grounding and visual question answering. We propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call as PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?'' We show that grounding can coincide with object parts or location/appearance information. Code repository is at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation/.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?" investigates the effectiveness of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that utilize pixel-level grounding supervision. While current methods have shown promise in tasks like referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation, the authors find that these models struggle with visual question answering when evaluated on challenging benchmarks. Interestingly, they discover that MLLMs not trained with pixel-level grounding can outperform their counterparts in specific tasks. The paper introduces two new benchmarks and proposes simple baselines for extracting grounding information applicable to any MLLM, termed PixFoundation. The authors also explore how grounding can naturally emerge in MLLMs without direct training on grounding supervision, linking it to object parts and location/appearance information. A code repository accompanies the research for further exploration. **Critical Evaluation:** Novelty: The paper makes significant contributions by challenging the current narrative surrounding pixel-level grounding supervision in MLLMs. Its proposition that models can perform well without this supervision and the introduction of new benchmarks highlight a fresh perspective that questions existing methodologies. Significance: The findings suggest that the reliance on pixel-level grounding may not be as beneficial as previously thought. By providing evidence that MLLMs can succeed in grounding tasks without specialized training, the authors open avenues for future research and applications. The exploration of grounding's emergence based on inherent model capabilities rather than explicit training could influence subsequent studies in the area significantly. Strengths: 1. The identification of performance gaps in pixel-level MLLMs provides a critical lens on the utility of grounding supervision. 2. The introduction of new benchmarks could stimulate further research and testing in evaluating MLLMs, an essential area of growing interest. 3. The provision of simple baselines allows for practical implementation and testing, enhancing accessibility for other researchers. Weaknesses: 1. While the results show promise, the paper may require further validation across a wider range of models and tasks to solidify the conclusions. 2. The depth of analysis on how grounding emerges could be further elaborated, as it currently presents a conceptual overview without extensive empirical backing. Overall, the paper effectively challenges current understandings and presents valuable insights into MLLMs and pixel-level grounding, though additional data and validation could strengthen the arguments made. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s substantial novel insights and significance in reshaping perspectives on pixel-level vision foundation models, alongside its clear implications for future research directions, while noting potential areas for further exploration and validation.

### The Best Instruction-Tuning Data are Those That Fit
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04194v2)
- **Authors**: Dylan Zhang, Qirun Dai, Hao Peng
- **Abstract**: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training. We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper introduces **GRAPE**, a novel supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework designed to optimize the quality of instruction-tuning data for large language models (LLMs). Traditional methods often pair instructions with responses from diverse LLMs, which can lead to mismatches in distribution and, consequently, reduced model performance. GRAPE, on the other hand, selects the most suitable response for each instruction based on its alignment with the target model’s pretrained distribution, thus ensuring higher-quality data is used in training. The authors conduct experiments using fine-tuning on a range of models (LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Qwen2.5-7B) with GRAPE-selected data, achieving significant performance improvements compared to strong baselines and other data selection methods. Notably, GRAPE enhances model performance even when using less data and fewer training epochs, illustrating its efficiency and effectiveness. **Critical Evaluation:**   The paper presents a significant step forward in the field of instruction-tuning for LLMs. Its central innovation—selecting model responses based on their alignment with the target model's pretrained characteristics—addresses a critical issue in the SFT process. By tackling the challenges of data quality and model robustness, GRAPE demonstrates not just theoretical soundness but also empirical efficacy through rigorous experiments. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Framework:** GRAPE offers a unique approach to SFT by ensuring compatibility between training data and the target model, potentially leading to enhanced performance and efficiency. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors provide a robust set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of GRAPE across multiple benchmarks and models, showcasing its practical utility. 3. **Real-World Applicability:** The results indicate that GRAPE can outperform traditional approaches even in less-than-ideal training scenarios (e.g., less data, fewer epochs), making it relevant for various applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Discussion of Mechanisms:** While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of how the model selection process works and its underlying mechanisms. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the results are promising, further studies might be needed to assess how GRAPE performs across all types of LLMs and in different domains. The paper heavily relies on specific models and might not generalize broadly without additional validation. 3. **Potential Bias in Response Selection:** The approach assumes that responses selected based on frequency of alignment will always be the best, which may not hold in all contexts. More nuanced selection criteria could be explored. Given the advancements presented, the paper contributes meaningfully to the field, balancing innovation with practicality. However, there are areas where further investigation would enhance its comprehensiveness. **Score: 8**.  This score acknowledges significant novelty and practical implications for the area of fine-tuning for LLMs while also recognizing the need for more depth regarding the model mechanisms and broader generalizability. The work has the potential to influence future studies and applications in SFT while laying the groundwork for improved methodologies.

### "Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04204v1)
- **Authors**: Shaopeng Fu, Liang Ding, Di Wang
- **Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks presents a novel approach to enhancing the robustness of large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks—specifically focusing on adversarial suffixes. The authors propose that to effectively defend against jailbreaking with a suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it suffices to align the models using adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. The paper offers a theoretical framework analyzing adversarial in-context learning and establishes a generalization bound linking training and testing samples. Empirical validation shows a correlation between training practices and robustness against longer adversarial attacks. The study concludes that utilizing short-length adversarial training can efficiently bolster defenses against longer-length attacks, with accompanying experimental results supporting these claims. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its specific focus on the relationship between the length of adversarial training prompts and the resulting robustness against longer jailbreak attacks. This is a significant addition to the field, as it provides a theoretical underpinning paired with empirical evidence, which many other studies may lack. The insight that shorter adversarial training can effectively defend against longer attacks is an intriguing and potentially impactful strategy that might shift how practitioners approach adversarial training for LLMs. Nevertheless, there are several limitations to consider. Firstly, the focus on adversarial suffix attacks is relatively narrow; while this is an important area, the ecosystem of adversarial attacks is broad, and findings may not be generalizable to other types of attacks. Additionally, the empirical results depend on specific models and techniques—such attention could limit applicability across other LLM architectures or configurations. The theoretical component, while robust, could benefit from additional insight into real-world implications, such as computational efficiency or deployment logistics. Furthermore, as with many advancements in LLM resilience, the ethical implications of strengthening models against potential misuse (like jailbreaks) must be critically considered, and the community would benefit from expanded discourse on these dimensions. Overall, despite its limitations, the paper presents a clear advancement in understanding and mitigating adversarial attacks on LLMs. It has the potential to influence future research and practical applications in this area. **Score: 7**

### Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04210v1)
- **Authors**: Liang Wendong, Simon Buchholz, Bernhard Schölkopf
- **Abstract**: We explore the relationship between causality, symmetry, and compression. We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Algorithmic causal structure emerging through compression" delves into the interplay between causality, symmetry, and the concept of compression in data analysis. The authors extend the existing link between learning and compression into contexts where causal models struggle to achieve identifiable outcomes. They introduce a novel framework in which causality arises from the compression of data across different environments, defining algorithmic causality for scenarios lacking traditional causal identifiability assumptions. Their findings suggest that causal and symmetric structures can be discerned by minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, even in the absence of intervention knowledge. The authors posit that their insights could shed light on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, like large language models, where identifying causal relationships is challenging. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper presents a fresh perspective by linking causality with compression in a non-identifiable setting, which is a significant contribution to our understanding of causal inference. 2. **Generalization of Existing Frameworks:** The authors build upon established theories and extend their applicability to more complex scenarios, which could foster further research in algorithmic causality. 3. **Interdisciplinary Implications:** The relationship drawn between compression and causality could inform current studies in machine learning, especially given the field's tendency to grapple with hidden causal relationships in large datasets. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Conceptual Complexity:** The concepts of algorithmic causality and Kolmogorov complexity can be notoriously difficult to grasp. The paper may not adequately address the practical applications of these concepts, potentially limiting its accessibility to a broader audience. 2. **Lack of Empirical Validation:** While theoretical contributions are valuable, the absence of empirical studies or simulations to validate the proposed framework diminishes the practical implications of the findings. 3. **Assumptions on Environments:** The reliance on multi-environmental data could be problematic, as not all datasets may lend themselves to this approach. The limitations of this requirement need to be more explicitly outlined. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents compelling theoretical advancements in understanding causality through compression, an area that holds considerable relevance for both theoretical and applied aspects of machine learning. However, its complexity and lack of empirical validation may hinder its immediate impact. A judicious balance between theoretical innovation and practical applicability will be essential for maximizing its influence. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's potential to significantly contribute to the field's understanding of causality while recognizing the need for clearer practical applications and empirical support.

### Sports and Women's Sports: Gender Bias in Text Generation with Olympic Data
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04218v1)
- **Authors**: Laura Biester
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be biased in prior work, as they generate text that is in line with stereotypical views of the world or that is not representative of the viewpoints and values of historically marginalized demographic groups. In this work, we propose using data from parallel men's and women's events at the Olympic Games to investigate different forms of gender bias in language models. We define three metrics to measure bias, and find that models are consistently biased against women when the gender is ambiguous in the prompt. In this case, the model frequently retrieves only the results of the men's event with or without acknowledging them as such, revealing pervasive gender bias in LLMs in the context of athletics.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper examines gender bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) using Olympic Games data, specifically contrasting men's and women's sports events. The authors identify and define three metrics for measuring bias in text generation. Their findings reveal that when prompts are gender-neutral or ambiguous, LLMs disproportionately favor male athletes, often referencing only men's events without proper acknowledgment. This study highlights pervasive gender bias in LLMs, underlining the need for more equitable representations in AI-generated content related to athletics. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its specific focus on gender bias within the distinct context of athletic events at the Olympics, an area that hasn't been extensively explored in existing literature on biases in LLMs. By utilizing a concrete dataset of comparable events and establishing clear metrics for measuring bias, the authors offer a rigorous methodological framework that could serve as a foundation for future research. However, the paper has limitations that impact its overall significance. The focus is somewhat narrow, as it primarily examines only one context (Olympic sports) and doesn’t explore the broader implications of these biases across different areas of text generation. Additionally, while the findings are critical, they may be seen as an extension of previously established problems of bias, rather than a groundbreaking revelation. The paper could also benefit from a deeper discussion on potential remedies or mitigations for the observed biases, giving it practical relevance beyond the identification of the problem. Overall, while the findings are important and add to the discussion of bias in AI, the limitations in scope and depth of analysis lessen the overall contribution to the field. **Score: 6**   This score reflects a moderate level of novelty and significance, as the research is valuable and necessary but does not profoundly change the understanding of bias in LLMs. The focus on a specific domain is commendable but is balanced by the lack of broader application or proposed solutions, which diminishes its impact.

### Assessing and Prioritizing Ransomware Risk Based on Historical Victim Data
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04421v1)
- **Authors**: Spencer Massengale, Philip Huff
- **Abstract**: We present an approach to identifying which ransomware adversaries are most likely to target specific entities, thereby assisting these entities in formulating better protection strategies. Ransomware poses a formidable cybersecurity threat characterized by profit-driven motives, a complex underlying economy supporting criminal syndicates, and the overt nature of its attacks. This type of malware has consistently ranked among the most prevalent, with a rapid escalation in activity observed. Recent estimates indicate that approximately two-thirds of organizations experienced ransomware attacks in 2023 \cite{Sophos2023Ransomware}. A central tactic in ransomware campaigns is publicizing attacks to coerce victims into paying ransoms. Our study utilizes public disclosures from ransomware victims to predict the likelihood of an entity being targeted by a specific ransomware variant. We employ a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that uses a unique chain-of-thought, multi-shot prompt methodology to define adversary SKRAM (Skills, Knowledge, Resources, Authorities, and Motivation) profiles from ransomware bulletins, threat reports, and news items. This analysis is enriched with publicly available victim data and is further enhanced by a heuristic for generating synthetic data that reflects victim profiles. Our work culminates in the development of a machine learning model that assists organizations in prioritizing ransomware threats and formulating defenses based on the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the most likely attackers.
- **Summary**: ### Summary  The paper titled "Assessing and Prioritizing Ransomware Risk Based on Historical Victim Data" addresses the pressing issue of ransomware attacks by providing a framework to forecast the likelihood of specific entities being targeted based on historical data. The authors highlight the increasing prevalence of ransomware, with significant impacts observed over the years, including an alarming rate affecting two-thirds of organizations in 2023. The study presents a methodology that combines a Large Language Model (LLM) with a unique chain-of-thought prompting approach to analyze and create adversary profiles. This includes assessing cybercriminal capabilities based on insights from ransomware bulletins, threat reports, and media sources. Key to the research is a machine learning model that helps organizations prioritize threats and enhance their defensive strategies by understanding the tactics and motivations of potential attackers through enriched victim data and synthetic data generation.  ### Critical Evaluation  **Novelty:** The paper introduces a significant approach to ransomware threat assessment by connecting historical victim data and predictive analytics. The use of an LLM to define adversary profiles specific to ransomware seems novel and adds a level of sophistication to traditional threat modelling methods. However, the concept of predicting threats based on historical data is not entirely new; previous research has laid the groundwork for this type of analysis. Nevertheless, the integration of public data and the specific focus on adversary SKRAM profiles provide a fresh perspective. **Significance:** The research has practical implications for cybersecurity, particularly for organizations vulnerable to ransomware. By assisting in the identification of high-risk scenarios, the model enables organizations to allocate resources more efficiently and react proactively, which could help mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks. The timeliness of this research in light of rising ransomware threats further enhances its significance. **Strengths:** 1. **Current Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical and contemporary issue in cybersecurity, making it timely and relevant. 2. **Innovative Methodology:** The interplay of LLMs and a structured adversary profiling system demonstrates ingenuity in tackling complex data. 3. **Practical Application:** The focus on actionable outcomes for organizations bolsters its relevance to practitioners in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the model is based on historical data, its effectiveness in predicting new or emerging ransomware variants or attackers may be limited, given the evolving nature of cyber threats. 2. **Data Limitations:** The reliance on publicly available data could introduce biases or gaps in understanding the full scope of ransomware threats. 3. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the methodology is conceptually sound, practical implementation in diverse organizational settings may face challenges, especially for smaller entities with less robust data infrastructures. ### Score: 8  **Rationale:** The paper merits an 8 due to its innovative combination of existing research and practical application to current cybersecurity issues. While it builds on established concepts, the use of LLMs to create predictive models for ransomware adversarial profiling is a notable advance. The practical implications for stakeholders in the cybersecurity landscape add significant value. However, inherent limitations in data reliance and the potential for implementation challenges prevent it from achieving a perfect score, indicating areas for further refinement and investigation. Overall, the paper contributes meaningfully to the ongoing discourse in the field of cybersecurity risk assessment.

- **Authors**: He Hu, Yucheng Zhou, Lianzhong You, Hongbo Xu, Qianning Wang, Zheng Lian, Fei Richard Yu, Fei Ma, Laizhong Cui
- **Abstract**: With the integration of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into robotic systems and various AI applications, embedding emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities into these models is essential for enabling robots to effectively address human emotional needs and interact seamlessly in real-world scenarios. Existing static, text-based, or text-image benchmarks overlook the multimodal complexities of real-world interactions and fail to capture the dynamic, multimodal nature of emotional expressions, making them inadequate for evaluating MLLMs' EI. Based on established psychological theories of EI, we build EmoBench-M, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the EI capability of MLLMs across 13 valuation scenarios from three key dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. Evaluations of both open-source and closed-source MLLMs on EmoBench-M reveal a significant performance gap between them and humans, highlighting the need to further advance their EI capabilities. All benchmark resources, including code and datasets, are publicly available at https://emo-gml.github.io/.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces EmoBench-M, a benchmark designed for assessing the emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current benchmarks focusing on static, text-based, or text-image evaluations fail to address the dynamic and multimodal nature of human emotional expressions. EmoBench-M is built upon psychological theories of EI and evaluates MLLMs across 13 scenarios, emphasizing three dimensions: foundational emotion recognition, conversational emotion understanding, and socially complex emotion analysis. The authors demonstrate a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human emotional intelligence through their evaluations, suggesting a pressing need for advancements in this area. All related resources are publicly accessible. **Evaluation:** The paper's novelty lies in its targeted focus on multimodal emotional intelligence, a crucial element as AI systems increasingly interact in human-centric environments. By addressing a clear gap in existing evaluation methods for MLLMs, it establishes a framework that encourages both researchers and developers to improve EI in robots and AI applications. The integration of psychological theories into the benchmarking scenarios gives the approach a solid theoretical foundation, which enhances its credibility. However, the paper's strength also reflects tensions in the field. While it shows a significant performance gap between MLLMs and humans, it stops short of offering comprehensive solutions or methodologies for closing this gap. The implications of the benchmark may also hinge on broad adoption, and it remains to be seen how influential it will be at scale, as uptake in the research community is often variable. Furthermore, while accessible resources add value and transparency, the benchmark's future impact depends on its usability in real-world applications and subsequent research. Despite these considerations, the paper offers a meaningful contribution by outlining a novel evaluation framework focusing on emotional intelligence—a relatively underexplored area for MLLMs. Thus, the work is commendable for its innovation and practical relevance. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Edoardo Loru, Jacopo Nudo, Niccolò Di Marco, Matteo Cinelli, Walter Quattrociocchi
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assess news credibility, yet little is known about how they make these judgments. While prior research has examined political bias in LLM outputs or their potential for automated fact-checking, their internal evaluation processes remain largely unexamined. Understanding how LLMs assess credibility provides insights into AI behavior and how credibility is structured and applied in large-scale language models. This study benchmarks the reliability and political classifications of state-of-the-art LLMs - Gemini 1.5 Flash (Google), GPT-4o mini (OpenAI), and LLaMA 3.1 (Meta) - against structured, expert-driven rating systems such as NewsGuard and Media Bias Fact Check. Beyond assessing classification performance, we analyze the linguistic markers that shape LLM decisions, identifying which words and concepts drive their evaluations. We uncover patterns in how LLMs associate credibility with specific linguistic features by examining keyword frequency, contextual determinants, and rank distributions. Beyond static classification, we introduce a framework in which LLMs refine their credibility assessments by retrieving external information, querying other models, and adapting their responses. This allows us to investigate whether their assessments reflect structured reasoning or rely primarily on prior learned associations.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Decoding AI Judgment: How LLMs Assess News Credibility and Bias" investigates the largely unexplored processes that Large Language Models (LLMs) use to evaluate the credibility of news sources. The authors benchmark three state-of-the-art LLMs—Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-4o mini, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1—against established expert-driven rating systems like NewsGuard and Media Bias Fact Check to assess their reliability and political classifications.  The study goes further to analyze the linguistic features that influence these models' evaluations, identifying specific keywords and concepts linked to credibility assessments. By exploring factors such as keyword frequency and context, as well as introducing a novel framework whereby LLMs adapt their assessments through external information retrieval, the study aims to establish whether LLMs use structured reasoning or lean on prior learned associations when judging credibility. ### Evaluation #### Novelty The novelty of this paper is notable, as it fills a significant gap in current research about how LLMs evaluate news credibility—an important aspect given the increasing role of AI in information dissemination. While many studies have focused on bias in AI outputs and automated fact-checking, this paper takes a deeper dive into the internal mechanisms of LLMs, which adds a valuable layer of understanding to the field. #### Significance The significance of the findings is underscored by the pressing need for transparency in AI decision-making processes, particularly as they are integrated into news assessment and public discourse. By aligning LLM outputs with structured expert evaluations, the paper provides insights that could potentially influence the design of future LLMs and guide policymakers in regulating AI technologies. #### Strengths - **Fresh Perspective**: The focus on linguistic markers and the framework for assessing LLM decision-making adds depth to the understanding of AI credibility assessments. - **Benchmarking**: The comparative analysis among leading LLMs against established standards offers a rigorous methodology that enhances the reliability of the findings. - **Practical Implications**: The implications for improving LLM models and their applications in real-world settings are significant, as they potentially inform both theoretical advancements and practical applications. #### Weaknesses - **Scope**: While the benchmarks used are credible, the study may be limited in its generalizability due to the restricted number of LLMs analyzed. Including a broader array of models could strengthen the findings. - **Complexity**: Exploring how contextual determinants influence LLM assessments can be challenging, and the framework proposed may require extensive validation in varied scenarios to demonstrate practicality. - **Temporal Relevance**: As LLM technology evolves rapidly, findings could become outdated quickly. Regular updates and longitudinal studies would enhance durability. #### Conclusion Overall, the paper presents a rigorous and insightful analysis of LLMs and how they approach the assessment of news credibility and bias. Its novel approach, combined with practical implications for the field of AI and media literacy, contributes important knowledge to an area of critical social relevance. **Score: 8**

### Confident or Seek Stronger: Exploring Uncertainty-Based On-device LLM Routing From Benchmarking to Generalization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04428v1)
- **Authors**: Yu-Neng Chuang, Leisheng Yu, Guanchu Wang, Lizhe Zhang, Zirui Liu, Xuanting Cai, Yang Sui, Vladimir Braverman, Xia Hu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed and democratized on edge devices. To improve the efficiency of on-device deployment, small language models (SLMs) are often adopted due to their efficient decoding latency and reduced energy consumption. However, these SLMs often generate inaccurate responses when handling complex queries. One promising solution is uncertainty-based SLM routing, offloading high-stakes queries to stronger LLMs when resulting in low-confidence responses on SLM. This follows the principle of "If you lack confidence, seek stronger support" to enhance reliability. Relying on more powerful LLMs is yet effective but increases invocation costs. Therefore, striking a routing balance between efficiency and efficacy remains a critical challenge. Additionally, efficiently generalizing the routing strategy to new datasets remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into benchmarking and generalization of uncertainty-driven routing strategies from SLMs to LLMs over 1500+ settings. Our findings highlight: First, uncertainty-correctness alignment in different uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods significantly impacts routing performance. Second, uncertainty distributions depend more on both the specific SLM and the chosen UQ method, rather than downstream data. Building on the insight, we propose a calibration data construction instruction pipeline and open-source a constructed hold-out set to enhance routing generalization on new downstream scenarios. The experimental results indicate calibration data effectively bootstraps routing performance without any new data.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Confident or Seek Stronger: Exploring Uncertainty-Based On-device LLM Routing From Benchmarking to Generalization" addresses the deployment of large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) on edge devices, focusing on improving efficiency while maintaining response accuracy. The authors propose an uncertainty-based routing strategy that offloads complex, low-confidence queries from SLMs to more powerful LLMs, aiming to enhance reliability without incurring high costs. They explore the performance of routing strategies through extensive benchmarking across over 1500 settings and find that the alignment of uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods with correctness significantly influences routing effectiveness. The paper emphasizes that uncertainty distributions are more dependent on the specifics of the SLM and UQ methods than on downstream data. To further aid in routing generalization to new datasets, the authors introduce a calibration data construction pipeline and provide an open-source hold-out set. Experimental results demonstrate that this calibration data positively impacts routing performance. **Evaluation:** The paper presents several strengths: 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The use of uncertainty-based routing strategies to balance efficiency and reliability in deploying SLMs alongside LLMs offers a fresh perspective on handling complex queries in real-world applications. 2. **Comprehensive Benchmarking:** Conducting a wide-ranging investigation across 1500+ settings gives the findings robustness and depth, providing valuable insights into routing performance and uncertainty quantification. 3. **Practical Contributions:** The introduction of a calibration data construction pipeline and the provision of an open-source hold-out set are significant contributions that offer practical tools to the research community. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Cost Versus Efficiency Trade-off:** While the paper discusses the trade-off between invocation costs and routing efficacy, it could deepen its analysis on how to optimize this balance practically for different applications. 2. **Generalization Insight:** Although the authors indicate that SLM and UQ method characteristics drive uncertainty distributions, more empirical evidence could strengthen this assertion, perhaps through case studies or application scenarios that demonstrate varying performance. 3. **Limited Novelty in UQ Methods:** Many existing methods for uncertainty quantification have already been explored in different contexts. The paper primarily focuses on application rather than introducing novel UQ methodologies, which may lessen its novelty in the broader field of LLM research. Taking these strengths and weaknesses into account, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field of on-device LLM research, but it doesn’t entirely break new ground in terms of theoretical advancements. Therefore, it merits a score that reflects its practical benefits and insightful benchmarking while considering its limitations. **Score: 7**

### Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04463v1)
- **Authors**: Daman Arora, Andrea Zanette
- **Abstract**: Scaling model size and training data has led to great advances in the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the diminishing returns of this approach necessitate alternative methods to improve model capabilities, particularly in tasks requiring advanced reasoning. Large reasoning models, which leverage long chain-of-thoughts, bring unprecedented breakthroughs in problem-solving capabilities but at a substantial deployment cost associated to longer generations. Reducing inference costs is crucial for the economic feasibility, user experience, and environmental sustainability of these models. In this work, we propose to train large reasoning models to reason efficiently. More precisely, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train reasoning models to dynamically allocate inference-time compute based on task complexity. Our method incentivizes models to minimize unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, thereby achieving substantial efficiency gains. It enables the derivation of a family of reasoning models with varying efficiency levels, controlled via a single hyperparameter. Experiments on two open-weight large reasoning models demonstrate significant reductions in inference cost while preserving most of the accuracy.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Training Language Models to Reason Efficiently" addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) that scale in size and data, identifying diminishing returns for tasks requiring sophisticated reasoning. Such reasoning models, which utilize extended chain-of-thought processes, yield remarkable advances but incur high deployment costs due to the increased computational resources needed for their longer response generations. To tackle this challenge, the authors propose a novel approach utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to train these reasoning models to allocate computational resources dynamically, based on the complexity of the task at hand. By incentivizing efficiency while maintaining accuracy, their method allows for the creation of a suite of reasoning models exhibiting varying efficiency levels governed by a single tunable hyperparameter. Experiments conducted on two open-weight large reasoning models showcase significant reductions in inference costs without a substantial compromise in accuracy. ### Critical Evaluation The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its integration of reinforcement learning techniques to optimize resource allocation for reasoning models specifically. By focusing on inference cost reduction while preserving model performance, the authors present a compelling alternative to the traditional scaling approach.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The application of RL to manage computational resources dynamically is a relatively underexplored direction in LLM development, addressing a critical pain point in deploying complex models. 2. **Practicality**: The focus on inference cost and sustainability makes the research timely and relevant, considering the growing scrutiny regarding the environmental impact of large models. 3. **Flexibility**: The ability to control efficiency levels through a hyperparameter adjustment offers practical usability, allowing practitioners to tailor models to their specific requirements. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the experiments demonstrate improvements on specific models, the results may not be easily transferrable to all reasoning tasks or models. There is a risk that the approach works better in specific contexts rather than universally. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper should have provided more comprehensive evaluations beyond mere computational savings and accuracy, such as user experience or real-world applicability. 3. **Implementation Complexity**: The addition of reinforcement learning might introduce additional complexity in the training and fine-tuning phases, potentially outbalancing the benefits gained from efficiency. In conclusion, the paper introduces a significant step towards resolving practical challenges faced by large reasoning models. By focusing on efficient reasoning through dynamic inference management, it holds promise for both research and application. Nonetheless, the effectiveness and practicality of the approach in diverse settings require further exploration. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Luca Della Libera, Francesco Paissan, Cem Subakan, Mirco Ravanelli
- **Abstract**: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing through self-supervised pretraining on massive datasets. Inspired by this success, researchers have explored adapting these methods to speech by discretizing continuous audio into tokens using neural audio codecs. However, existing approaches face limitations, including high bitrates, the loss of either semantic or acoustic information, and the reliance on multi-codebook designs when trying to capture both, which increases architectural complexity for downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce FocalCodec, an efficient low-bitrate codec based on focal modulation that utilizes a single binary codebook to compress speech between 0.16 and 0.65 kbps. FocalCodec delivers competitive performance in speech resynthesis and voice conversion at lower bitrates than the current state-of-the-art, while effectively handling multilingual speech and noisy environments. Evaluation on downstream tasks shows that FocalCodec successfully preserves sufficient semantic and acoustic information, while also being well-suited for generative modeling. Demo samples, code and checkpoints are available at https://lucadellalib.github.io/focalcodec-web/.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces FocalCodec, a novel low-bitrate speech coding method that leverages focal modulation networks to compress speech signals. Current speech coding solutions often require high bitrates, complicate architecture, and struggle with maintaining both semantic and acoustic fidelity, especially when dealing with multi-codebook designs. FocalCodec overcomes these challenges by using a single binary codebook to compress speech signals to a bitrate range of 0.16 to 0.65 kbps. It demonstrates competitive performance in tasks such as speech resynthesis and voice conversion while effectively managing multilingual speech and noisy conditions. The codec preserves essential semantic and acoustic features, making it suitable for generative modeling. Demos, code, and checkpoints are provided online for further exploration. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** FocalCodec presents a novel approach to low-bitrate speech coding by integrating focal modulation, which differentiates it from existing methods that often employ complex multi-codebook designs. By introducing a single binary codebook, the authors simplify the architecture and optimize bitrate efficiency. This focus on both semantic and acoustic integrity at low bitrates is relatively underexplored in the literature, thus marking a noteworthy innovation. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential applications in various speech-related tasks, especially in environments or conditions where bandwidth is limited. Given the growing demand for efficient speech processing technologies in areas like telecommunication and assistive technologies, this codec could influence the development of future coders that are both efficient and effective. **Strengths:** 1. **Efficiency**: The reduction in bitrate without significant loss of information is a substantial advantage. 2. **Simplified Architecture**: Using a single binary codebook decreases complexity, making it easier for practitioners to implement. 3. **Versatility**: The codec’s performance across multilingual and noisy environments demonstrates its practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparisons**: While the proposed methods show improvements, specific comparisons with a broader range of baseline models could offer further insights into the advantages of FocalCodec. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The metrics used for evaluating performance in tasks such as speech resynthesis may need additional clarification or expansion to fully gauge the codec’s effectiveness across different applications. **Potential Influence:** This work has the potential to influence future research in speech coding, particularly in the context of low-bitrate applications. However, its impact will depend on further validations and acceptance within the community. Overall, while the paper offers a promising advancement in low-bitrate speech coding, it could benefit from more comprehensive evaluations and comparisons to solidify its standing in the field.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s high novelty and potential impact, tempered by the need for more extensive comparative analysis and explicit performance evaluations.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using the $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.

### Augmented Conditioning Is Enough For Effective Training Image Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04475v1)
- **Authors**: Jiahui Chen, Amy Zhang, Adriana Romero-Soriano
- **Abstract**: Image generation abilities of text-to-image diffusion models have significantly advanced, yielding highly photo-realistic images from descriptive text and increasing the viability of leveraging synthetic images to train computer vision models. To serve as effective training data, generated images must be highly realistic while also sufficiently diverse within the support of the target data distribution. Yet, state-of-the-art conditional image generation models have been primarily optimized for creative applications, prioritizing image realism and prompt adherence over conditional diversity. In this paper, we investigate how to improve the diversity of generated images with the goal of increasing their effectiveness to train downstream image classification models, without fine-tuning the image generation model. We find that conditioning the generation process on an augmented real image and text prompt produces generations that serve as effective synthetic datasets for downstream training. Conditioning on real training images contextualizes the generation process to produce images that are in-domain with the real image distribution, while data augmentations introduce visual diversity that improves the performance of the downstream classifier. We validate augmentation-conditioning on a total of five established long-tail and few-shot image classification benchmarks and show that leveraging augmentations to condition the generation process results in consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on the long-tailed benchmark and remarkable gains in extreme few-shot regimes of the remaining four benchmarks. These results constitute an important step towards effectively leveraging synthetic data for downstream training.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Augmented Conditioning Is Enough For Effective Training Image Generation" addresses the evolving capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly their use in generating synthetic images for training computer vision models. The authors argue that while existing models excel in realism and adherence to text prompts, they lack conditional diversity essential for training purposes. The paper introduces a novel approach that enhances diversity during the image generation process by conditioning it on both augmented real images and descriptive text prompts, thereby generating in-domain images with visual variety. They validate their approach across five benchmarks focused on long-tail and few-shot image classification, demonstrating significant improvements in performance. This method aims to close the gap between synthetic image generation and effective training data use in machine learning. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Relevance:** The research addresses a crucial challenge in leveraging synthetic data for machine learning, which is particularly pertinent given the increased use of generative models in various applications. 2. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of 'augmentation-conditioning' to enhance diversity is a unique contribution. It expands the typical framework of conditional generation by incorporating real images in combination with augmentations, thus broadening the scope of generated data. 3. **Comprehensive Validation:** The paper's evaluation across multiple established benchmarks adds credibility to its claims, suggesting that the proposed method reliably improves performance in diverse applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Augmentations:** While the paper discusses augmentations, it does not fully explore the variety of augmentation techniques that could be applied. This limits the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Potential Overfitting Risks:** Relying on augmented real images might lead to overfitting on certain datasets, which the paper does not adequately address, leaving questions about the robustness of the approach in broader applications. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a direct comparison with other recent advancements in generative modeling that emphasize diversity, which would contextualize its contributions more effectively. **Influence on the Field:** This paper has the potential to significantly influence practices in the field of computer vision by promoting the effective use of synthetic data for training classification models. By introducing a method that improves the conditional diversity of generated images, it encourages further exploration and research into the intersection of generative models and practical training applications. Overall, due to its novel approach, practical implications, and empirical validation, I assign the paper a score of **8**. While it presents a solid contribution, the weaknesses noted, especially regarding augmentation scope and potential risks, prevent it from being an outstanding or transformative addition to the field. **Score: 8**

### ADIFF: Explaining audio difference using natural language
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04476v1)
- **Authors**: Soham Deshmukh, Shuo Han, Rita Singh, Bhiksha Raj
- **Abstract**: Understanding and explaining differences between audio recordings is crucial for fields like audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. This involves identifying and describing audio events, acoustic scenes, signal characteristics, and their emotional impact on listeners. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio differences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we present two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the AudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise descriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio events, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive explanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we use prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to prompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies reveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar sounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations, we propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position captioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to produce detailed explanations. We evaluate our model using objective metrics and human evaluation and show our model enhancements lead to significant improvements in performance over naive baseline and SoTA Audio-Language Model (ALM) Qwen Audio. Lastly, we conduct multiple ablation studies to study the effects of cross-projection, language model parameters, position captioning, third stage fine-tuning, and present our findings. Our benchmarks, findings, and strong baseline pave the way for nuanced and human-like explanations of audio differences.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "ADIFF: Explaining audio difference using natural language" addresses the task of explaining differences between audio recordings, highlighting its relevance in audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. It proposes ADIFF, a model designed to provide comprehensive explanations of audio differences at three levels: concise descriptions of events, brief contextual sentences, and detailed semantic and emotional analyses. To support this work, the authors create two datasets derived from existing audio captioning collections. They employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate explanations and use a baseline approach that incorporates prefix tuning with audio embeddings. Empirical analyses reveal challenges with the baseline in distinguishing similar sounds and generating detailed explanations. To enhance performance, the authors introduce innovative components such as a cross-projection module and a three-step training process. Their evaluations confirm that ADIFF significantly outperforms both the baseline and the state-of-the-art model Qwen Audio, while ablation studies provide insights into the contributions of various enhancements. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its comprehensive approach to the relatively unexplored domain of audio difference explanation. While previous works have touched upon related concepts in audio analysis and natural language processing, this paper appears to be the first to create a structured framework that facilitates nuanced descriptions of audio differences at multiple levels. The introduction of specific datasets derived from established audio captioning work is another significant contribution, offering valuable resources for future studies. Strengths of the paper include its methodological rigor in developing the ADIFF model and its thorough evaluations that encompass both objective metrics and human assessments. The identification and addressing of limitations in existing models through careful ablation studies signifies a well-rounded research approach. Moreover, the application of advanced techniques like cross-projection and position captioning highlights the authors' innovative thinking in enhancing model capabilities. On the downside, the paper could strengthen its position by offering comparisons with a broader array of existing models beyond the immediately relevant SoTA ALM Qwen Audio. The report lacks extensive discussions on practical constraints in real-world applications of such explanations and their interpretability, which is crucial for fields like audio forensics where credibility and clarity are paramount. In terms of significance, this research has the potential to influence various fields by providing a framework and methodologies that allow for richer interpretations of audio data. Such advancements could enhance both theoretical research and practical applications in audio analysis. Considering all these factors, I would assign a score of **8** to this paper. While it presents a novel framework that significantly progresses the field of audio difference analysis, it may still benefit from deeper connections to existing literature and practical implications that would help to solidify its standing. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Luiz C. S. de Araujo, Carlos M. S. Figueiredo
- **Abstract**: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical problem in computer vision, essential for understanding how objects move and interact in videos. This field faces significant challenges such as occlusions and complex environmental dynamics, impacting model accuracy and efficiency. While traditional approaches have relied on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), introducing transformers has brought substantial advancements. This work introduces OneTrack-M, a transformer-based MOT model designed to enhance tracking computational efficiency and accuracy. Our approach simplifies the typical transformer-based architecture by eliminating the need for a decoder model for object detection and tracking. Instead, the encoder alone serves as the backbone for temporal data interpretation, significantly reducing processing time and increasing inference speed. Additionally, we employ innovative data pre-processing and multitask training techniques to address occlusion and diverse objective challenges within a single set of weights. Experimental results demonstrate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference times compared to state-of-the-art models in the literature while maintaining or improving tracking accuracy metrics. These improvements highlight the potential of the proposed solution for real-time applications such as autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and robotics, where rapid responses are crucial for system effectiveness.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents OneTrack-M, a novel transformer-based model for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) that aims to improve both computational efficiency and accuracy. Unlike traditional methods utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), OneTrack-M leverages a streamlined transformer architecture by utilizing only the encoder for object detection and tracking, thereby eliminating the need for a decoder. This design choice significantly enhances speed and reduces processing time for real-time applications. Furthermore, the authors implement advanced data pre-processing and multitask training strategies to tackle issues such as occlusions and object variability using a unified set of model weights. Empirical results indicate that OneTrack-M achieves at least 25% faster inference compared to leading models while achieving comparable or superior tracking accuracy. This advancement may prove beneficial in applications like autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics, where quick decision-making is essential. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**   The paper introduces a significant architectural modification to existing transformer models in the MOT domain by forgoing the decoder, which is generally essential in many transformer-based applications. This simplification is a compelling contribution because it directly addresses a known bottleneck—processing time—allowing for faster inference without sacrificing tracking accuracy. Additionally, the implementation of multitask learning to simultaneously address various challenges of MOT using shared weights is an intriguing angle that promotes efficiency. **Significance:**   The paper presents results that demonstrate a meaningful improvement in inference speed alongside maintaining tracking accuracy, which is critical for real-time applications. This could push the boundaries of MOT systems that currently struggle with real-time processing, thereby having potential implications across various fields requiring timely data interpretation.  **Strengths:**   1. The approach is methodologically sound, with clear experimental validation showing not just speed improvements but also competitive accuracy. 2. The model's design choices are well-reasoned and align with contemporary requirements in MOT applications. 3. The multitask training framework effectively exemplifies an innovative solution to common tracking challenges. **Weaknesses:**   1. While the model does perform well, further comparative evaluations with more recent and diverse state-of-the-art methods could strengthen its position. The authors should consider evaluating OneTrack-M against a wider range of benchmark datasets and scenarios. 2. The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of limitations, potential drawbacks of simplifying the architecture, and considerations for real-world complexities such as varying camera perspectives or environments. **Conclusion:**   Overall, OneTrack-M presents a significant advancement in the field of multi-object tracking by combining transformer architecture with practical enhancements for real-time application. While the contributions are notable, the depth of comparative analysis and discussion on limitations could be improved. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to the domain and its practical applications, balanced against the need for additional robustness in experimental validation and comprehensive discussion.

- **Abstract**: The last decade has seen widespread adoption of Machine Learning (ML) components in software systems. This has occurred in nearly every domain, from natural language processing to computer vision. These ML components range from relatively simple neural networks to complex and resource-intensive large language models. However, despite this widespread adoption, little is known about the supply chain relationships that produce these models, which can have implications for compliance and security. In this work, we conduct an extensive analysis of 760,460 models and 175,000 datasets mined from the popular model-sharing site Hugging Face. First, we evaluate the current state of documentation in the Hugging Face supply chain, report real-world examples of shortcomings, and offer actionable suggestions for improvement. Next, we analyze the underlying structure of the extant supply chain. Finally, we explore the current licensing landscape against what was reported in prior work and discuss the unique challenges posed in this domain. Our results motivate multiple research avenues, including the need for better license management for ML models/datasets, better support for model documentation, and automated inconsistency checking and validation. We make our research infrastructure and dataset available to facilitate future research.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "The ML Supply Chain in the Era of Software 2.0: Lessons Learned from Hugging Face" examines the supply chain of Machine Learning (ML) models, using data from Hugging Face, a prominent model-sharing platform. Over the past decade, ML components have proliferated across various domains, but little research has addressed the supply chain dynamics that lead to the development of these models, which can significantly impact compliance and security. The authors analyzed a massive dataset comprising 760,460 models and 175,000 datasets from Hugging Face, assessing the state of documentation, identifying shortcomings, and providing actionable suggestions for improvement. They mapped the supply chain structure, evaluated the current licensing framework, and discussed challenges in this landscape. Their findings highlight the need for enhanced license management, improved documentation, and automated validation processes, ultimately paving the way for further investigations in this critical area. The authors have made their research infrastructure and dataset publicly accessible for future studies. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a significant contribution by filling a notable gap in the understanding of the ML supply chain, particularly through the lens of a well-known platform like Hugging Face. This work is timely and relevant as ML models become increasingly critical in various software applications. By employing a data-driven approach, it presents a comprehensive analysis that not only highlights the issues in the existing documentation and licensing practices but also provides actionable insights. **Strengths:** 1. **Scope and Scale**: The analysis of over 760,000 models and 175,000 datasets presents a robust empirical foundation, offering a thorough overview of the landscape. 2. **Relevance**: With the rise of ML models and their integration into various sectors, understanding the supply chain dynamics is essential for compliance and security, thus enhancing the relevance of the research. 3. **Actionable Outcomes**: The identification of specific shortcomings and suggestions for improvement make the paper not just descriptive but also prescriptive, adding practical value to the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Depth of Analysis**: While the paper covers a broad range of issues, it may lack in-depth qualitative analysis of particular case studies, which could enrich the findings. 2. **Generalizability**: The reliance on a single platform may limit the generalizability of conclusions drawn, as different platforms might exhibit different dynamics in their supply chains. The significance of this paper lies in its potential to catalyze reforms within the ML community regarding documentation, licensing, and supply-chain transparency. By making its dataset available, the authors encourage further academic inquiry, which can amplify its impact. Given these considerations, I assign a score of **8**.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04485v1)
- **Authors**: Katarzyna Kobalczyk, Nicolas Astorga, Tennison Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar
- **Abstract**: Despite the impressive performance of large language models (LLMs) across various benchmarks, their ability to address ambiguously specified problems--frequent in real-world interactions--remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a formal definition of task ambiguity and frame the problem of task disambiguation through the lens of Bayesian Experimental Design. By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task specifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and reducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating effective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of meta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed approach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted questions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts the load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that this form of question selection leads to more effective task disambiguation in comparison to approaches relying on reasoning solely within the space of questions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: Active Task Disambiguation with LLMs The paper addresses a significant limitation of large language models (LLMs)—their struggle with ambiguously specified tasks, which is common in real-world scenarios. It introduces a structured definition of task ambiguity and employs Bayesian Experimental Design to frame the disambiguation process. The authors propose that LLM agents can enhance task clarity by generating clarifying questions, effectively narrowing down ambiguous tasks, and reducing the risk of unsatisfactory outputs. Successful generation of these questions demands meta-cognitive reasoning—an area where current LLMs may fall short. The approach of active task disambiguation shifts the reasoning burden from implicit understanding to explicit questioning, eventually leading to better task outcomes. Empirical results suggest that this method is more effective than traditional strategies focused solely on question reasoning, highlighting the sensitivity of the response to question selection. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework:** The paper introduces a formal framework for understanding task ambiguity and disambiguation using Bayesian principles, offering a fresh perspective in the context of LLM utilization. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The comparison between the proposed approach and existing methods strengthens the claim of the approach's effectiveness, providing empirical support for its theoretical bases. 3. **Addressing Real-World Challenges:** By focusing on ambiguities that arise in real-world interactions, the paper taps into an area of increasing importance for practical applications of LLMs. 4. **Shift in Reasoning Paradigm:** The transition from implicit to explicit reasoning indicates a deeper understanding of how LLMs might be enhanced for practical usage, paving the way for future research in this direction. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Meta-Cognitive Limitations:** The acknowledgment that current LLMs may lack the necessary meta-cognitive reasoning poses a challenge; if LLMs cannot perform this required reasoning, the effectiveness of the proposed solutions may be limited. 2. **Scope of Application:** While the focus on disambiguation is relevant, the applicability of these findings to diverse and varied domains may require further exploration, as some areas may present unique challenges that are not addressed within the current framework. 3. **Practical Implementation:** Real-world integration of this approach into existing LLM architectures may be complex and could encounter unforeseen limitations in dynamic environments. **Overall Impact:** The exploration of task disambiguation significantly contributes to improving the usability of LLMs in ambiguous situations, a hurdle that has impeded their deployment in complex real-world applications. If successful, the proposed methodologies could lead to more reliable and efficient human-computer interactions. ### Score: 8 **Rationale:** The paper presents a novel and methodologically sound approach addressing a crucial gap in LLM applications, ensuring its relevance to the field. The empirical results validate the practical implications of the research, while the formalization of task ambiguity offers clarity that could guide future studies. However, concerns regarding LLMs' current capabilities in meta-cognitive reasoning and the challenges of practical implementation diminish some of its applicability. Overall, it represents a significant contribution, warranting a high score of 8 for its novelty and potential impact on advancing LLM research and usage.

- **Authors**: Edward Hong Wang, Cynthia Xin Wen
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated that extended inference through techniques can markedly improve performance, yet these gains come with increased computational costs and the propagation of inherent biases found in natural languages. This paper explores the design of a unified AI-centric language system that addresses these challenges by offering a more concise, unambiguous, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional human languages. We analyze the limitations of natural language such as gender bias, morphological irregularities, and contextual ambiguities and examine how these issues are exacerbated within current Transformer architectures, where redundant attention heads and token inefficiencies prevail. Drawing on insights from emergent artificial communication systems and constructed languages like Esperanto and Lojban, we propose a framework that translates diverse natural language inputs into a streamlined AI-friendly language, enabling more efficient model training and inference while reducing memory footprints. Finally, we outline a pathway for empirical validation through controlled experiments, paving the way for a universal interchange format that could revolutionize AI-to-AI and human-to-AI interactions by enhancing clarity, fairness, and overall performance.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04491v1)
- **Authors**: Ziheng Cheng, Tianyu Xie, Shiyue Zhang, Cheng Zhang
- **Abstract**: While conditional diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in various applications, they require abundant data to train from scratch, which is often infeasible in practice. To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Provable Sample-Efficient Transfer Learning Conditional Diffusion Models via Representation Learning" addresses the challenge of training conditional diffusion models when data is scarce, emphasizing the importance of transfer learning in such scenarios. The authors explore the theoretical foundations of transfer learning in this context, proposing that by leveraging low-dimensional representations of conditions that are shared across tasks, the sample complexity for target tasks can be significantly lowered. Their findings are validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating practical implications in real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a valued contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly within the realms of transfer learning and diffusion models. Here are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, contributing to the score assessment: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty and Originality:** The focus on bridging the theoretical aspects of representation learning with conditional diffusion models is a fresh approach in the literature. By establishing the connection and deriving sample complexity results, the work opens new avenues for further research in transfer learning.     2. **Theoretical Foundation:** The authors provide a rigorous framework to understand how shared representations can enhance the sample efficiency of target tasks. This theoretical underpinning is essential for future work and presents a solid basis for claims made regarding sample complexity reductions. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The inclusion of numerical experiments strengthens the paper, as it links theory with practical outcomes, validating the proposed methodologies in real-world settings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** While the authors have advanced the theoretical understanding, the scope of the analysis might be seen as narrow. For instance, the paper could expand on various types of conditions or tasks that may not align well with the low-dimensional representation assumption. 2. **Generality of Findings:** The results may have specific applicability and might not generalize well across diverse types of conditional diffusion models. The paper could have benefited from discussing the limitations or potential extensions of the proposed approach more explicitly. 3. **Lack of Comparison with Existing Methods:** Although the paper presents empirical results, a more thorough comparison against baseline methods or existing transfer learning frameworks would enhance the reader's understanding of the practical advantages of the proposed methods. Given the paper's contributions in establishing a theoretical basis for a critically important area aligned with current trends in machine learning, I assess the impact and novelty as follows: Score: 7 This score reflects a strong contribution with notable theoretical advancement but recognizes that there remains room for further exploration and broader application of the findings before it can be deemed exceptional within the field.

### Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Focal Diversity Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04492v1)
- **Authors**: Selim Furkan Tekin, Fatih Ilhan, Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Zachary Yahn, Ling Liu
- **Abstract**: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their finetuning strategies has triggered the renewed interests in multi-agent reinforcement learning. In this paper, we introduce a focal diversity-optimized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, coined as MARL-Focal, with three unique characteristics. First, we develop an agent-fusion framework for encouraging multiple LLM based agents to collaborate in producing the final inference output for each LLM query. Second, we develop a focal-diversity optimized agent selection algorithm that can choose a small subset of the available agents based on how well they can complement one another to generate the query output. Finally, we design a conflict-resolution method to detect output inconsistency among multiple agents and produce our MARL-Focal output through reward-aware and policy-adaptive inference fusion. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks show that MARL-Focal is cost-efficient and adversarial-robust. Our multi-agent fusion model achieves performance improvement of 5.51\% compared to the best individual LLM-agent and offers stronger robustness over the TruthfulQA benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/sftekin/rl-focal
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning called MARL-Focal, which leverages the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs). It features an agent-fusion framework for collaboration among LLM-based agents during inference, a focal-diversity optimized algorithm for selecting agent subsets that best complement each other, and a conflict-resolution mechanism to address output inconsistencies. The framework demonstrates significant improvements, with a 5.51% performance gain over the top individual agent, while also enhancing robustness, particularly in adversarial scenarios like those posed by the TruthfulQA benchmark. **Evaluation:** The novelty of MARL-Focal lies in its integration of LLMs within a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, differentiating itself with its three components. The use of agent fusion for collaborative outputs is a compelling idea and addresses a genuine challenge in the field: ensuring that diverse agent outputs can be harmonized effectively. Additionally, the focal-diversity optimization represents an innovative method for agent selection that emphasizes agent complementarity, which has not been extensively explored in prior works. However, while the proposed methods are interesting, the paper does not deeply explore how the proposed algorithms compare with state-of-the-art methods beyond just performance metrics. Furthermore, the paper's impact may be limited by its context of LLMs, which, while currently popular, may not hold similar importance across all domains of reinforcement learning. For the evaluation, extensive experiments are presented, but details regarding the benchmarks and their selection criteria raise concerns about generalizability. Strengths: - Innovative integration of LLMs into collaborative reinforcement learning. - Comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks. - Demonstrates both performance and robustness improvements. Weaknesses: - Limited comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods. - Contextual reliance on LLMs may restrict applicability to broader RL scenarios. - Lack of thorough theoretical grounding for some proposed algorithms. The paper could influence the field significantly if future work expands upon the theoretical underpinnings and broadens the tutorial nature of the MARL-Focal approach to encompass various types of agents beyond LLMs. Given a balanced consideration of the strengths, weaknesses, and overall contributions to the field, I assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid innovation while recognizing that further empirical validation and comparative analysis are necessary for a stronger claim of impact. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Zhaoyang Wang, Jinqi Jiang, Huichi Zhou, Wenhao Zheng, Xuchao Zhang, Chetan Bansal, Huaxiu Yao
- **Abstract**: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated satisfying general instruction following ability. However, small LLMs with about 7B parameters still struggle fine-grained format following (e.g., JSON format), which seriously hinder the advancements of their applications. Most existing methods focus on benchmarking general instruction following while overlook how to improve the specific format following ability for small LLMs. Besides, these methods often rely on evaluations based on advanced LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), which can introduce the intrinsic bias of LLMs and be costly due to the API calls. In this paper, we first curate a fully verifiable format following dataset VFF. In contrast to existing works often adopting external LLMs for instruction-following validations, every sample of VFF can be easily validated with a Python function. Further, we propose to leverage this verifiable feature to synthesize massive data for progressively training small LLMs, in order to improve their format following abilities. Experimental results highlight the prevalent limitations in the format following capabilities of 7B level open-source LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in enhancing this essential ability.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Verifiable Format Control for Large Language Model Generations" addresses the challenges of fine-grained format following in small large language models (LLMs), particularly those with around 7 billion parameters. Although these models show potential in general instruction-following, they struggle significantly with specific formats, such as JSON, affecting their practical applications. The authors present the Verifiable Format Following dataset (VFF), which allows for straightforward validation of format adherence using Python functions, in contrast to prior works that rely on evaluations from advanced LLMs, which may introduce biases and incur high costs. The authors propose utilizing the verifiability of VFF to generate large quantities of training data aimed at improving format adherence in small LLMs. Empirical results underscore the limited format following abilities of currently available small LLMs and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in enhancing these capabilities. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Novel Dataset (VFF):** The creation of the VFF dataset is a significant contribution, as it allows researchers to validate format following in a straightforward manner without depending on larger, costlier models. This approach can democratize research in the field by enabling smaller LLMs to be tested and trained effectively. 2. **Focus on Small Models:** The paper’s emphasis on small LLMs is timely and important, given the growing interest in making AI accessible and efficient at lower computational costs. By addressing this niche, the authors highlight an overlooked aspect of LLM capabilities, which amplifies the paper's relevance. 3. **Methodology:** The proposed method of using the vouchsafed dataset to synthesize training data for small LLMs demonstrates innovation in tackling a practical problem faced in the deployment of language models, enhancing their applicability. **Strengths:** - The dataset's verifiability makes it a valuable resource for the research community. - The experiments conducted provide clear evidence of the limitations of 7B parameter models and the potential for improvement through the proposed method. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could provide more extensive comparisons with existing format following approaches, allowing for a deeper understanding of where it stands in relation to others. - While the initial results are promising, more extensive empirical results across diverse model frameworks and tasks would solidify claims about the method's generalizability. **Potential Influence:** The paper's approach can inspire further research into small language models, especially in developing benchmarks and methodologies that enhance model capabilities for real-world applications. If the techniques outlined here gain traction, they can lead to significant advancements in natural language processing tasks that require strict format adherence. Overall, the combination of a novel dataset, a clear gap identification in LLM capabilities, and a promising methodology leads to the conclusion that this paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field. **Score: 8**

### ULPT: Prompt Tuning with Ultra-Low-Dimensional Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04501v1)
- **Authors**: Zijun Wu, Yongchang Hao, Lili Mou
- **Abstract**: Large language models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are costly to fine-tune due to their size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as prompt tuning, address this by reducing trainable parameters while maintaining strong performance. However, prior methods tie prompt embeddings to the model's dimensionality, which may not scale well with larger LLMs and more customized LLMs. In this paper, we propose Ultra-Low-dimensional Prompt Tuning (ULPT), which optimizes prompts in a low-dimensional space (e.g., 2D) and use a random but frozen matrix for the up-projection. To enhance alignment, we introduce learnable shift and scale embeddings. ULPT drastically reduces the trainable parameters, e.g., 2D only using 2% parameters compared with vanilla prompt tuning while retaining most of the performance across 21 NLP tasks. Our theoretical analysis shows that random projections can capture high-rank structures effectively, and experimental results demonstrate ULPT's competitive performance over existing parameter-efficient methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "ULPT: Prompt Tuning with Ultra-Low-Dimensional Optimization" introduces a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters while maintaining performance. The authors propose Ultra-Low-dimensional Prompt Tuning (ULPT), which operates in a low-dimensional space (e.g., 2D) and employs a fixed random matrix for up-projection. They further enhance the method through the introduction of learnable embeddings for shifting and scaling the prompts. The results demonstrate that ULPT drastically cuts down the number of trainable parameters—using only 2% compared to traditional prompt tuning—while performing competitively across 21 different NLP tasks. The theoretical framework provided supports the efficacy of random projections in capturing high-dimensional traits, and experimental findings validate ULPT’s advantages over existing parameter-efficient tuning methods. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation In evaluating the novelty and significance of this paper, several aspects come to the forefront: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Dimensionality Reduction**: The core idea of optimizing prompts within an ultra-low-dimensional space is a notable departure from traditional methods that directly correlate prompt embeddings to model size. This inventive approach could have implications for future research in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.     2. **Performance Retention**: Demonstrating that ULPT can maintain competitive performance across a range of NLP tasks despite drastically decreasing trainable parameters is a significant achievement, addressing a key challenge in the field regarding model efficiency. 3. **Scalability**: The method's inherent scalability potential makes it applicable for larger and more customized LLMs, potentially influencing how practitioners consider model adaptation in diverse applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Justification**: While the theoretical claims about random projections capturing high-dimensional structures are intriguing, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the mathematical principles involved and the practical implications when applied to different types of datasets or tasks. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the paper asserts competitive performance against existing methods, the absence of a comprehensive analysis comparing ULPT with other state-of-the-art approaches within varied contexts raises questions about its robustness and generalizability across different model architectures. 3. **Broader Impact**: While the method is innovative, the extent to which it alters the landscape of fine-tuning existing transformers is still unclear. It remains to be seen how this approach will be received in the wider NLP community, particularly in terms of ease of adoption and adaptability to varied tasks. Overall, while the proposal of ULPT represents a meaningful advancement in the landscape of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, the paper leaves some aspects unaddressed that could enhance its contributions.  **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and competitive results while acknowledging the need for further theoretical depth and broader comparative analysis, which would bolster its impact on the field of NLP.

### Fast Video Generation with Sliding Tile Attention
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04507v1)
- **Authors**: Peiyuan Zhang, Yongqi Chen, Runlong Su, Hangliang Ding, Ion Stoica, Zhenghong Liu, Hao Zhang
- **Abstract**: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention power state-of-the-art video generation, but suffer from prohibitive compute cost -- when generating just a 5-second 720P video, attention alone takes 800 out of 945 seconds of total inference time. This paper introduces sliding tile attention (STA) to address this challenge. STA leverages the observation that attention scores in pretrained video diffusion models predominantly concentrate within localized 3D windows. By sliding and attending over the local spatial-temporal region, STA eliminates redundancy from full attention. Unlike traditional token-wise sliding window attention (SWA), STA operates tile-by-tile with a novel hardware-aware sliding window design, preserving expressiveness while being hardware-efficient. With careful kernel-level optimizations, STA offers the first efficient 2D/3D sliding-window-like attention implementation, achieving 58.79% MFU. Precisely, STA accelerates attention by 2.8-17x over FlashAttention-2 (FA2) and 1.6-10x over FlashAttention-3 (FA3). On the leading video DiT, HunyuanVideo, STA reduces end-to-end latency from 945s (FA3) to 685s without quality degradation, requiring no training. Enabling finetuning further lowers latency to 268s with only a 0.09% drop on VBench.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by introducing a mechanism called sliding tile attention (STA) to improve computational efficiency. Typically, DiTs require extensive compute resources due to their 3D full attention mechanism, consuming 800 seconds of a total 945 seconds for generating a short video. STA optimizes this process by recognizing that attention scores concentrate mainly within localized regions and using a tile-wise approach for attention. This allows for significant reduction in redundancy compared to traditional sliding window attention. The implementation achieves notable speed-ups, as STA accelerates attention computation by factors of 2.8-17x over existing methods, reducing end-to-end video generation latency from 945 seconds to 685 seconds without sacrificing quality. With finetuning, latency is further improved to 268 seconds with only a minimal degradation in performance. **Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates significant novelty and relevance within the computer vision and video generation fields. The introduction of sliding tile attention not only addresses a critical bottleneck in the application of DiTs but also suggests an innovative way to conduct localized attention efficiently. The concentration of attention scores in localized windows is an insightful observation that can influence future research directions, particularly in balancing performance with computational demands. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Contribution:** STA provides a fresh approach to handling attention in video generation, presenting both theoretical and practical improvements over existing methods. 2. **Implementation Efficiency:** The hardware-aware sliding window design shows a strong understanding of practical limitations in inference, making the method applicable in real-world scenarios. 3. **Performance Metrics:** The reported acceleration factors and latency reductions provide compelling evidence of STA's effectiveness, indicating that it can extend the viability of video Diffusion Transformers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** The method’s robustness and performance across various datasets or video types may be limited, as the paper primarily focuses on specific conditions. 2. **Lack of Comparisons:** While the paper claims substantial improvements, a deeper comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art techniques, particularly those outside FlashAttention, could strengthen the findings. Overall, the paper showcases a commendable advancement in video generation technologies and addresses a pressing issue with computational efficiency. Its findings are likely to spur further exploration into efficient attention mechanisms in various contexts beyond video generation. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, balancing innovation with practical applicability, while also noting areas where further research could expand on the findings.

### Generative Autoregressive Transformers for Model-Agnostic Federated MRI Reconstruction

- **Authors**: Valiyeh A. Nezhad, Gokberk Elmas, Bilal Kabas, Fuat Arslan, Tolga Çukur
- **Abstract**: Although learning-based models hold great promise for MRI reconstruction, single-site models built on limited local datasets often suffer from poor generalization. This challenge has spurred interest in collaborative model training on multi-site datasets via federated learning (FL) -- a privacy-preserving framework that aggregates model updates instead of sharing imaging data. Conventional FL builds a global model by aggregating locally trained model weights, inherently constraining all sites to a homogeneous model architecture. This rigid homogeneity requirement forces sites to forgo architectures tailored to their compute infrastructure and application-specific demands. Consequently, existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction fail to support model-heterogeneous settings, where individual sites are allowed to use distinct architectures. To overcome this fundamental limitation, here we introduce FedGAT, a novel model-agnostic FL technique based on generative autoregressive transformers. FedGAT decentralizes the training of a global generative prior that captures the distribution of multi-site MR images. For enhanced fidelity, we propose a novel site-prompted GAT prior that controllably synthesizes MR images from desired sites via autoregressive prediction across spatial scales. Each site then trains its site-specific reconstruction model -- using its preferred architecture -- on a hybrid dataset comprising the local MRI dataset and GAT-generated synthetic MRI datasets for other sites. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional datasets demonstrate that FedGAT supports flexible collaborations while enjoying superior within-site and across-site reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art FL baselines.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents FedGAT, an innovative model-agnostic federated learning framework designed specifically for MRI reconstruction challenges. Traditional federated learning strategies require participating sites to adopt a uniform model architecture, which limits flexibility and adaptability to local computational infrastructures. This paper addresses that issue by proposing a generative autoregressive transformer-based approach that enables sites to use diverse architectures while collaborating on a shared generative prior model. FedGAT allows each site to enhance its locally trained reconstruction model with a hybrid dataset that combines local data and synthetic MR images generated by a site-prompted generative model. The authors demonstrate that this decentralized, flexible collaboration improves reconstruction performance both within and across sites compared to existing federated learning methods. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing Limitations**: The paper effectively tackles a significant challenge in federated learning for medical imaging, specifically the issue of architectural homogeneity that can stifle flexibility. This is a critical advancement, as it opens opportunities for enhanced collaboration between institutions with varying computational capabilities or research focuses.     2. **Generative Approach**: The introduction of generative autoregressive transformers in the federated learning context is novel and potentially impactful. It allows for the synthesis of high-fidelity MRI images that can augment training datasets, which could lead to improved model robustness and generalization. 3. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The paper includes thorough experiments on multi-institutional datasets, clearly demonstrating the advantages of FedGAT. This empirical support increases the credibility of their claims and validates the proposed framework. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Computational Demand**: While the novelty of allowing heterogeneous models is a strong point, implementing such a structure may introduce significant complexity in coordination and computational overhead, which could hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. 2. **Generality of Results**: The results are promising, but without comparisons to a wider array of federated learning methods and datasets beyond the ones tested, it is challenging to ascertain the overall generalizability of FedGAT's performance claims. 3. **Implementation Details**: The technical specifics of implementing FedGAT might present challenges for practitioners aiming to replicate or build upon this work. More detailed guidance or resources could enhance the accessibility of the proposed method. ### Overall Assessment Given the innovative approach to federated learning that accommodates architectural diversity and the potential for improved MRI reconstruction outcomes, FedGAT presents a significant advancement in the field. Its novelty lies in providing a flexible framework that may lead to better model performance in medical imaging contexts where data privacy and model specialization are of utmost concern. However, the implementation complexity and the need for wider comparative studies suggest that while the contribution is notable, it may require additional refinement before achieving widespread applicability. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04528v1)
- **Authors**: Minseok Jung, Cynthia Fuertes Panizo, Liam Dugan, May Fung, Pin-Yu Chen, Paul Pu Liang
- **Abstract**: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has made it difficult to differentiate human-written text from AI-generated text. Several AI-text detectors have been developed in response, which typically utilize a fixed global threshold (e.g., {\theta} = 0.5) to classify machine-generated text. However, we find that one universal threshold can fail to account for subgroup-specific distributional variations. For example, when using a fixed threshold, detectors make more false positive errors on shorter human-written text than longer, and more positive classifications on neurotic writing styles than open among long text. These discrepancies can lead to misclassification that disproportionately affects certain groups. We address this critical limitation by introducing FairOPT, an algorithm for group-specific threshold optimization in AI-generated content classifiers. Our approach partitions data into subgroups based on attributes (e.g., text length and writing style) and learns decision thresholds for each group, which enables careful balancing of performance and fairness metrics within each subgroup. In experiments with four AI text classifiers on three datasets, FairOPT enhances overall F1 score and decreases balanced error rate (BER) discrepancy across subgroups. Our framework paves the way for more robust and fair classification criteria in AI-generated output detection.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "Group-Adaptive Threshold Optimization for Robust AI-Generated Text Detection" addresses the challenges posed by large language models (LLMs) in distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated texts. Traditionally, AI text detectors rely on a fixed global threshold, which has been shown to be inadequate due to the varying distributional characteristics of different subgroups. For example, fixed thresholds produce a higher rate of false positives for shorter human texts and misclassifications based on writing styles. The authors propose “FairOPT,” an innovative algorithm that optimizes detection thresholds for identified subgroups, considering attributes such as text length and writing style. By this means, FairOPT aims to enhance classification accuracy and fairness across various groups. Experimental results indicate that FairOPT outperforms traditional approaches, yielding improvements in F1 scores and reducing discrepancies in balanced error rates (BER) across subgroups. The approach highlights the importance of tailored metrics for a fairer AI-generated text detection process. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Contribution to Methodology:** The paper introduces a unique approach by focusing on subgroup-specific adaptations of detection thresholds, which has not been widely explored in the domain of AI text classification. This represents a step forward in the field, emphasizing fairness alongside accuracy in AI detection mechanisms.     2. **Addressing an Urgent Need:** With the rise of sophisticated LLMs, the potential for bias in AI-generated text detection has implications for societal equity—this is a pressing issue as AI continues to permeate various aspects of content creation and consumption. The proposed method directly addresses this need, making it significant for both academic research and practical applications. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental validation of the FairOPT algorithm across multiple datasets and classifiers adds robustness to the claims made in the paper. The reported improvements in F1 score and BER indicate a meaningful contribution to the performance of AI text detection systems. **Strengths:** - The algorithm’s consideration of subgroup characteristics is a notable advancement in the pursuit of fairness in AI outputs. - The methodology offers a framework that can potentially be adapted to various other classification tasks beyond AI text detection, demonstrating versatility. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of limitations inherent to subgroup analyses, including the potential overfitting to subgroup-specific data and how its performance scales across more diverse datasets. - The results, while promising, may require further validation through real-world applications to ascertain their practical effectiveness and generalizability outside controlled evaluation settings. **Potential Influence:** The introduction of FairOPT has the potential to influence future research in AI ethics, algorithm fairness, and the development of detection systems that aim to mitigate biases inherent in AI processes. It encourages researchers and practitioners to reconsider one-size-fits-all solutions in machine learning applications. ### Score: 8 **Rationale for the Score:** This score reflects an acknowledgment of the paper's innovative approach and its practical significance in addressing the fairness of AI-generated text detection systems. While the contributions are significant and the empirical results promising, future work is needed to further establish the generalizability and robustness of the approach across diverse real-world scenarios. Thus, it stands out as a solid contribution while leaving room for future exploration and optimization.

- **Authors**: Chenyang Huang, Hao Zhou, Cameron Jen, Kangjie Zheng, Osmar R. Zaïane, Lili Mou
- **Abstract**: Length-control summarization aims to condense long texts into a short one within a certain length limit. Previous approaches often use autoregressive (AR) models and treat the length requirement as a soft constraint, which may not always be satisfied. In this study, we propose a novel length-control decoding algorithm based on the Directed Acyclic Transformer (DAT). Our approach allows for multiple plausible sequence fragments and predicts a \emph{path} to connect them. In addition, we propose a Sequence Maximum a Posteriori (SeqMAP) decoding algorithm that marginalizes different possible paths and finds the most probable summary satisfying the length budget. Our algorithm is based on beam search, which further facilitates a reranker for performance improvement. Experimental results on the Gigaword and DUC2004 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance for length-control summarization.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to length-control summarization, addressing the limitations of existing autoregressive models that only loosely adhere to specified length constraints. The authors introduce a decoding algorithm utilizing Directed Acyclic Transformers (DAT) which generates multiple plausible sequence fragments and links them via a predictive path. Additionally, they introduce the Sequence Maximum a Posteriori (SeqMAP) decoding method to optimize the summary by considering different potential paths and selecting the most probable one that fits within a specified length limit. The algorithm is designed to enhance summarization performance through a beam search mechanism, which also includes a reranker. Empirical results from experiments conducted on the Gigaword and DUC2004 datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in length-controlled summarization tasks. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper makes a significant contribution by introducing a method specifically tailored for length-control summarization that moves beyond the traditional autoregressive framework. The Directed Acyclic Transformer architecture is innovative in that it facilitates a structure where multiple sequence fragments can be combined optimally, which is a significant conceptual advancement over existing models. The introduction of SeqMAP for marginalizing paths adds another layer of novelty, addressing depth in the predictive capabilities while adhering to length constraints. **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Innovation**: The integration of DAT and SeqMAP showcases a technically sophisticated approach to summarization that is relatively unexplored. 2. **Performance Improvements**: The empirical results demonstrate marked improvements over prior techniques, which supports the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. 3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-organized and articulates its methodologies and results clearly, making it accessible to readers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization**: While the results on the Gigaword and DUC2004 datasets are promising, the generalizability of these findings to other datasets or text types isn't thoroughly discussed. It would be beneficial for the authors to validate their method in more real-world scenarios or varied text genres. 2. **Scalability Concerns**: The complexity involved in the beam search and reranking could raise concerns about the scalability and computational efficiency of the proposed approach compared to simpler methods. 3. **Limited Comparison Against State-of-the-Art**: Although the authors present strong empirical results, a more extensive comparison against the latest state-of-the-art techniques could bolster the argument for their approach's effectiveness. **Impact on the Field:** This paper's advancements in length-control summarization hold potential for influencing further research in summarization technologies, particularly in contexts where text brevity is critical. The methodologies could pave the way for new applications in various fields such as news summarization, document clustering, and user content generation.  **Score: 8** Rationale: The paper presents a solid methodological innovation with promising empirical results, marking a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing and summarization. However, concerns about generalizability and efficiency slightly detract from its overall impact, preventing it from being rated a perfect score. The innovations are substantial, and the results promising enough to place this work among the noteworthy contributions in recent literature on text summarization.

- **Authors**: Chenyang Huang, Fei Huang, Zaixiang Zheng, Osmar R. Zaïane, Hao Zhou, Lili Mou
- **Abstract**: Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) aims at using one single model for multiple translation directions. Recent work applies non-autoregressive Transformers to improve the efficiency of MNMT, but requires expensive knowledge distillation (KD) processes. To this end, we propose an M-DAT approach to non-autoregressive multilingual machine translation. Our system leverages the recent advance of the directed acyclic Transformer (DAT), which does not require KD. We further propose a pivot back-translation (PivotBT) approach to improve the generalization to unseen translation directions. Experiments show that our M-DAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive MNMT.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Multilingual Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation without Knowledge Distillation" addresses the challenge of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) by presenting a novel non-autoregressive approach, termed M-DAT. Unlike previous methodologies that rely on extensive knowledge distillation (KD) processes, M-DAT utilizes the directed acyclic Transformer (DAT) architecture, which operates without KD. Additionally, the authors introduce a technique called pivot back-translation (PivotBT) to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen translation directions. Experimental results indicate that M-DAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive MNMT tasks, suggesting promising advancements over existing frameworks. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper presents a significant advancement in multilingual translation by eliminating the reliance on knowledge distillation, a common bottleneck in non-autoregressive machine translation systems. The integration of the DAT architecture and the innovative PivotBT technique is a fresh perspective that contributes to both the efficiency and effectiveness of MNMT. The introduction of a model that directly competes with established methodologies while being less resource-intensive marks a notable innovation. **Significance**: The significance of this work lies in its potential to make multilingual translation systems more accessible and less computationally demanding. By streamlining the translation process, this approach stands to benefit both researchers and applications in real-world settings, particularly where computational resources are limited. **Strengths**: - **Resource Efficiency**: The elimination of KD simplifies the training process and reduces resource consumption, making the technology more viable for diverse usage scenarios. - **State-of-the-Art Results**: Empirical results that showcase superior performance bolster the credibility and relevance of the proposed model. - **Generalization Capability**: The PivotBT method demonstrates a thoughtful approach to enhancing model flexibility in handling new translation pairs, an essential factor in practical deployments. **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Scope of Experiments**: While the results are compelling, the experiments may benefit from a broader range of language pairs and contexts to evaluate the model's robustness across diverse scenarios. - **Potential for Overfitting**: As with any complex model, there is a risk of overfitting, particularly with unseen translation directions. Further analysis on this front would add depth to the findings. **Influence on the Field**: The paper is likely to influence ongoing research in MNMT by encouraging further exploration of non-autoregressive architectures and the abandonment of knowledge distillation where feasible. It offers a new direction for future studies and applications in machine translation technology. In conclusion, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of multilingual translation, primarily by addressing existing limitations regarding efficiency and resource intensiveness. It sets a precedent for future work while also revealing possible avenues for further inquiry. **Score: 8**

### Mechanisms of Projective Composition of Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04549v1)
- **Authors**: Arwen Bradley, Preetum Nakkiran, David Berthelot, James Thornton, Joshua M. Susskind
- **Abstract**: We study the theoretical foundations of composition in diffusion models, with a particular focus on out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Prior work has shown that composing distributions via linear score combination can achieve promising results, including length-generalization in some cases (Du et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022). However, our theoretical understanding of how and why such compositions work remains incomplete. In fact, it is not even entirely clear what it means for composition to "work". This paper starts to address these fundamental gaps. We begin by precisely defining one possible desired result of composition, which we call projective composition. Then, we investigate: (1) when linear score combinations provably achieve projective composition, (2) whether reverse-diffusion sampling can generate the desired composition, and (3) the conditions under which composition fails. Finally, we connect our theoretical analysis to prior empirical observations where composition has either worked or failed, for reasons that were unclear at the time.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Mechanisms of Projective Composition of Diffusion Models" delves into the theoretical underpinnings of how composition operates in diffusion models, concentrating on issues like out-of-distribution extrapolation and length-generalization. Existing literature indicates that linear combinations of scores can lead to effective compositions, particularly for length-generalization. However, the authors argue that a clear theoretical understanding of these compositions is still lacking. They introduce the concept of "projective composition" as a framework to assess the efficacy of score combinations. The study aims to clarify three primary aspects: the conditions under which linear score combinations achieve projective composition, the effectiveness of reverse-diffusion sampling in creating desired compositions, and the circumstances that lead to failures in composition. The authors conclude by linking their findings back to empirical studies that have documented instances of both successful and unsuccessful compositions. ### Critical Evaluation The paper provides a meaningful contribution to the understanding of diffusion models, particularly in the context of composition and generalization. It tackles fundamental theoretical gaps that have persisted in the literature, especially concerning the unclear nature of composition effectiveness. By defining projective composition, the authors lay a groundwork for more structured future research. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Framework:** The introduction of projective composition serves as a pivotal insight into evaluating the quality of compositions, moving the conversation forward in a significant way. 2. **Clarity in Analysis:** The paper's approach to dissect when and how compositions work, as well as when they fail, addresses crucial aspects that have been inadequately explored in prior research. 3. **Connection to Empirical Observations:** By linking theoretical insights back to empirical data, the authors provide practical relevance to their findings, aiding future investigations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the paper defines and scrutinizes projective composition, it may still be too narrow in focusing only on linear combinations, potentially overlooking richer non-linear composition methods. 2. **Generalizability:** The results may be context-specific, limiting their applicability across different models or tasks beyond the studied diffusion frameworks. 3. **Complexity and Accessibility:** The rigorous theoretical treatment might present challenges for practitioners or newcomers in the field to readily apply the findings in practical scenarios. Given these factors, this paper advances the field by providing much-needed clarity and a structured approach to understanding composition in diffusion models. However, the limitations in scope and the potential barrier to application slightly diminish its impact. ### Score Score: 8 This score reflects a well-reasoned position acknowledging the paper’s significant theoretical contributions while also considering its limitations in scope and accessibility. The work can influence future research directions by providing essential insights for further exploration and application of composition in diffusion models.

### TruthFlow: Truthful LLM Generation via Representation Flow Correction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04556v1)
- **Authors**: Hanyu Wang, Bochuan Cao, Yuanpu Cao, Jinghui Chen
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are known to struggle with consistently generating truthful responses. While various representation intervention techniques have been proposed, these methods typically apply a universal representation correction vector to all input queries, limiting their effectiveness against diverse queries in practice. In this study, we introduce TruthFlow, a novel method that leverages the Flow Matching technique for query-specific truthful representation correction. Specifically, TruthFlow first uses a flow model to learn query-specific correction vectors that transition representations from hallucinated to truthful states. Then, during inference, the trained flow model generates these correction vectors to enhance the truthfulness of LLM outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that TruthFlow significantly improves performance on open-ended generation tasks across various advanced LLMs evaluated on TruthfulQA. Moreover, the trained TruthFlow model exhibits strong transferability, performing effectively on other unseen hallucination benchmarks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "TruthFlow: Truthful LLM Generation via Representation Flow Correction" addresses a significant challenge in the use of large language models (LLMs)—their tendency to generate untruthful or hallucinatory responses. Existing methods for enhancing truthfulness often utilize a single universal representation correction vector, which restricts their effectiveness across varying query types. In contrast, TruthFlow proposes a novel approach that employs a Flow Matching technique to create specific correction vectors tailored to individual queries. This method enables the transformation of model representations from untruthful to truthful states by training a flow model that learns these query-specific corrections. During inference, the trained model applies these vectors, significantly boosting the accuracy of truthful outputs. Experimental results showcase improvements in open-ended generation tasks on the TruthfulQA benchmark, and the approach demonstrates strong transferability to other unseen hallucination tests. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** TruthFlow introduces a distinctive method by focusing on query-specific representation corrections rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. This adaptability is a notable improvement over existing techniques. Furthermore, the integration of flow models for correcting representations in LLMs adds a fresh perspective to the ongoing discourse around LLM truthfulness. **Significance:** The paper tackles an essential and pertinent issue within the AI and NLP communities—the reliability and correctness of LLM outputs. Given the rising reliance on these models in various applications, ensuring their truthfulness has far-reaching implications. The experimental validation, showing enhanced performance on specific benchmarks, underlines the potential of the proposed method to inform real-world applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: Introducing query-specific corrections adds depth and specificity to truthfulness enhancement techniques. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The use of established benchmarks like TruthfulQA and other unseen tests for evaluation strengthens the claims made in the paper. 3. **Transferability**: Demonstrating the model's effectiveness beyond the original dataset implies a versatility that could benefit various use cases. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the conceptual framework is sound, the practical implications and deployment of the flow model might present challenges in real-world scenarios, particularly in computational efficiency and adaptability to new domains. 2. **Lack of Comprehensive Evaluation**: While improvements are reported, a more extensive evaluation across a wider range of scenarios would help ascertain the robustness of TruthFlow under diverse conditions and types of queries. **Conclusion:** The contributions of the paper are noteworthy, with both theoretical advancement and practical testing supporting its claims. However, further empirical work and application to a broader set of tasks would provide clearer insight into the model's generalizability and robustness. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, recognizing the innovative aspects of the proposed method and the practical implications of enhancing LLM truthfulness. However, the challenges related to implementation and the necessity for more extensive evaluations temper the score slightly below the highest level.

### Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Approximate Verification
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04557v1)
- **Authors**: Meiyu Zhong, Noel Teku, Ravi Tandon
- **Abstract**: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing approximate sequential verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This leads to reducing the number of calls to the larger LLM and can achieve further speedups. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency. For instance, on Wiki-Summaries dataset, SPRINTER achieves a 1.7x latency speedup and requires 8.3x fewer flops relative to SD, while still generating high-quality responses when using GPT2-Small and GPT2-XL as draft/target models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SPRINTER, a novel approach to enhancing the Speculative Decoding (SD) technique used for faster inference in Large Language Models (LLMs). SD primarily relies on a smaller draft LLM for generating tokens and a larger target LLM for verifying statistical consistency. However, frequent verification calls to the target LLM hinder latency improvements. SPRINTER addresses this by employing a low-complexity verifier that predicts acceptability of generated tokens without requiring verification from the target LLM unless necessary. This method enables approximate sequential verification, leading to a substantial reduction in the number of calls to the larger LLM, thus achieving notable latency speedups. The paper includes theoretical analyses regarding token generation properties and provides empirical results showing that SPRINTER can maintain high-quality outputs while significantly enhancing performance metrics, such as achieving a 1.7x latency speedup and requiring 8.3x fewer flops on the Wiki-Summaries dataset compared to traditional SD. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a meaningful enhancement to existing speculative decoding techniques. The novelty lies in the introduction of the low-complexity verifier, which allows for an avoidance of expensive calls to the larger LLM unless tokens generated by the draft LLM are predicted to be problematic. This approach contributes to the efficiency of LLM applications in real-time scenarios, where latency is critical. **Strengths:** 1. **Reduction in Latency**: The proposed solution demonstrates significant reductions in latency and computational resources, which is crucial for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments. 2. **Maintaining Quality**: Despite the speedup, the method maintains high-quality generation, indicating a successful balance between efficiency and effectiveness. 3. **Theoretical and Empirical Validation**: The combination of theoretical analysis and empirical results adds rigor to the evaluation of the proposed method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Verification**: While the low-complexity verifier simplifies the process, the choice of what constitutes "acceptable" tokens may introduce a level of complexity that could limit the scalability across a diverse set of tasks. 2. **Dependence on Model Pair**: The experiments focus on specific model pairs (GPT2-Small and GPT2-XL), which may limit generalizability. It is unclear how well the method would perform across other model architectures or larger LLMs. 3. **Generalization to Other Tasks**: The performance on a limited dataset and scenario might not reflect efficacy in broader applications of LLMs in diverse contexts (such as conversational agents or complex reasoning tasks) where verifying correctness is more nuanced. **Conclusion:** Given the strengths regarding innovation in speed and resource efficiency and maintaining output quality, alongside some limitations regarding generalizability and the specific model dependence, this paper represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of LLM inference. The potential influence of this work on improving the real-time application of LLMs highlights its significance. Score: 8

- **Authors**: Sandra C. Sandoval, Christabel Acquaye, Kwesi Cobbina, Mohammad Nayeem Teli, Hal Daumé III
- **Abstract**: We examine the representation of African American English (AAE) in large language models (LLMs), exploring (a) the perceptions Black Americans have of how effective these technologies are at producing authentic AAE, and (b) in what contexts Black Americans find this desirable. Through both a survey of Black Americans ($n=$ 104) and annotation of LLM-produced AAE by Black Americans ($n=$ 228), we find that Black Americans favor choice and autonomy in determining when AAE is appropriate in LLM output. They tend to prefer that LLMs default to communicating in Mainstream U.S. English in formal settings, with greater interest in AAE production in less formal settings. When LLMs were appropriately prompted and provided in context examples, our participants found their outputs to have a level of AAE authenticity on par with transcripts of Black American speech. Select code and data for our project can be found here: https://github.com/smelliecat/AAEMime.git
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "My LLM might Mimic AAE -- But When Should it?" investigates the representation of African American English (AAE) in large language models (LLMs). It analyzes the perceptions of Black Americans regarding the authenticity of AAE produced by these models and identifies contexts in which AAE is considered desirable. Through a survey involving 104 Black Americans and annotations by 228 participants, the study reveals a preference for LLMs to default to Mainstream U.S. English in formal contexts while being more open to AAE in informal situations. The findings also indicate that when LLMs are given appropriate prompts and contextual examples, the participants perceive the generated AAE to be as authentic as real Black American speech. The study highlights Black Americans’ desire for agency in determining the use of AAE in LLM outputs. **Evaluation:** The paper presents an important contribution to the intersection of linguistics, artificial intelligence, and social equity. Its novelty arises from both the focus on African American English—a variety often marginalized in LLM training—and the methodological approach that centers the voices and preferences of Black Americans. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The examination of AAE within LLMs directly addresses ongoing discussions about representation and inclusivity in technology. 2. **Participant Involvement:** By employing direct feedback from Black Americans, the study enhances community engagement and participatory research, which are often lacking in similar studies. 3. **Clear Findings:** The results provide actionable insights into how LLMs can be fine-tuned to reflect the linguistic preferences of users, facilitating better communication. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Sample Size:** Although the numbers of respondents are reasonable for qualitative research, they may not fully capture the diversity of opinions across the broader Black American community. 2. **Context Awareness:** The paper primarily focuses on preferences without delving deeply into scenarios where misuse of AAE could have negative repercussions, particularly in formal contexts. 3. **Scope for Further Inquiry:** While the findings are significant, the exploration could benefit from longitudinal studies examining how these preferences may evolve as AAE continues to be represented in AI technologies. **Significance in the Field:** This paper contributes to the burgeoning discourse on the ethics of AI language production, particularly concerning underrepresented dialects. It underscores the necessity for AI developers to consider linguistic diversity in model training and application, acting as a catalyst for future research in this domain. Given its strengths in addressing significant social issues through informed methodology, while acknowledging inherent limitations in scope and sample diversity, I assign the paper a score of 8. This score reflects its solid contribution to the field while recognizing the need for further research to expand the understanding of AAE representation in AI. **Score: 8**

### Position-aware Automatic Circuit Discovery
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04577v1)
- **Authors**: Tal Haklay, Hadas Orgad, David Bau, Aaron Mueller, Yonatan Belinkov
- **Abstract**: A widely used strategy to discover and understand language model mechanisms is circuit analysis. A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model's computation graph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit discovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model components as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across positions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics across examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with variable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline for schema generation and application using large language models. Our approach enables fully automated discovery of position-sensitive circuits, yielding better trade-offs between circuit size and faithfulness compared to prior work.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Position-aware Automatic Circuit Discovery" addresses a significant limitation in current circuit discovery methodologies used for analyzing the mechanisms of language models. Traditionally, these methodologies have assumed that model components behave uniformly across different input positions, which has hindered the uncovering of interactions that are context-sensitive or vary based on the position of tokens in the input. To remedy this issue, the authors propose two key advancements:  1. They modify edge attribution patching, a gradient-based technique, to account for token positions in the computational graph. 2. They introduce a novel dataset schema that categorizes token spans with similar semantics across variable-length examples, facilitating the discovery of circuits that acknowledge positionality. Additionally, they present an automated pipeline for generating and applying this schema using large language models. The overall result is a method that supports the automatic discovery of circuits which are more sensitive to position, improving the balance between the size of the circuits and their accuracy compared to previous approaches. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy advance in the field of circuit analysis for language models by directly addressing the constraints of position-invariance in previous methodologies. The effort to incorporate positionality offers a fresh perspective, as understanding cross-positional interactions can significantly enhance our comprehension of model behaviors in realistic scenarios. The dual approach of the edge attribution modification and the introduction of the dataset schema demonstrates methodological rigor and practical applicability, challenging existing paradigms in the field. However, while the proposed methods show promise, certain areas could benefit from further exploration. The paper would be stronger with empirical validation demonstrating the tangible improvements in circuit discovery outcomes over traditional approaches. Additionally, a more in-depth discussion on the implications of implementing position-aware circuits in real-world applications could enhance its significance.  The automated pipeline's reliance on large language models may also raise questions about its accessibility, as practitioners without resources for such models could face barriers to utilizing this approach. Taking these factors into account, the paper presents substantial advancements but also has limitations in empirical support and broader applicability considerations. Therefore, I assign it a score of **Score: 8**. This reflects its significant contribution to the field while acknowledging the need for further substantiation and practical adaptation.

### Technical Debt in In-Context Learning: Diminishing Efficiency in Long Context
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04580v1)
- **Authors**: Taejong Joo, Diego Klabjan
- **Abstract**: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, adapting to new tasks by simply conditioning on demonstrations without parameter updates. Compelling empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that ICL, as a general-purpose learner, could outperform task-specific models. However, it remains unclear to what extent the transformers optimally learn in-context compared to principled learning algorithms. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new framework for quantifying optimality of ICL as a learning algorithm in stylized settings. Our findings reveal a striking dichotomy: while ICL initially matches the efficiency of a Bayes optimal estimator, its efficiency significantly deteriorates in long context. Through an information-theoretic analysis, we show that the diminishing efficiency is inherent to ICL. These results clarify the trade-offs in adopting ICL as a universal problem solver, motivating a new generation of on-the-fly adaptive methods without the diminishing efficiency.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Technical Debt in In-Context Learning: Diminishing Efficiency in Long Context" investigates the efficiency of in-context learning (ICL) in transformers, which leverage contextual cues to learn tasks without updating model parameters. While ICL has shown promising results, the authors seek to determine its optimality compared to well-established learning algorithms. They propose a framework to quantify ICL's effectiveness and conclude that while ICL performs comparably to Bayes optimal estimators initially, its efficiency deteriorates significantly with longer contexts. This inefficiency is demonstrated through an information-theoretic analysis, highlighting inherent limitations in ICL that advocate for the development of more adaptive learning methods. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** This paper brings an important perspective to the ongoing discussions surrounding the efficacy and limitations of in-context learning. The introduction of a quantification framework and information-theoretic analysis lends a novel analytical approach to understanding ICL's efficiency. While prior work has highlighted certain aspects of ICL, the focus on its diminishing efficiency with longer contexts is an underexplored area that contributes to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs involved in using ICL as a universal learner. **Significance:** The implications of this research are significant for the field of machine learning and natural language processing. As transformers become increasingly prevalent, understanding their limitations is crucial for advancing research and applications. The findings call into question the assumption that ICL can act as a one-size-fits-all solution to learning tasks, thereby prompting researchers to consider alternative methodologies, including adaptive approaches that mitigate the efficiency loss identified. **Strengths:** 1. **Rigorous Analysis:** The combination of empirical and theoretical insights enhances the credibility of the findings. 2. **Clear Framework:** The proposed framework for assessing ICL’s optimality could aid future research in evaluating other learning algorithms in similar contexts. 3. **Relevance:** Addresses a timely topic in the field as ICL gains traction in practical applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Specificity of Findings:** The study focuses on stylized settings, which may limit the generalizability of the conclusions to more complex, real-world scenarios. 2. **Limited Exploration of Solutions:** While advocating for new adaptive methods, the paper does not provide concrete alternatives or methodologies for dealing with the identified inefficiency, which may pose a barrier for practitioners seeking immediate applications. Given these considerations, the paper demonstrates both novelty and significance, though it has limitations in its current form. It effectively raises awareness about the challenges associated with ICL and encourages future research on adaptive strategies.  **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Runjin Chen, Gabriel Jacob Perin, Xuxi Chen, Xilun Chen, Yan Han, Nina S. T. Hirata, Junyuan Hong, Bhavya Kailkhura
- **Abstract**: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences, often achieved through fine-tuning based on human feedback, is essential for ensuring safe and responsible AI behaviors. However, the process typically requires substantial data and computation resources. Recent studies have revealed that alignment might be attainable at lower costs through simpler methods, such as in-context learning. This leads to the question: Is alignment predominantly superficial? In this paper, we delve into this question and provide a quantitative analysis. We formalize the concept of superficial knowledge, defining it as knowledge that can be acquired through easily token restyling, without affecting the model's ability to capture underlying causal relationships between tokens. We propose a method to extract and isolate superficial knowledge from aligned models, focusing on the shallow modifications to the final token selection process. By comparing models augmented only with superficial knowledge to fully aligned models, we quantify the superficial portion of alignment. Our findings reveal that while superficial knowledge constitutes a significant portion of alignment, particularly in safety and detoxification tasks, it is not the whole story. Tasks requiring reasoning and contextual understanding still rely on deeper knowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate two practical advantages of isolated superficial knowledge: (1) it can be transferred between models, enabling efficient offsite alignment of larger models using extracted superficial knowledge from smaller models, and (2) it is recoverable, allowing for the restoration of alignment in compromised models without sacrificing performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values through the lens of "superficial knowledge," which refers to knowledge that can be easily acquired through straightforward token restyling. The research provides a quantitative analysis of this concept, proposing a method to extract and isolate superficial knowledge from aligned models. The authors compare models that utilize superficial knowledge with those that are fully aligned, concluding that while superficial knowledge significantly contributes to alignment—particularly in areas like safety and detoxification—it does not encompass all alignment needs, especially those requiring deep reasoning and contextual understanding. Furthermore, the study reveals two benefits of targeting superficial knowledge: its transferability between models for efficient alignment and its recoverability for restoring compromised models without loss of performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces an original perspective on alignment, challenging the prevailing assumption that effective model alignment primarily requires deep understanding and extensive human feedback. By quantifying the contribution of superficial knowledge, the authors provide a framework that may influence how researchers approach model alignment in the future. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Concept:** The distinction between superficial and deeper knowledge in alignment is innovative, potentially altering future research directions. 2. **Quantitative Analysis:** The inclusion of methodology to extract and assess superficial knowledge contributes rigor and reproducibility to their findings. 3. **Practical Implications:** The paper outlines clear applications of the findings that could lead to efficiencies in model training and maintenance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the paper shines a light on superficial knowledge, it does not thoroughly explore the complexities of deeper knowledge that underpin reasoning tasks, which could limit broader applicability. 2. **Potential Simplification:** The reduction of alignment processes to superficial knowledge risks oversimplifying the nuanced challenges involved in achieving true alignment, particularly in diverse contexts. 3. **Generalizability:** The findings might not be universally applicable across all language models or tasks, which raises questions about the robustness of its claims. **Impact on the Field:** The work is likely to stimulate discussion around alignment practices and encourage researchers to explore alternative methods for alignment that are resource-efficient. However, the simplification of alignment processes needs careful consideration to ensure that critical issues are not overlooked. **Score: 8** The paper earns an 8 due to its innovative approach and potential influence on alignment techniques in LLMs. While it presents important insights, it also has not fully addressed the complexities of deeper knowledge in alignment, which prevents it from achieving the highest score.

- **Authors**: Khaled Sellami, Mohamed Aymen Saied
- **Abstract**: As Monolithic applications evolve, they become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve, leading to scaling and organizational issues. The Microservices architecture, known for its modularity, flexibility and scalability, offers a solution for large-scale applications allowing them to adapt and meet the demand on an ever increasing user base. Despite its advantages, migrating from a monolithic to a microservices architecture is often costly and complex, with the decomposition step being a significant challenge. This research addresses this issue by introducing MonoEmbed, a Language Model based approach for automating the decomposition process. MonoEmbed leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and representation learning techniques to generate representation vectors for monolithic components, which are then clustered to form microservices. By evaluating various pre-trained models and applying fine-tuning techniques such as Contrastive Learning and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), MonoEmbed aims to optimize these representations for microservice partitioning. The evaluation of the fine-tuned models showcases that they were able to significantly improve the quality of the representation vectors when compared with pre-trained models and traditional representations. The proposed approach was benchmarked against existing decomposition methods, demonstrating superior performance in generating cohesive and balanced microservices for monolithic applications with varying scales.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Contrastive Learning-Enhanced Large Language Models for Monolith-to-Microservice Decomposition" addresses the challenges of migrating applications from a monolithic architecture to a microservices architecture. The authors introduce a novel method called MonoEmbed, which utilizes advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the decomposition process. By generating representation vectors for components of monolithic applications and clustering these vectors, MonoEmbed seeks to effectively partition them into microservices. The method includes fine-tuning techniques such as Contrastive Learning and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance the quality of these representations. The authors present comparative evaluations against existing decomposition methods, demonstrating that MonoEmbed significantly outperforms traditional approaches in generating cohesive and balanced microservices, particularly for large-scale applications. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper rests in its application of modern representation learning techniques, particularly Contrastive Learning, to the specific problem of monolithic to microservices decomposition.

### AIQViT: Architecture-Informed Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04628v1)
- **Authors**: Runqing Jiang, Ye Zhang, Longguang Wang, Pengpeng Yu, Yulan Guo
- **Abstract**: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising solution for reducing the storage and computational cost of vision transformers (ViTs). Recent advances primarily target at crafting quantizers to deal with peculiar activations characterized by ViTs. However, most existing methods underestimate the information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant performance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common practice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ logarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative values around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies, ultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this paper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT (Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design an architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable low-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by weight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to accommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which dynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization resolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud classification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority of AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "AIQViT: Architecture-Informed Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers" addresses the challenge of performance degradation in vision transformers (ViTs) due to post-training quantization (PTQ). The authors highlight the limitations of existing PTQ methods that often overlook the detrimental effects of weight quantization, particularly under low-bit conditions. Common approaches that apply logarithmic transformations to post-Softmax activations also tend to prioritize less informative values, leading to inefficiencies in quantization. To tackle these issues, the paper introduces AIQViT, a novel PTQ method featuring an architecture-informed low-rank compensation mechanism that employs learnable low-rank weights to mitigate degradation from weight quantization. Additionally, a dynamic focusing quantizer is proposed to better manage the uneven distribution of post-Softmax activations, thereby optimizing quantization resolution. Empirical results across five vision tasks indicate that AIQViT outperforms existing state-of-the-art PTQ techniques. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** AIQViT presents novel contributions through its dual approach of low-rank compensation and dynamic focusing quantization. The low-rank compensation mechanism is particularly innovative as it directly addresses weight quantization degradation, a seldom-explored area in the PTQ literature. The dynamic focusing quantizer further showcases originality by adapting quantization strategies based on data distribution, challenging traditional fixed methods. **Significance:** The significance of the paper lies in its potential to enhance the efficiency of ViTs, which are increasingly utilized in diverse applications, from image classification to instance segmentation. As the demand for efficient deep learning models rises, especially in resource-constrained environments, AIQViT may provide crucial advancements in this field. **Strengths:** 1. **Depth of Innovation:** The paper proposes a comprehensive solution to known limitations in quantization approaches, specifically tailored to the architecture of ViTs. 2. **Robust Experimental Validation:** The use of extensive experiments across various vision tasks strengthens the validity of the proposed method, demonstrating its generalizability. 3. **Practical Implications:** The improvements in quantization efficiency could benefit real-world applications where model size and inference speed are critical. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The introduction of learnable low-rank weights and a dynamic quantization strategy may complicate the practical implementation, requiring additional training steps that might not be feasible in all scenarios. 2. **Limited Contextual Comparison:** Although experimental results are presented, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth comparison with a wider range of existing methods beyond the state-of-the-art listed. **Potential Influence:** AIQViT has the potential to influence future research by promoting awareness of the importance of quantization strategies that are specifically informed by model architecture. This could inspire further exploration into tailored quantization solutions across various architectures in deep learning. In conclusion, AIQViT advances the field of PTQ for vision transformers with significant innovations that address critical issues in current methodologies. The strengths of the approach, combined with its experimental backing, indicate strong potential impact, albeit tempered by challenges in implementation. **Score: 8**

### Confidence Elicitation: A New Attack Vector for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04643v1)
- **Authors**: Brian Formento, Chuan Sheng Foo, See-Kiong Ng
- **Abstract**: A fundamental issue in deep learning has been adversarial robustness. As these systems have scaled, such issues have persisted. Currently, large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial attacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat models have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings or output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been reasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no information about the model is available apart from the generated output. This means that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to detect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while having only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved through the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show that the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current LLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the likelihood of misclassification. Our new proposed paradigm demonstrates promising state-of-the-art results on three datasets across two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) when comparing our technique to existing hard-label black-box attack methods that introduce word-level substitutions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Confidence Elicitation: A New Attack Vector for Large Language Models" addresses the persistent issue of adversarial robustness in large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight a shift from gray-box to more restrictive black-box attack scenarios due to the emergence of closed-source models, where users have access only to model outputs without internal structure knowledge. The paper introduces a novel method for attack guidance by leveraging the model's output confidence—something that is typically overlooked in black-box settings. By eliciting this confidence and strategically minimizing it, the authors demonstrate an increased potential for misclassification in the model. Empirical results show that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing hard-label black-box attack techniques across three datasets and two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3). ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper presents a fresh approach to adversarial attacks by focusing on the elicitation of confidence as a means to guide black-box attacks. This is significant because prior work primarily focused on using hard-labels without exploiting the probabilistic outputs of models. This approach may provide a new angle from which to tackle robustness issues. **Significance**: Given the growing reliance on LLMs and the challenges related to their security, the insights presented in this paper are critical. By addressing the gap in methodologies for black-box attacks, the authors propose techniques that could potentially lead to improved defenses in the future. The empirical validation of the method across several models supports its relevance. **Strengths**: 1. The approach utilizes a novel mechanism (confidence elicitation) that is underexplored in black-box adversarial settings. 2. The paper compares its results against existing methods, showcasing substantial improvements in performance. 3. The empirical workload on multiple models and datasets lends credibility to the proposed method’s effectiveness. **Weaknesses**: 1. The reliance on specific models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) may limit the generalizability of findings; it would have been beneficial to explore a wider variety of architectures. 2. The paper could have offered deeper insights into the implications of the results—such as potential real-world attack scenarios or defensive measures. **Influence on the Field**: Should this methodology gain traction, it may inspire further research into confidence-based manipulations in adversarial settings, leading to improved designs of language models and more robust adversarial defenses. **Score**: 8   *The score reflects the innovative approach and potential impact on the field, while acknowledging the limitations in breadth of tested models and the need for expanded discussions on real-world applicability.*

### Enhancing Health Information Retrieval with RAG by Prioritizing Topical Relevance and Factual Accuracy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04666v1)
- **Authors**: Rishabh Uapadhyay, Marco Viviani
- **Abstract**: The exponential surge in online health information, coupled with its increasing use by non-experts, highlights the pressing need for advanced Health Information Retrieval models that consider not only topical relevance but also the factual accuracy of the retrieved information, given the potential risks associated with health misinformation. To this aim, this paper introduces a solution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the capabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the retrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In particular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's query is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated references from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the second stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by LLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last stage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the point of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their comparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic similarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a layer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning behind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark datasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate health information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health misinformation mitigation problem.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the critical issue of health misinformation in the context of increasing online health information by developing a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model focused on improving health information retrieval through a dual lens of topical relevance and factual accuracy. The proposed three-stage model retrieves relevant health passages from a knowledge database, generates rich, contextually appropriate text with LLMs, and evaluates both the relevance and factual accuracy of the documents using comparisons with the generated text. This methodology not only enhances the retrieval process but also provides an explanatory layer regarding factual accuracy, which is crucial for users' understanding. Experimental evaluations suggest that the model outperforms existing baselines, marking significant progress in mitigating health misinformation. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a compelling approach that integrates the high-level capabilities of LLMs with a structured retrieval process to tackle the urgent issue of health misinformation. This approach's novelty lies fundamentally in its synergy between retrieval and generation—an area that has seen limited exploration, especially specifically applied to health information. The model's multi-faceted methodology, which includes both stance detection and semantic similarity assessments, demonstrates depth in addressing the problem, which is commendable. However, a critical weakness resides in the dependency on existing knowledge bases, which may not always reflect the latest or most accurate health information, given the rapid advancements in medical science. Additionally, while the paper claims improved retrieval of factually accurate information, it would benefit from a more in-depth discussion of the methods used to assess factual accuracy and potential biases within generated content. The reliance on LLMs also raises questions about the reproducibility of the results based on the inherent variability in generated text across different scenarios. Overall, the paper’s effective use of LLMs to enhance the reliability of health information retrieval is a significant contribution to the field, particularly as misinformation remains a growing concern. The explanations accompanying retrieved documents can greatly aid users' understanding, which is an important aspect currently lacking in traditional health information retrieval systems. This mechanism gives it practical relevance, boosting its impact within both academic and real-world applications. Considering these aspects, I assess the paper’s novelty and significance within the field of health information retrieval as moderately high, primarily due to its innovative integration of RAG with an explicit focus on factual accuracy.  **Score: 8**

### Unveiling the Mechanisms of Explicit CoT Training: How Chain-of-Thought Enhances Reasoning Generalization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04667v1)
- **Authors**: Xinhao Yao, Ruifeng Ren, Yun Liao, Yong Liu
- **Abstract**: Training large language models (LLMs) with high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations has become a widely adopted strategy due to its significant enhancement of reasoning capabilities. To fully comprehend this approach, two questions naturally arise: (Q1) What advantages does training with CoT offer compared to training without CoT? (Q2) If there are advantages, what are the underlying mechanisms of explicit CoT training? Analyzing the advantages and mechanisms of CoT training is challenging due to the many factors involved. To address this, we conduct a detailed analysis using clear and controllable data distributions and, for the first time, reveal that CoT training offers the following advantages: (1) Training with CoT markedly improves reasoning generalization, extending it from in-distribution (ID) to both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, while also speeding up convergence; (2) Even when training with CoT includes a certain range of erroneous reasoning steps, it still enables the model to learn reasoning patterns, leading to systematic generalization. We further explore the underlying mechanisms from a circuit perspective: (1) The data distribution (e.g., ratio $\lambda$ and pattern) plays a crucial role in influencing the model's systematic generalization; (2) CoT training (with two-hop facts) internalizes reasoning into a two-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the explicit reasoning steps during training. Our findings elucidate the mechanisms underlying explicit CoT training and offer critical insights into tuning strategies for LLMs to achieve robust generalization.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the impact and mechanisms of explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). It addresses two critical questions: the advantages of CoT training over traditional methods, and the underlying mechanisms at play. The authors discover that CoT training significantly boosts reasoning generalization across both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while also expediting convergence times. They note that even with some erroneous reasoning steps integrated, the models can still extract valuable reasoning patterns leading to systematic generalization. From a mechanistic perspective, they find that factors such as data distribution greatly influence systematic generalization. The study introduces the idea of a two-stage reasoning circuit, reflecting explicit reasoning steps in training. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights for tuning LLMs to promote robust generalization. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The exploration of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in LLMs is an emerging area, and this paper presents a novel investigation into its specific advantages and mechanisms which add significantly to the existing body of knowledge. The focus on systematic generalization across varying distributions (ID and OOD) and the introduction of a reasoning circuit model are noteworthy contributions that could steer future research directions.  **Strengths:** 1. **Systematic Approach**: The authors employ clear and controllable data distributions, which lends credibility to their findings and allows for a more rigorous examination of cognitive processes. 2. **Clear Advancements**: The paper identifies distinct advantages of CoT training, which is essential for understanding its effectiveness and providing actionable insights for model training strategies. 3. **Mechanistic Insights**: By linking reasoning processes to specific circuit designs, the paper provides a framework that could inspire both theoretical and practical advancements in the construction of reasoning systems in AI. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Investigation**: While the paper addresses specific mechanisms, it does not explore the broader implications of these findings in diverse applications, which may limit its immediate applicability in real-world scenarios. 2. **Generalizability**: Although the findings are promising, further validation across a wider range of tasks and model architectures is necessary to establish the robustness of the conclusions. **Influence on the Field**: The insights provided by this paper could influence researchers and practitioners in refining training techniques for LLMs, promoting a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that govern reasoning and generalization in AI systems. Based on these evaluations, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. This score reflects its considerable contributions to understanding CoT mechanisms within LLM training, balanced against the need for broader application and further testing in diverse contexts.  **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for generative tasks, producing high-quality outputs across diverse domains. However, how the generated data responds to the initial noise perturbation in diffusion models remains under-explored, which hinders understanding the controllability of the sampling process. In this work, we first observe an interesting phenomenon: the relationship between the change of generation outputs and the scale of initial noise perturbation is highly linear through the diffusion ODE sampling. Then we provide both theoretical and empirical study to justify this linearity property of this input-output (noise-generation data) relationship. Inspired by these new insights, we propose a novel Controllable and Constrained Sampling method (CCS) together with a new controller algorithm for diffusion models to sample with desired statistical properties while preserving good sample quality. We perform extensive experiments to compare our proposed sampling approach with other methods on both sampling controllability and sampled data quality. Results show that our CCS method achieves more precisely controlled sampling while maintaining superior sample quality and diversity.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "CCS: Controllable and Constrained Sampling with Diffusion Models via Initial Noise Perturbation" investigates the effects of initial noise perturbation on the output of diffusion models, a significant area that has not yet been fully explored. The authors identify a linear relationship between the scale of initial noise perturbation and the generated output during diffusion ODE sampling. They support this assertion through both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence. Building on these findings, they introduce a new sampling method, CCS (Controllable and Constrained Sampling), along with a novel controller algorithm designed to yield samples with specific statistical properties while preserving quality. Their extensive experimentation indicates that CCS achieves better control over sampling while ensuring high quality and diversity of the generated data compared to existing methods. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty and Insights:** The identification of a linear relationship in noise perturbation effects is a key contribution. This insight could provide a foundational understanding for future modifications and improvements in diffusion models. 2. **Development of CCS:** Introducing a systematic method that allows for controllable and constrained sampling extends the current capabilities of diffusion models, potentially optimizing their use in various applications. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The rigorous experimental comparisons with existing methods bolster the claims made regarding the effectiveness of CCS, providing evidence that supports the proposed method's claims about quality and controllability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Grounding:** While the paper provides both theoretical and empirical justifications, there may be skepticism about the general applicability of the observed linearity. Further theoretical exploration across various contexts within diffusion models could enhance this aspect. 2. **Scope of Experiments:** The paper does not specify the breadth of variability in the tasks or domains in which CCS was tested. Diversity in evaluation settings strengthens generalizability, and the findings could be more impactful if extended across different types of generative tasks. 3. **Algorithm Complexity:** The proposed algorithms might introduce additional computational overhead. The trade-off between improved controllability and computational efficiency should be addressed. **Influence on the Field:** This work contributes to the ongoing development of generative models, particularly in enhancing their controllability and usability. By addressing the gap in understanding the impact of noise perturbation, this paper paves the way for more robust applications of diffusion models across fields such as image generation, audio synthesis, and more. CCS has the potential to be integrated into existing frameworks, fostering innovation in how generative tasks are executed. **Score Justification:** Given the paper's significant contribution to understanding and improving diffusion models coupled with practical implications, I assign it a score of **8**. The insights regarding noise perturbation are valuable, but the theoretical foundations and potential implementation complexities keep it from reaching the highest echelons of impact and novelty. The clear validation of the CCS method is promising, yet further exploration in diverse contexts could enhance its significance. **Score: 8**

### LLM Query Scheduling with Prefix Reuse and Latency Constraints
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04677v1)
- **Authors**: Gregory Dexter, Shao Tang, Ata Fatahi Baarzi, Qingquan Song, Tejas Dharamsi, Aman Gupta
- **Abstract**: The efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in online settings requires optimizing inference performance under stringent latency constraints, particularly the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). This paper focuses on the query scheduling problem for LLM inference with prefix reuse, a technique that leverages shared prefixes across queries to reduce computational overhead. Our work reveals previously unknown limitations of the existing first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) scheduling strategies with respect to satisfying latency constraints. We present a formal theoretical framework for LLM query scheduling under RadixAttention, a prefix reuse mechanism that stores and reuses intermediate representations in a radix tree structure. Our analysis establishes the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem with prefix reuse under TTFT constraints and proposes a novel scheduling algorithm, $k$-LPM, which generalizes existing methods by balancing prefix reuse and fairness in query processing. Theoretical guarantees demonstrate that $k$-LPM achieves improved TTFT performance under realistic traffic patterns captured by a data generative model. Empirical evaluations in a realistic serving setting validates our findings, showing significant reductions in P99 TTFT compared to baseline methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "LLM Query Scheduling with Prefix Reuse and Latency Constraints" addresses the optimization of inference performance for large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the scheduling of queries in a way that meets strict latency requirements, such as time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-per-output-token (TPOT). The authors introduce a novel approach that utilizes prefix reuse to minimize computation by recognizing and sharing common prefixes across different queries. They identify limitations with existing scheduling strategies like first-come-first-serve (FCFS) and longest-prefix-match (LPM) in adhering to latency constraints.  The authors develop a theoretical framework for scheduling queries using RadixAttention, a structure that enables the storage and reuse of intermediate representations efficiently. They prove the NP-hardness of the scheduling problem under TTFT constraints and propose a new algorithm, $k$-LPM, which aims to balance prefix reuse with fairness in handling queries. Theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that $k$-LPM significantly reduces TTFT in practical settings compared to baseline approaches. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper establishes the NP-hardness of the query scheduling problem with prefix reuse, contributing to a deeper understanding of computational limits within LLM inference. 2. **Novel Algorithm:** The introduction of the $k$-LPM algorithm is a substantial contribution, as it combines prefix reuse and fairness in a novel way, which is crucial for real-world applications where both performance and equitability are essential. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide empirical results that practically validate their theoretical findings, showcasing significant improvements in TTFT, which is highly relevant for LLM deployment scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity Assumptions:** While the NP-hardness proof is a strong theoretical result, it would be beneficial to discuss the complexity of the proposed $k$-LPM algorithm in practical terms, including how it scales with varying input sizes and query patterns. 2. **Limited Scope:** The focus on TTFT and TPOT may overlook other relevant metrics that could impact user experience, such as throughput or overall system resource utilization, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the scheduling algorithm. 3. **Comparison with More Algorithms:** Although baseline comparisons are presented, the paper could benefit from comparing $k$-LPM against a wider range of contemporary scheduling algorithms to fully contextualize its performance improvements. **Overall Significance:** This paper provides important insights into optimizing LLM inference under latency constraints while introducing a viable new algorithm that addresses key issues in query scheduling. Its potential impact is significant as efficiency in LLM deployment becomes increasingly critical. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to both theory and practice within the field of large language models, while acknowledging the limitations and areas for further exploration. The balance of novelty and empirical relevance positions it as an important work, albeit with room for broader application and scope in future research.

### Mechanistic Understandings of Representation Vulnerabilities and Engineering Robust Vision Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04679v1)
- **Authors**: Chashi Mahiul Islam, Samuel Jacob Chacko, Mao Nishino, Xiuwen Liu
- **Abstract**: While transformer-based models dominate NLP and vision applications, their underlying mechanisms to map the input space to the label space semantically are not well understood. In this paper, we study the sources of known representation vulnerabilities of vision transformers (ViT), where perceptually identical images can have very different representations and semantically unrelated images can have the same representation. Our analysis indicates that imperceptible changes to the input can result in significant representation changes, particularly in later layers, suggesting potential instabilities in the performance of ViTs. Our comprehensive study reveals that adversarial effects, while subtle in early layers, propagate and amplify through the network, becoming most pronounced in middle to late layers. This insight motivates the development of NeuroShield-ViT, a novel defense mechanism that strategically neutralizes vulnerable neurons in earlier layers to prevent the cascade of adversarial effects. We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness across various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative attacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. Without fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on adversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods. Our results shed new light on how adversarial effects propagate through ViT layers, while providing a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks. Additionally, they provide a promising approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers against adversarial attacks.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper investigates the representation vulnerabilities in vision transformers (ViTs), which are known for their performance in various computer vision tasks. The authors find that tiny, imperceptible changes in input can lead to considerable shifts in output representations, especially in the deeper layers of the network, suggesting a potential instability in model performance. Through a detailed analysis, they reveal that adversarial attacks tend to start subtle but become more pronounced in middle to late layers of ViTs. To address this issue, the authors propose NeuroShield-ViT, a defense mechanism designed to neutralize particularly vulnerable neurons early in the layers to prevent the amplification of adversarial effects. The results presented in the paper demonstrate that NeuroShield-ViT shows significant effectiveness against various attacks, particularly strong iterative ones, achieving competitive accuracy (77.8%) on adversarial examples without any fine-tuning. The findings offer important insights into the behavior of adversarial vulnerabilities in ViTs and propose a novel approach to bolster their robustness against such threats. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty: 8/10** The paper presents a notable contribution to the understanding of representation vulnerabilities in ViTs and introduces a novel approach to mitigate these vulnerabilities. The analysis of how adversarial effects propagate through the layers is crucial, as previous works have focused on the robustness aspects often without delving deep into the mechanistic understanding of representation shifts. This contributes significantly to the field, as understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing more robust models. **Strengths:** 1. **In-depth Analysis:** The examination of how input perturbations influence representations across different layers provides new insights into the workings of ViTs, filling an important gap in the existing literature on adversarial robustness. 2. **Novel Defense Mechanism:** The introduction of NeuroShield-ViT offers a practical strategy to enhance model robustness, which could inspire further research in defense mechanisms not just for ViTs but for other architectures as well. 3. **Empirical Results:** The empirical validation showing competitive accuracy against adversarial examples strengthens the claims made, demonstrating real-world applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Defense:** While the proposed mechanism is promising, it may not generalize effectively across all types of adversarial attacks or tasks in vision. Future research may need to explore its robustness across a wider range of scenarios. 2. **Contextual Considerations:** The abstract mentions "zero-shot generalization capabilities," which could require further clarification and empirical evidence in the main text, as it is a significant claim that may need more thorough exploration. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** Although comparisons to conventional robustness methods are mentioned, a more detailed analysis discussing specific metrics and a wider range of benchmarks could provide stronger context for the effectiveness of the proposed method. **Potential Influence on the Field:** The insights regarding how adversarial changes propagate in ViTs may catalyze further research into the structural vulnerabilities of other neural architectures. Additionally, by presenting a solid defense mechanism, the paper might influence future work in building more resilient models in adversarial settings. The work sets a foundation upon which other researchers might build novel methods for improving the robustness of deep learning models across applications. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Mengdi Liu, Zhangyang Gao, Hong Chang, Stan Z. Li, Shiguang Shan, Xinlin Chen
- **Abstract**: Discovering the genotype-phenotype relationship is crucial for genetic engineering, which will facilitate advances in fields such as crop breeding, conservation biology, and personalized medicine. Current research usually focuses on single species and small datasets due to limitations in phenotypic data collection, especially for traits that require visual assessments or physical measurements. Deciphering complex and composite phenotypes, such as morphology, from genetic data at scale remains an open question. To break through traditional generic models that rely on simplified assumptions, this paper introduces G2PDiffusion, the first-of-its-kind diffusion model designed for genotype-to-phenotype generation across multiple species. Specifically, we use images to represent morphological phenotypes across species and redefine phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. To this end, this paper introduces an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and trains a stable diffusion model with a novel alignment method to improve genotype-to-phenotype consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances phenotype prediction accuracy across species, capturing subtle genetic variations that contribute to observable traits.
- **Summary**: **Summary of G2PDiffusion: Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction with Diffusion Models** The paper presents G2PDiffusion, an innovative diffusion model designed to predict the relationship between genotype and phenotype across multiple species, addressing challenges in phenotype assessment often seen in genetic engineering. Traditional methods were limited to single species and small data sets due to difficulties in collecting comprehensive phenotypic data. The authors propose a new approach by utilizing images to represent morphological traits and redefining phenotype prediction as conditional image generation. Key innovations include an environment-enhanced DNA sequence conditioner and a novel alignment method to train a stable diffusion model, which collectively aim to improve the consistency between genotype and phenotype predictions. Results from extensive experiments indicate that G2PDiffusion significantly enhances accuracy in phenotype prediction and successfully captures intricate genetic variants influencing observable traits. **Critical Evaluation** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: G2PDiffusion represents a significant step forward in genotype-to-phenotype research by utilizing diffusion models, a relatively new paradigm in this field. This approach allows for the generation of complex phenotypic representations, which traditional methods are often unable to achieve. 2. **Broad Applicability**: By targeting multiple species, the model has the potential to influence various fields such as agriculture and medicine, making its applications broader than existing models that focus on single species. 3. **Methodological Advancement**: The integration of image-based phenotyping with advanced sequencing techniques exemplifies a crucial methodological advancement, addressing the limitations of prior models that relied on simplified genetic data. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality and Validation**: While the paper demonstrates improved accuracy, it would benefit from a broader evaluation across more diverse and representative datasets. The reliance on specific species for initial validation might limit the generalizability of findings. 2. **Complexity and Interpretability**: The model's complexity may pose interpretability challenges, which is critical for biological applications. A trade-off between predictive power and the ability to interpret the model outputs must be discussed further. 3. **Computational Resources**: Implementing sophisticated models like G2PDiffusion may require significant computational resources, which could be a barrier for widespread adoption in less resource-rich settings. **Potential Influence**: The introduction of G2PDiffusion can catalyze significant advancements in understanding genotype-phenotype relationships, potentially leading to enhancements in crop breeding and personalized medicine. However, its real-world applicability will depend on future research that addresses its strengths and weaknesses. **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the field with substantial methodological innovations and the potential for wide-ranging applications. The paper's novelty is noteworthy, but concerns about validation, generality, and practical implementation warrant some caution, preventing a perfect score. Overall, G2PDiffusion is a promising step in unraveling complex biological data into understandable and useful models.

### M-IFEval: Multilingual Instruction-Following Evaluation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04688v1)
- **Authors**: Antoine Dussolle, Andrea Cardeña Díaz, Shota Sato, Peter Devine
- **Abstract**: Instruction following is a core capability of modern Large language models (LLMs), making evaluating this capability essential to understanding these models. The Instruction Following Evaluation (IFEval) benchmark from the literature does this using objective criteria, offering a measure of LLM performance without subjective AI or human judgement. However, it only includes English instructions, limiting its ability to assess LLMs in other languages. We propose the Multilingual Instruction Following Evaluation (M-IFEval) benchmark, expanding the evaluation to French, Japanese, and Spanish, with both general and language-specific instructions. Applying this benchmark to 8 state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that benchmark performance across languages and instruction types can vary widely, underscoring the importance of a multilingual benchmark for evaluating LLMs in a diverse cultural context.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Multilingual Instruction Following Evaluation (M-IFEval) benchmark to address the limitations of the existing Instruction Following Evaluation (IFEval) framework, which only assesses English instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). M-IFEval expands the assessment to include French, Japanese, and Spanish, offering both general and language-specific instruction sets. The authors evaluate eight leading LLMs using this multilingual benchmark, revealing significant variations in performance across different languages and types of instructions. This highlights the need for multilingual evaluation frameworks that better represent diverse linguistic contexts. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the M-IFEval benchmark lies in its attempt to broaden the scope of instruction-following evaluation from solely English to include multiple languages. Given that LLMs are deployed globally, this expansion is timely and pertinent, addressing a significant gap in the evaluation frameworks currently available in the field. Strengths of the paper include its proactive approach to inclusivity in LLM evaluation, which is crucial as AI technology continues to advance and be disseminated across linguistic boundaries. The empirical evaluation involving eight state-of-the-art LLMs offers robust data that underscores the intricacies in performance across languages, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of LLM capabilities. However, the paper has limitations. The chosen languages (French, Japanese, and Spanish) may not reflect a truly diverse linguistic landscape, as many languages and dialects remain unaddressed. Additionally, while the benchmark includes general and language-specific instructions, it would benefit from discussing operationalization of these instructions and how they relate to practical use cases. The paper could also enhance its impact by considering cultural nuances that may affect instruction interpretation across languages. In terms of significance, introducing a multilingual evaluation is a step forward, but further development could enhance its comprehensiveness and applicability. The importance of a vibrant evaluation framework that captures a wide range of languages cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the fairness and effectiveness of LLMs in a global context. Given the combination of its strengths, limitations, and the context in which it resides in the overall field of LLM research, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid contribution with significant potential influence, while also acknowledging areas for improvement and expansion in future work. **Score: 7**

### ARR: Question Answering with Large Language Models via Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04689v1)
- **Authors**: Yuwei Yin, Giuseppe Carenini
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance on challenging benchmarks that are often structured as multiple-choice question-answering (QA) tasks. Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning in LLMs but provides only vague and generic guidance ("think step by step"). This paper introduces ARR, an intuitive and effective zero-shot prompting method that explicitly incorporates three key steps in QA solving: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning step by step. Comprehensive experiments across diverse and challenging QA tasks demonstrate that ARR consistently improves the Baseline (without ARR prompting) and outperforms CoT. Ablation and case studies further validate the positive contributions of each component: analyzing, retrieving, and reasoning. Notably, intent analysis plays a vital role in ARR. Additionally, extensive evaluations across various model sizes, LLM series, and generation settings solidify the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of ARR.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "ARR: Question Answering with Large Language Models via Analyzing, Retrieving, and Reasoning" presents a novel prompting method called ARR to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in question-answering tasks. While existing methods like Zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt LLMs to reason, they lack specificity and clarity in guiding the reasoning process. ARR explicitly divides the QA solving process into three crucial steps: analyzing the intent of the question, retrieving relevant information, and reasoning through it. The authors conduct extensive experiments demonstrating that ARR consistently enhances LLM performance across various QA tasks and outperforms the CoT approach. Key findings indicate that intent analysis plays a significant role in the overall effectiveness of ARR, and evaluations across different model sizes and settings affirm its robustness and generalizability. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty and Significance The paper aims to advance the field of question answering by disrupting the existing paradigm of zero-shot reasoning prompts through a systematic and structured approach. The introduction of explicit steps—analyzing, retrieving, and reasoning—adds noteworthy novelty compared to traditional methods. The findings indicate a clear improvement over standard practices, which may inspire further research into detailed prompt methodologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Clear Structure:** The division of the question-answering process into discrete, manageable steps is intuitive and could enhance user understanding and implementation. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper provides comprehensive experimental results that back its claims, reinforcing the reliability of the proposed method. 3. **Robustness Across Settings:** The demonstration of effectiveness across various model sizes and tasks adds credibility and generalizes the findings beyond specific cases. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the paper claims broad applicability, the effectiveness of ARR in exceptionally diverse domains or novel problem types remains untested. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the results outperform CoT, a deeper examination of how ARR interacts with different types of reasoning tasks (e.g., complex logical deductions) would enhance its relevance. 3. **Limited Exploration of Components:** The ablation studies validate the components of ARR, but the authors could explore optimizing individual steps further or adapting the method to improve specific facets of QA performance. #### Potential Influence on the Field The method presented could catalyze shifts in how researchers and developers employ LLMs for QA tasks, steering them towards structured prompting techniques rather than relying solely on broad reasoning prompts. The emphasis on an analysis phase may lead to richer contextual understanding in LLMs, potentially improving outputs in real-world applications such as education, research, and customer support. ### Score: 8 The score reflects strong novelty and significance due to the structured approach introduced alongside reliable experimental validation. However, the limitations in generalization and depth of comparative analysis prevent it from achieving the highest score. The paper represents a meaningful contribution that could influence future research directions, making ARR a notable advancement within the evolving landscape of question answering with LLMs.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04692v1)
- **Authors**: Zhenwei Wu, Jinxiong Lu, Yuxiao Chen, Yunxin Liu, Yueting Zhuang, Luhui Hu
- **Abstract**: Humanoid robotics presents significant challenges in artificial intelligence, requiring precise coordination and control of high-degree-of-freedom systems. Designing effective reward functions for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this domain remains a critical bottleneck, demanding extensive manual effort, domain expertise, and iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STRIDE, a novel framework built on agentic engineering to automate reward design, DRL training, and feedback optimization for humanoid robot locomotion tasks. By combining the structured principles of agentic engineering with large language models (LLMs) for code-writing, zero-shot generation, and in-context optimization, STRIDE generates, evaluates, and iteratively refines reward functions without relying on task-specific prompts or templates. Across diverse environments featuring humanoid robot morphologies, STRIDE outperforms the state-of-the-art reward design framework EUREKA, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and task performance. Using STRIDE-generated rewards, simulated humanoid robots achieve sprint-level locomotion across complex terrains, highlighting its ability to advance DRL workflows and humanoid robotics research.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents STRIDE, a novel framework aimed at automating the traditionally labor-intensive processes of reward design, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) training, and feedback optimization specifically for humanoid robotics locomotion. It addresses the challenges of creating effective reward functions, which typically require significant domain expertise and manual iteration. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) within the structured principles of agentic engineering, STRIDE efficiently generates, evaluates, and refines reward functions with minimal human intervention. The results demonstrate that STRIDE exceeds the performance of the existing state-of-the-art framework (EUREKA) in various humanoid robot scenarios, enabling simulated robots to achieve advanced locomotion capabilities over complex terrains. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper exhibits substantial novelty through its integration of large language models into the field of humanoid robotics, particularly in automating reward design and optimization processes. The utilization of LLMs in a systematic and domain-relevant manner presents a significant advancement over traditional methods that rely heavily on manual design. Furthermore, STRIDE's effectiveness across diverse environments positions it as a versatile tool for researchers and practitioners in robotics. However, while the theoretical implications of STRIDE are notable, the practical aspects require further scrutiny. For instance, the paper should provide additional insights and validation of its performance relative to more varied and dynamically changing real-world scenarios, as simulated environments may not fully encapsulate the complexities found in real-world humanoid locomotion tasks. Additionally, the computational complexity and resource requirements of using LLMs in training frameworks should be addressed, as they could limit the accessibility of the proposed framework for broader application within the robotics community. Overall, STRIDE represents a meaningful contribution to the field of humanoid robotics and reinforcement learning, primarily by streamlining processes that have historically been barriers to progress. Its ability to enhance robotic locomotion capabilities suggests considerable potential for future research and application. **Score: 8**

### Evaluating Text Style Transfer Evaluation: Are There Any Reliable Metrics?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04718v1)
- **Authors**: Sourabrata Mukherjee, Atul Kr. Ojha, John P. McCrae, Ondrej Dusek
- **Abstract**: Text Style Transfer (TST) is the task of transforming a text to reflect a particular style while preserving its original content. Evaluating TST outputs is a multidimensional challenge, requiring the assessment of style transfer accuracy, content preservation, and naturalness. Using human evaluation is ideal but costly, same as in other natural language processing (NLP) tasks, however, automatic metrics for TST have not received as much attention as metrics for, e.g., machine translation or summarization. In this paper, we examine both set of existing and novel metrics from broader NLP tasks for TST evaluation, focusing on two popular subtasks-sentiment transfer and detoxification-in a multilingual context comprising English, Hindi, and Bengali. By conducting meta-evaluation through correlation with human judgments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these metrics when used individually and in ensembles. Additionally, we investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as tools for TST evaluation. Our findings highlight that certain advanced NLP metrics and experimental-hybrid-techniques, provide better insights than existing TST metrics for delivering more accurate, consistent, and reproducible TST evaluations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Evaluating Text Style Transfer Evaluation: Are There Any Reliable Metrics?" explores the complexities of evaluating Text Style Transfer (TST), which involves modifying the style of a text while retaining its original message. The authors highlight that, unlike other NLP tasks such as machine translation and summarization, TST has not seen extensive development of automatic evaluation metrics. They analyze both existing and new metrics across various NLP tasks, focusing on sentiment transfer and detoxification within a multilingual framework (English, Hindi, and Bengali). Through meta-evaluation correlated with human judgments, they assess the effectiveness of these metrics individually and in combination. The study also investigates the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for TST evaluation. Results indicate that advanced NLP metrics and hybrid techniques yield more reliable evaluations compared to traditional TST metrics. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of TST evaluation metrics, an area that is often underexplored compared to other NLP domains. Its focus on a multilingual context and the inclusion of sentiment transfer and detoxification are significant, as they shed light on the challenges of style transfer across diverse languages and styles. The use of meta-evaluation against human judgments provides a solid foundation to assess the reliability of proposed metrics, thus enhancing the rigor of the study. However, there are some shortcomings. The paper could benefit from a broader exploration of what constitutes "style"—particularly in contextualizing styles beyond sentiment and detoxification (e.g., dialectical variations, formal vs. informal styles). Furthermore, while the authors suggest the potential of using LLMs as evaluative tools, they do not delve deeply into practical implementations or the limitations of relying on LLM outputs, which could pose a risk of further complicating evaluations given their contextual sensitivity. Additionally, while the authors successfully highlight the advantages of certain metrics, they could enhance arguments by systematically comparing their proposed methods to established metrics in controlled experiments. This would further confirm the improvements claimed. Given the above analysis, the novelty lies in the focused effort to address a gap in an important area of NLP, but the range of contributions could have been broader, and deeper explorations of some claims could enhance the paper's impact. **Score: 7**  The score reflects a commendable effort in advancing TST evaluation, but limitations in scope and depth diminish its overall significance, preventing it from being an exceptional contribution. The potential to influence future work in the field is clear, though more extensive evidence and applications would have strengthened its case.

### Can Diffusion Models Learn Hidden Inter-Feature Rules Behind Images?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04725v1)
- **Authors**: Yujin Han, Andi Han, Wei Huang, Chaochao Lu, Difan Zou
- **Abstract**: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models (DMs) in data generation, they exhibit specific failure cases with unsatisfactory outputs. We focus on one such limitation: the ability of DMs to learn hidden rules between image features. Specifically, for image data with dependent features ($\mathbf{x}$) and ($\mathbf{y}$) (e.g., the height of the sun ($\mathbf{x}$) and the length of the shadow ($\mathbf{y}$)), we investigate whether DMs can accurately capture the inter-feature rule ($p(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})$). Empirical evaluations on mainstream DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3.5) reveal consistent failures, such as inconsistent lighting-shadow relationships and mismatched object-mirror reflections. Inspired by these findings, we design four synthetic tasks with strongly correlated features to assess DMs' rule-learning abilities. Extensive experiments show that while DMs can identify coarse-grained rules, they struggle with fine-grained ones. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that DMs trained via denoising score matching (DSM) exhibit constant errors in learning hidden rules, as the DSM objective is not compatible with rule conformity. To mitigate this, we introduce a common technique - incorporating additional classifier guidance during sampling, which achieves (limited) improvements. Our analysis reveals that the subtle signals of fine-grained rules are challenging for the classifier to capture, providing insights for future exploration.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the capacity of diffusion models (DMs), particularly focusing on their ability to learn hidden inter-feature rules in image data. The authors identify specific failure cases in DMs related to inconsistencies in relationships between dependent features, such as lighting conditions and shadow lengths. Through experimental evaluations of mainstream DMs like Stable Diffusion 3.5, they find that while DMs can grasp coarse rules, they struggle with finer distinctions. Theoretical analysis indicates that traditional denoising score matching (DSM) may lead to persistent errors in learning these hidden rules. To improve learning outcomes, the authors propose using classifier guidance during sampling, although this approach leads to only modest improvements. Their findings highlight the difficulty of capturing subtle signals associated with fine-grained rules, suggesting avenues for future research. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its focused examination of diffusion models' limitations, particularly the ability to learn subtle inter-feature relationships, which has not been extensively addressed in previous literature. By systematically evaluating and identifying specific failure scenarios, the authors contribute valuable insights into the operational boundaries of DMs, which is crucial for their continued development and optimization. The design of synthetic tasks tailored to unravel these capabilities adds a methodological depth to the investigation. However, the paper could strengthen its impact by offering a more robust theoretical framework to support its claims about the inadequacies of existing methodologies. The proposed solutions, while showing some promise, lack a thorough exploration of why classifier guidance is limited in its effectiveness. They could also delve deeper into the implications of their findings for real-world applications of DMs and potential workarounds for the highlighted shortcomings. The empirical results are significant but need clearer contextualization, as understanding the real-world relevance of these inter-feature rules in practical applications of DMs would enhance the paper's contribution. Additionally, addressing the implications of their limitations on the design of future generative models would offer a more comprehensive perspective on their work. Given these strengths and weaknesses, the paper presents intriguing insights that could influence future research and development in this area. It engages with an important aspect of model performance and lays the groundwork for further exploration but could have benefited from deeper theoretical insights and more concrete applications. **Score: 7**

### Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728v1)
- **Authors**: Zhouliang Yu, Yuhuan Yuan, Tim Z. Xiao, Fuxiang Frank Xia, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang, Ge Lin, Weiyang Liu
- **Abstract**: Solving complex planning problems requires Large Language Models (LLMs) to explicitly model the state transition to avoid rule violations, comply with constraints, and ensure optimality-a task hindered by the inherent ambiguity of natural language. To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and formal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model where classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to find optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs remains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address this challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to enhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of high-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective algorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the quality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained manner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a considerable margin in the generation of PDDL domain, achieving over 50% success rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language description or PDDL problems). This is done without requiring additional training. By taking advantage of PDDL as state abstraction, our method is able to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on almost all competition-level planning tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper proposes a novel approach to overcoming the challenges faced in solving complex planning problems with Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs struggle to accurately model state transitions due to the ambiguity of natural language, which is crucial for avoiding rule violations and meeting constraints in planning tasks. To address this, the authors leverage the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as a formal abstraction that provides precise state descriptions, enabling the effective application of classic search algorithms like A*. However, generating PDDL domains from LLMs remains challenging due to limited training data. The authors introduce an innovative method that scales up test-time computations of LLMs, utilizing a Best-of-N sampling technique followed by refinement through verbalized machine learning. Their approach significantly improves PDDL domain generation, achieving over a 50% success rate on two tasks without any additional training, and outperforms existing methods across competitive planning tasks. **Critical Evaluation:**  The paper presents a compelling method that directly addresses a significant gap in applying LLMs for planning problems by successfully bridging natural language ambiguity with formal representation in PDDL. One of the primary strengths of this work is its focus on enhancing existing LLMs without requiring extensive retraining, which is often a considerable barrier in AI applications. The introduction of a Best-of-N sampling approach combined with verbalized machine learning appears to be an original contribution that enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of PDDL generation. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the limitations of their method or how it might perform in diverse real-world scenarios beyond the two tasks evaluated. Additionally, while the achieved success rate is notable, more extensive benchmarks would help validate the generalizability and robustness of the approach across various planning challenges.  Furthermore, the limited exploration of why current state-of-the-art methods failed in comparison could detract from understanding the novelty of the presented technique. A deeper theoretical exploration of the limitations regarding PDDL generation might also provide more context for the impact of this research. Overall, while the paper offers an interesting and promising advancement in the area of symbolic world modeling via LLMs, its impact could be strengthened through further validation and contextualization of its findings.  **Score: 8**

### Every Software as an Agent: Blueprint and Case Study
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04747v1)
- **Authors**: Mengwei Xu
- **Abstract**: The rise of (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) has shed light on software agent -- where software can understand and follow user instructions in natural language. However, existing approaches such as API-based and GUI-based agents are far from satisfactory at accuracy and efficiency aspects. Instead, we advocate to endow LLMs with access to the software internals (source code and runtime context) and the permission to dynamically inject generated code into software for execution. In such a whitebox setting, one may better leverage the software context and the coding ability of LLMs. We then present an overall design architecture and case studies on two popular web-based desktop applications. We also give in-depth discussion of the challenges and future directions. We deem that such a new paradigm has the potential to fundamentally overturn the existing software agent design, and finally creating a digital world in which software can comprehend, operate, collaborate, and even think to meet complex user needs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Every Software as an Agent: Blueprint and Case Study" posits that existing software agents, particularly those utilizing large language models (LLMs), are inadequate in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The authors propose a novel approach that allows LLMs access to software internals—such as source code and runtime context—and the ability to dynamically inject and execute generated code. This "whitebox" approach aims to enhance the ability of LLMs to leverage the context of the software while utilizing their coding capabilities.

- **Authors**: Jungwoo Kim, Minsang Kim, Sungjin Lee
- **Abstract**: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the industry to develop various AI-based services. Instruction tuning is considered essential in adapting foundation models for target domains to provide high-quality services to customers. A key challenge in instruction tuning is obtaining high-quality instruction data. Self-Instruct, which automatically generates instruction data using ChatGPT APIs, alleviates the data scarcity problem. To improve the quality of instruction data, Self-Instruct discards many of the instructions generated from ChatGPT, even though it is inefficient in terms of cost owing to many useless API calls. To generate high-quality instruction data at a low cost, we propose a novel data generation framework, Self-Direct Instruction generation (SeDi-Instruct), which employs diversity-based filtering and iterative feedback task generation. Diversity-based filtering maintains model accuracy without excessively discarding low-quality generated instructions by enhancing the diversity of instructions in a batch. This reduces the cost of synthesizing instruction data. The iterative feedback task generation integrates instruction generation and training tasks and utilizes information obtained during the training to create high-quality instruction sets. Our results show that SeDi-Instruct enhances the accuracy of AI models by 5.2%, compared with traditional methods, while reducing data generation costs by 36%.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces SeDi-Instruct, a novel framework designed to improve the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) through enhanced self-directed instruction generation. Building on previous work with Self-Instruct, which utilized ChatGPT APIs for creating instructional data, SeDi-Instruct addresses critical issues related to the quality and cost-effectiveness of instruction data generation. The proposed framework employs diversity-based filtering to preserve model accuracy while minimizing the discarding of low-quality instructions. Additionally, iterative feedback task generation is integrated into the process to use insights from the instruction generation phase to produce superior instruction sets. The results indicate that SeDi-Instruct improves model accuracy by 5.2% compared to conventional methods and reduces data generation costs by 36%. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  The paper presents a novel approach by combining diversity-based filtering and iterative feedback mechanisms for generating instructional data efficiently. While the concept of self-directed instruction is significant and extends the existing Self-Instruct methodology, the novelty lies primarily in the new filtering and feedback processes rather than groundbreaking theoretical advancements in instruction generation. **Significance:** The framework has practical implications, particularly regarding cost efficiency and the capacity to produce quality instructional data that adapts to specific domain requirements. This addresses significant challenges in the realm of instruction tuning for LLMs, which can enhance the deployment of AI services across various sectors. Moreover, the tangible improvements in accuracy and reduced costs are likely to impact practitioners in AI development, supporting wider accessibility to high-quality LLM training resources. **Strengths:** - Empirical results demonstrate both accuracy improvement and cost reductions, which are crucial in practical applications. - The integration of diversity-based approaches helps maintain model performance while potentially mitigating overfitting to specific types of instruction. - The iterative feedback mechanism is a commendable effort to create a feedback loop where the data generation process benefits from past training insights. **Weaknesses:** - The reliance on APIs, such as ChatGPT, may raise questions about scalability and dependency on external technologies. - The paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of potential limitations or biases introduced by the instruction generation process. - Further comparative analysis with existing frameworks could strengthen the validation of SeDi-Instruct's effectiveness. In conclusion, while SeDi-Instruct provides an innovative approach to instructional data generation for LLMs, its novelty and overall impact may not be as profound when compared to earlier breakthroughs in the field. However, it represents a valuable step forward in optimizing the training processes for AI models. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with practical implications but acknowledges some limitations in novelty and the need for further validation and broader contextual analysis.

- **Authors**: Chen-Xiao Gao, Chenyang Wu, Mingjun Cao, Chenjun Xiao, Yang Yu, Zongzhang Zhang
- **Abstract**: The primary focus of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to manage the risk of hazardous exploitation of out-of-distribution actions. An effective approach to achieve this goal is through behavior regularization, which augments conventional RL objectives by incorporating constraints that enforce the policy to remain close to the behavior policy. Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Behavior-Regularized Diffusion Policy Optimization for Offline Reinforcement Learning" addresses the challenge of ensuring safe exploration in offline reinforcement learning (RL) by proposing a novel framework named BDPO. The key focus is on integrating behavior regularization, which traditionally maintains policy proximity to existing behavior policies to prevent out-of-distribution actions, with diffusion-based policy representations. The authors present a methodology for calculating Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization using reverse-time transition kernels across diffusion trajectories. They develop an actor-critic RL algorithm that operates on two timescales, ensuring the learned policy adheres to the behavior constraints. Their experiments on a range of 2D and continuous control tasks demonstrate the method's effectiveness and improved performance compared to existing approaches. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The introduction of BDPO as a behavior-regularized framework specifically designed for diffusion policies represents an essential advancement in the application of offline RL. Previous research generally centered on traditional policy parameterizations, which limited the exploration of newer models like diffusion processes. By bridging this gap and innovating in the area of policy representation, the authors provide useful insights into policy design and safety mechanisms in RL. **Significance:** The potential impact of this work is notable. The method aims to increase safety and reduce the risks associated with out-of-distribution actions, a pressing concern in real-world applications of RL. The integration of KL regularization within the context of diffusion models could lead to higher robustness in policy performance. Additionally, the proposed two-time-scale actor-critic algorithm may pave the way for more efficient training methods in RL. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The work applies contemporary diffusion models to offline RL, an area not extensively explored previously. 2. **Analytical KL Regularization:** The approach offers a systematic way to handle regularization, contributing to the methodological richness of RL. 3. **Empirical Validation:** Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across varied tasks, strengthening the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the experiments demonstrate solid performance, it's unclear how well BDPO scales to more complex, high-dimensional environments beyond those tested. 2. **Computational Complexity:** The two-time-scale approach may introduce additional computational overhead, whose practical implications should be explored in greater detail. 3. **Comparison with Other Approaches:** Although the paper claims superior performance, a more extensive comparison with a broader set of state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the claims of effectiveness and innovation. Given the above evaluation, the paper demonstrates a strong contribution to the field of offline reinforcement learning through its novel framework that successfully integrates behavior regularization with advanced policy representation. However, additional work is needed to address scalability and computational complexity concerns, alongside deeper comparative analyses to validate its competitive edge against a wider array of methods. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant novelty and potential impact while acknowledging areas that could benefit from further exploration and clarity.

- **Authors**: Wanjia Zhao, Mert Yuksekgonul, Shirley Wu, James Zou
- **Abstract**: Multi-agent AI systems powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to solve complex tasks. However, these systems often rely on fragile, manually designed prompts and heuristics, making optimization difficult. A key challenge in optimizing multi-agent systems is acquiring suitable training data for specialized agents. We introduce SiriuS, a self-improving, reasoning-driven optimization framework for multi-agent systems. Central to our approach is the construction of an experience library: a repository of high-quality reasoning trajectories. The library is built by retaining reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes, providing a robust training set for optimizing multi-agent system. Additionally, we introduce a library augmentation procedure that refines unsuccessful trajectories, further enriching the library. SiriuS boosts performance by 2.86\% to 21.88\% on reasoning and biomedical QA and enhances agent negotiation in competitive settings. Our results show that SiriuS enhances multi-agent performance while generating reusable data for self-correction and self-play enhancement in the future.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents SiriuS, a novel framework aimed at improving multi-agent systems that utilize large language models (LLMs) through a self-improving, reasoning-driven approach. The primary challenge addressed is the optimization of these systems, which typically depends on fragile prompts and heuristics, which are difficult to modify. The authors propose the creation of an "experience library," a repository of effective reasoning trajectories built by retaining the reasoning steps that lead to successful outcomes. This library serves as a valuable training dataset for fine-tuning agents within these systems. The authors also introduce a library augmentation process that enhances unsuccessful trajectories, contributing to an enriched experience library. Empirical results demonstrate that SiriuS significantly boosts performance across various domains (2.86% to 21.88% improvements in reasoning and biomedical question answering), while also fostering better negotiation strategies among agents. Overall, the framework not only enhances current performance but also enables the generation of reusable data for future self-improvement and self-play applications. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The idea of using a self-improving framework built around an experience library is innovative. Traditional methods often do not effectively utilize previous reasoning successes and fail to address how learning can be efficiently optimized in multi-agent contexts. The emphasis on both retention of successful trajectories and augmentation of unsuccessful ones is a fresh perspective that could reshape methodologies in the field. **Significance:** Given the increasing reliance on multi-agent systems in complex problem-solving scenarios and the growing application of LLMs, SiriuS holds significant potential. Performance improvements of nearly 22% in critical areas could have substantial implications for real-world applications. Furthermore, the framework's ability to generate reusable data for self-correction contributes to sustainability in training models. **Strengths:**  - The paper addresses a pressing issue in multi-agent systems about the fragility of prompt designs and the quality of training data. - Strong empirical results underpin the proposed framework, indicating tangible improvements in target performance metrics. - The methods introduced promote scalability and adaptability, which are crucial for ongoing advancements in AI systems. **Weaknesses:**  - The paper could benefit from deeper discussion on the scalability of the experience library and the potential limitations of the reasoning trajectories. - A more robust comparison against existing state-of-the-art optimization frameworks could provide a clearer picture of the incremental contribution of SiriuS. - Future work could explore the broader applicability of this framework across various multi-agent environments beyond the tested domains. **Potential Influence:** The introduction of SiriuS could pave the way for more resilient and adaptive multi-agent systems. However, its influence will depend largely on subsequent validation in diverse problem domains and the community's adoption of these strategies. Ultimately, SiriuS offers a promising route toward enhancing the efficiency and robustness of multi-agent AI, meriting further investigation and application. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with innovative methodologies and significant empirical results.

### Probing Internal Representations of Multi-Word Verbs in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04789v1)
- **Authors**: Hassane Kissane, Achim Schilling, Patrick Krauss
- **Abstract**: This study investigates the internal representations of verb-particle combinations, called multi-word verbs, within transformer-based large language models (LLMs), specifically examining how these models capture lexical and syntactic properties at different neural network layers. Using the BERT architecture, we analyze the representations of its layers for two different verb-particle constructions: phrasal verbs like 'give up' and prepositional verbs like 'look at'. Our methodology includes training probing classifiers on the internal representations to classify these categories at both word and sentence levels. The results indicate that the model's middle layers achieve the highest classification accuracies. To further analyze the nature of these distinctions, we conduct a data separability test using the Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV). While GDV results show weak linear separability between the two verb types, probing classifiers still achieve high accuracy, suggesting that representations of these linguistic categories may be non-linearly separable. This aligns with previous research indicating that linguistic distinctions in neural networks are not always encoded in a linearly separable manner. These findings computationally support usage-based claims on the representation of verb-particle constructions and highlight the complex interaction between neural network architectures and linguistic structures.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Probing Internal Representations of Multi-Word Verbs in Large Language Models" investigates how transformer-based large language models (LLMs), especially BERT, represent multi-word verbs—specifically phrasal verbs like 'give up' and prepositional verbs like 'look at'. The authors analyze different layers of the model to understand how lexical and syntactic properties are captured. They train probing classifiers to distinguish between these verb types at both the word and sentence levels, finding that middle layers yield the highest classification accuracy. Although their analysis using Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV) indicates weak linear separability between constructions, the classifiers still demonstrate strong performance, pointing to potentially non-linear separability. The study provides computational evidence supporting usage-based theories of language representation, emphasizing the complexity of how neural architectures interact with linguistic structures. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance** This paper addresses a relatively underexplored area in natural language processing, focusing specifically on how LLMs encode complex linguistic structures like multi-word verbs. Previous studies have often concentrated on single-word representations or simpler constructions, making this investigation into the intricacies of multi-word verbs significant. By using BERT to explore the properties of these constructions at different layers, the authors offer meaningful insights into the internal workings of LLMs, particularly concerning the distinction and representation of linguistic forms. **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of probing classifiers provides a systematic approach to examine how different layers of BERT encode linguistic information. This lends credibility to the results and conclusions drawn. 2. **Focus on Non-Linearity:** Addressing the non-linear nature of linguistic distinctions aligns with contemporary understandings in computational linguistics and supports the complexity of language representation. 3. **Theoretical Contribution:** By linking findings to usage-based theories of language, the study broadens its impact beyond purely computational findings, contributing to linguistic theory discussions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While focusing on phrasal and prepositional verbs is intriguing, the analysis could be broadened to include a wider range of multi-word verb constructions. This limitation raises questions about the generalizability of the findings. 2. **GDV Interpretation:** The weak linear separability implied by GDV results could have been explored further, since it raises questions about the underlying structures in the representations that hinder clearer classification. 3. **Model Dependency:** The findings are tied closely to the BERT architecture. While BERT is influential, it may limit the implications for other architectures or systems used in NLP. **Overall Assessment:** Given the methodological advancements and the theoretical implications, this paper represents a significant contribution to both the fields of NLP and linguistics. However, the narrow focus on two types of verb constructions and the implications of the results suggest moderate novelty.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution that provides new insights into LLMs, albeit with some limitations in scope and depth that prevent it from being a groundbreaking entry in the field. The findings could inspire future research directions, especially if the framework used were applied to a broader set of linguistic phenomena.

- **Authors**: Yuting Zeng, Weizhe Huang, Lei Jiang, Tongxuan Liu, Xitai Jin, Chen Tianying Tiana, Jing Li, Xiaohua Xu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing (NLP) scenarios, but they still face challenges when handling complex arithmetic and logical reasoning tasks. While Chain-Of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, self-consistency (SC) and self-correction strategies have attempted to guide models in sequential, multi-step reasoning, Multi-agent Debate (MAD) has emerged as a viable approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By increasing both the number of agents and the frequency of debates, the performance of LLMs improves significantly. However, this strategy results in a significant increase in token costs, presenting a barrier to scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel sparsification strategy designed to reduce token costs within MAD. This approach minimizes ineffective exchanges of information and unproductive discussions among agents, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the debate process. We conduct comparative experiments on multiple datasets across various models, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces the token costs in MAD to a considerable extent. Specifically, compared to MAD, our approach achieves an impressive reduction of up to 94.5\% in token costs while maintaining performance degradation below 2.0\%.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "S$^2$-MAD: Breaking the Token Barrier to Enhance Multi-Agent Debate Efficiency" addresses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks. While previous methods like Chain-Of-Thought and self-consistency attempts have been employed to enhance reasoning capabilities, Multi-agent Debate (MAD) shows promise by leveraging the competition between agents to improve outcomes. However, employing MAD leads to high token costs, which hampers scalability. To tackle this issue, the authors propose a new sparsification strategy that reduces the token costs effectively by minimizing redundant communications and unproductive exchanges among the debating agents. Their experiments across various datasets and models demonstrate that this new method can reduce MAD's token costs by up to 94.5%, while limiting performance degradation to less than 2.0%. ### Critical Evaluation of the Paper's Novelty and Significance **Strengths:**   1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a sparsification strategy in MAD is a critical advancement, addressing a notable limitation in scalability that has compromised the practical application of multi-agent frameworks in LLMs. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors have conducted extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness of their method, which strengthens the credibility of their findings. 3. **Performance Metrics:** Achieving a significant token cost reduction while preserving performance is a notable contribution, as it addresses one of the prevalent challenges in scaling LLM applications. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Generalizability:** The specific methodologies and datasets used for testing may limit the generalizability of the results. The performance improvement might not hold across all LLMs or in various real-world scenarios. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** While the reductions in token costs are impressive, the effectiveness of MAD relative to other contemporary methodologies isn't deeply explored, which makes it difficult to assess its comparative value or potential drawbacks against other approaches. 3. **Theoretical Framework:** The paper lacks a robust theoretical underpinning that explains why the proposed strategy works. A deeper inquiry into the aspects of agent communication dynamics could provide clearer insights into the observed improvements in efficiency. **Potential Influence:**   The research has the potential to significantly impact the field of NLP by providing a scalable solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. If the method proves adaptable and effective in wider contexts, it could fundamentally change how multi-agent systems are integrated into real-world applications. However, further exploration into the broader applicability and theoretical foundations is necessary for sustained influence. **Conclusion:**   Overall, the contribution of the paper is substantial, addressing both a technical challenge and presenting a viable solution backed by empirical data. Although it has some limitations, particularly concerning generalizability and theoretical insights, the advancements proposed are certainly valuable in the context of LLM efficiency. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's solid innovative contribution to the field while acknowledging the need for further validation and exploration of the proposed methods.

- **Abstract**: Large language models exhibit general linguistic abilities but significantly differ from humans in their efficiency of language acquisition. This study proposes a method for integrating the developmental characteristics of working memory during the critical period, a stage when human language acquisition is particularly efficient, into language models. The proposed method introduces a mechanism that initially constrains working memory during the early stages of training and gradually relaxes this constraint in an exponential manner as learning progresses. Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional models without memory constraints or with static memory constraints. These findings not only provide new directions for designing data-efficient language models but also offer indirect evidence supporting the underlying mechanisms of the critical period hypothesis in human language acquisition.

The findings provide insights into the design of more data-efficient language models and support the critical period hypothesis in language acquisition. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its innovative approach to integrating developmental aspects of working memory into language model training. Many existing models tend to overlook the intricate relationship between cognitive development and language learning, making this contribution relevant and timely. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The introduction of a dynamic working memory constraint during training offers a fresh perspective that could lead to more effective models, leveraging principles drawn from human cognitive development. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide clear empirical data showing improved syntactic performance, establishing a solid foundation for their claims. 3. **Theoretical Implications:** By linking their findings to the critical period hypothesis, the paper provides a broader context that may stimulate further research in both computational linguistics and cognitive science.

- **Authors**: Yifeng Yu, Lu Yu
- **Abstract**: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in generative modeling, yet their theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we focus on the Wasserstein convergence analysis of score-based diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the impact of various discretization schemes, including Euler discretization, exponential integrators, and midpoint randomization methods. Our analysis provides a quantitative comparison of these discrete approximations, emphasizing their influence on convergence behavior. Furthermore, we explore scenarios where Hessian information is available and propose an accelerated sampler based on the local linearization method. We demonstrate that this Hessian-based approach achieves faster convergence rates of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ significantly improving upon the standard rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ of vanilla diffusion models, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy.

The authors analyze different discretization methods, such as Euler discretization, exponential integrators, and midpoint randomization, and provide a quantitative comparison of these approaches. The study highlights how the choice of discretization impacts convergence rates. Additionally, they introduce an accelerated sampler utilizing Hessian information, which enhances convergence rates to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ compared to the traditional $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ of standard diffusion models.

- **Authors**: Jaiden Fairoze, Guillermo Ortiz-Jiménez, Mel Vecerik, Somesh Jha, Sven Gowal
- **Abstract**: This work investigates the theoretical boundaries of creating publicly-detectable schemes to enable the provenance of watermarked imagery. Metadata-based approaches like C2PA provide unforgeability and public-detectability. ML techniques offer robust retrieval and watermarking. However, no existing scheme combines robustness, unforgeability, and public-detectability. In this work, we formally define such a scheme and establish its existence. Although theoretically possible, we find that at present, it is intractable to build certain components of our scheme without a leap in deep learning capabilities. We analyze these limitations and propose research directions that need to be addressed before we can practically realize robust and publicly-verifiable provenance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "On the Difficulty of Constructing a Robust and Publicly-Detectable Watermark" explores the challenges involved in creating watermarking schemes that are robust, unforgeable, and publicly detectable. It highlights existing approaches, such as metadata-based systems (like C2PA) and machine learning techniques, which successfully address parts of these requirements but fail to integrate all three needed characteristics. The authors define a theoretical framework for such a watermarking scheme and discuss its feasibility at a theoretical level, indicating that current technologies are insufficient for practical implementation. They identify key limitations in existing methods and propose future research avenues necessary to overcome the hurdles associated with creating effective watermarking techniques capable of ensuring the provenance of watermarked images. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Originality of Concept**: The paper tackles an important and timely issue in the realm of digital forensics, content verification, and copyright protection. The integration of robustness, unforgeability, and public-detectability in watermarking is a complex problem that has seen insufficient exploration, making their study novel. 2. **Theoretical Contributions**: By formally defining a scheme for watermarking that incorporates all three attributes, the authors contribute a useful theoretical foundation that could guide future engineering efforts. This is a significant step as it not only outlines the challenges but provides a framework that researchers can build upon. 3. **Identification of Limitations**: The authors successfully articulate current limitations of existing technologies and emphasize the need for advances in deep learning to make their conceptual scheme practical. This level of critical analysis shows a mature understanding of the field’s dynamics and sets a stage for necessary future inquiries. **Potential Weaknesses**: 1. **Intractability Assertion**: While the authors note that the practical implementation of their scheme is intractable with current methods, they do not provide detailed insights into potential paths or methodologies that could address identified limitations. It lacks actionable steps that could be taken to move the field forward. 2. **Scope of Research Directions**: The proposed directions for future research seem broad and vague. More specific guidance on potential advancements or experimental frameworks would have enhanced the impact of their suggestions. 3. **Early Stage of Research**: Although the theoretical framework is established, establishing its viability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios has not been explored, which might limit immediate applicability and interest from industry stakeholders. **Overall Assessment**: Given its originality in addressing a complex multi-faceted problem and its theoretical contributions, the paper makes a notable contribution, albeit with recognized limitations. The lack of immediate applicability and the need for substantial advances in technology before turning theory into practice detract slightly from its overall impact. **Score**: 7

### Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v1)
- **Authors**: Romina Etezadi, Sallam Abualhaija, Chetan Arora, Lionel Briand
- **Abstract**: New regulations are continuously introduced to ensure that software development complies with the ethical concerns and prioritizes public safety. A prerequisite for demonstrating compliance involves tracing software requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a fundamental task where requirements engineers are supposed to analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often under limited time budget. Doing this analysis manually for complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension introduces additional challenges that only exacerbate manual effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on large language models (LLMs) to predict trace links between requirements and legal provisions. The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers. The second solution prompts a recent generative LLM based on Rice, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against a baseline classifier from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with an average recall of ~67%, outperforming the baseline with a substantial gain of 54 percentage points (pp) in recall. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European general data protection regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%. On the same documents, however, our Rice-based solution yields an average recall of 84%, with a remarkable gain of about 69 pp over Kashif. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the challenges of software requirements traceability to legal provisions in the context of evolving regulations that prioritize public safety. It assesses two automated solutions utilizing large language models (LLMs) for predicting trace links between technical requirements and legal provisions. The first method, Kashif, employs sentence transformers as a classifier, while the second method utilizes a prompt engineering framework called Rice with a generative LLM. Empirical evaluations on a benchmark dataset show that Kashif achieves an average recall of ~67%, significantly outperforming a baseline classifier from existing literature. However, it struggles with unseen complex requirements, notably those related to the European GDPR, where it drops to 15% recall. In contrast, the Rice-based solution excels with an average recall of 84%, highlighting the limitations of traditional classifiers in complex legal contexts. The findings suggest that generative LLMs with effective prompt engineering are more suited for this nuanced task. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative analysis of two distinct approaches for a pressing issue in software compliance and legal requirements traceability. The focus on utilizing LLMs, particularly through prompt engineering, represents a significant advancement over traditional classification methods, underscoring the limitations of conventional machine learning techniques in addressing complex regulatory frameworks. **Strengths:** - The paper presents empirical results demonstrating clear performance differences between the classifier and generative model, providing tangible evidence for the argument that legal traceability requires nuanced solutions. - It contributes valuable insights to the fields of software engineering and compliance, particularly in the context of increasing legal scrutiny of software systems. - The experimentation with different methodologies reflects a comprehensive approach to understanding the problem space. **Weaknesses:** - While the study provides strong initial results for the Rice framework, it lacks extensive exploration of the potential challenges and limitations associated with generative LLMs, such as biases in model training or difficulties in generalizing across different legal provisions. - Additionally, the dataset used for testing, while mentioned, could be more clearly described to assess its adequacy for broader generalizations. - The authors could further discuss the applicability of their findings beyond the GDPR, considering variations in legal systems globally. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of software requirements compliance with a clear demonstration of the advantages of generative approaches over traditional classification methods. The findings have crucial implications for the future of automated legal compliance in software engineering, making it a noteworthy addition to the literature. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial insights and innovative contributions while also acknowledging some shortcomings that could be addressed in future research. The results advocate for a paradigm shift in addressing legal requirements traceability, which is increasingly relevant in today’s computational landscape.

### Cached Multi-Lora Composition for Multi-Concept Image Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04923v1)
- **Authors**: Xiandong Zou, Mingzhu Shen, Christos-Savvas Bouganis, Yiren Zhao
- **Abstract**: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely adopted technique in text-to-image models, enabling precise rendering of multiple distinct elements, such as characters and styles, in multi-concept image generation. However, current approaches face significant challenges when composing these LoRAs for multi-concept image generation, resulting in diminished generated image quality. In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the denoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on the hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to "semantic conflicts", we find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and textures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the overall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we devise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal order in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy offers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive integration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully leverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA composition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while maintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for multi-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual LoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA composition and improve computational efficiency. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMLoRA outperforms state-of-the-art training-free LoRA fusion methods by a significant margin -- it achieves an average improvement of $2.19\%$ in CLIPScore, and $11.25\%$ in MLLM win rate compared to LoraHub, LoRA Composite, and LoRA Switch.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Cached Multi-Lora Composition for Multi-Concept Image Generation" addresses the challenges encountered in combining multiple Low-Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) in multi-concept text-to-image generation, which can result in reduced image quality due to "semantic conflicts." The authors analyze LoRAs through the Fourier frequency domain and find that different LoRAs impact high and low-frequency features differently, leading to potential issues when integrated naively. To overcome this, they propose a frequency domain-based sequencing strategy for integrating LoRAs, which promises a more systematic approach to the composition process. Additionally, they introduce a framework named Cached Multi-LoRA (CMLoRA), which is designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while reducing semantic conflicts and enhancing computational efficiency. Experimental results show that CMLoRA outperforms existing training-free LoRA fusion methods, demonstrating significant improvements in CLIPScore and MLLM win rate. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of the Fourier frequency domain to analyze LoRA integration is a novel perspective that sheds light on the specific problems associated with multi-concept image generation, particularly semantic conflicts. 2. **Practical Framework:** The proposed CMLoRA framework is designed as a training-free method, making it more accessible for a wider audience who may not have resources for extensive model retraining. 3. **Performance Gains:** The experimental results showing substantial improvements over existing methods strengthen the paper’s contributions, indicating a practical advancement in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the paper highlights improvements in specific metrics (CLIPScore, MLLM win rate), it lacks a broader evaluation of the qualitative differences in the generated images or user studies to assess real-world effectiveness. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** The method's reliance on the frequency domain might be less applicable to other architectures or types of image generation tasks, limiting its universal applicability. 3. **Detailed Comparison:** The paper could benefit from more extensive comparisons to other potential methods of addressing semantic conflicts, not just existing LoRA fusion techniques. **Overall Significance:** The research provides a meaningful contribution to the area of text-to-image synthesis and proposes a novel solution to a recognized problem in multi-concept image generation. The insights provided through the frequency analysis and the introduction of CMLoRA mark important steps forward, particularly in terms of usability and efficiency. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a significant but not revolutionary contribution. The paper presents an interesting framework with tangible improvements but could benefit from broader applicability and qualitative assessments. The advancements in efficiency and performance establish its relevance but fall short of an exceptional breakthrough that would warrant a higher score.

- **Abstract**: Conventional 5G network management mechanisms, that operate in isolated silos across different network segments, will experience significant limitations in handling the unprecedented hyper-complexity and massive scale of the sixth generation (6G). Holistic intelligence and end-to-end automation are, thus, positioned as key enablers of forthcoming 6G networks. The Large Language Model (LLM) technology, a major breakthrough in the Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) field, enjoys robust human-like language processing, advanced contextual reasoning and multi-modal capabilities. These features foster a holistic understanding of network behavior and an autonomous decision-making. This paper investigates four possible architectural designs for integrated LLM and 6G networks, detailing the inherent technical intricacies, the merits and the limitations of each design. As an internal functional building block of future 6G networks, the LLM will natively benefit from their improved design-driven security policies from the early design and specification stages. An illustrative scenario of slicing conflicts is used to prove the effectiveness of our architectural framework in autonomously dealing with complicated network anomalies. We finally conclude the paper with an overview of the key challenges and the relevant research trends for enabling Mobile Networkspecialized LLMs. This study is intended to provide Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) with a comprehensive guidance in their paths towards embracing the LLM technology.

The authors explore four potential architectural frameworks integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into 6G networks, assessing their technical intricacies, benefits, and drawbacks. The paper presents a case study on slicing conflicts to illustrate the proposed architectures' ability to handle complex network anomalies autonomously. The discussion concludes with an outline of key challenges and research trends relevant to mobile network-specialized LLMs, offering guidance to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) on effectively incorporating LLM technology into their networks. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**: 1. **Innovative Use of LLMs**: The introduction of LLMs to mobile network management represents a significant novelty, as traditional systems tend to operate in silos and lack the advanced contextual reasoning essential for 6G. This novel integration could lead to more efficient, adaptive network management solutions. 2. **Architectural Frameworks**: By proposing four specific architectural designs, the paper contributes to an emerging field that has yet to establish standardized practices for integrating advanced AI with telecommunications networks. This can stimulate further research and discussion around optimized network designs. 3. **Case Study on Slicing Conflicts**: The use of a practical scenario to validate the proposed solutions enhances the paper’s relevance, providing tangible applications of theory to real-world issues faced by network operators. **Strengths**: - **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper thoroughly discusses technical intricacies and the implications of different models, showcasing a deep understanding of both telecommunications and AI. - **Timely Focus**: As the shift from 5G to 6G begins, this research is timely and addresses pressing challenges that will influence the future of network management. - **Guidance for MNOs**: The practical insights provided can aid MNOs in strategic planning and decision-making regarding the adoption of LLM technologies. **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Empirical Data**: While the architectural designs and case study are valuable, the analysis would benefit from empirical results that validate the performance of these LLM-integrated networks under real-world conditions. - **Scope of Challenges**: The paper briefly mentions challenges without deeply analyzing each one. A more comprehensive discussion of potential obstacles, limitations, and strategies to overcome them could enhance its impact. - **Broader Context**: The paper might benefit from situating itself within a wider context of AI advancements beyond LLMs, such as reinforcement learning and network optimization techniques. **Score Justification**: Overall, the paper offers significant insights and proposes innovative frameworks for integrating LLMs into 6G networks, which is a novel area of research with vast implications. However, the lack of empirical validation and a more in-depth treatment of challenges constrains its immediacy and practical applicability in the field. Therefore, while the contributions are noteworthy and provide a solid foundation for future research, the paper does not fully leverage the potential of its findings. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Zeren Luo, Zifan Peng, Yule Liu, Zhen Sun, Mingchen Li, Jingyi Zheng, Xinlei He
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs), offering precise and efficient responses by integrating external databases with pre-existing knowledge. However, we observe that these AIPSEs raise risks such as quoting malicious content or citing malicious websites, leading to harmful or unverified information dissemination. In this study, we conduct the first safety risk quantification on seven production AIPSEs by systematically defining the threat model, risk level, and evaluating responses to various query types. With data collected from PhishTank, ThreatBook, and LevelBlue, our findings reveal that AIPSEs frequently generate harmful content that contains malicious URLs even with benign queries (e.g., with benign keywords). We also observe that directly query URL will increase the risk level while query with natural language will mitigate such risk. We further perform two case studies on online document spoofing and phishing to show the ease of deceiving AIPSEs in the real-world setting. To mitigate these risks, we develop an agent-based defense with a GPT-4o-based content refinement tool and an XGBoost-based URL detector. Our evaluation shows that our defense can effectively reduce the risk but with the cost of reducing available information. Our research highlights the urgent need for robust safety measures in AIPSEs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the heightened risks associated with AI-Powered Search Engines (AIPSEs) due to significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs). While these models improve search functionalities through enhanced response accuracy, they also propagate threats such as disseminating malicious content via harmful URLs. The authors conduct a comprehensive risk assessment of seven existing AIPSEs, categorizing threats, evaluating responses, and analyzing data from sources like PhishTank and ThreatBook. Findings indicate that AIPSEs often return harmful responses even when queried with benign terms, highlighting variations in risk based on query structure. Additionally, the authors demonstrate practical vulnerabilities through case studies on online document spoofing and phishing. To address these issues, the study proposes an agent-based defense mechanism combining a content refinement tool and a URL detector, effectively reducing risks but potentially compromising information accessibility. The overall aim emphasizes the critical need for enhanced safety measures for AIPSEs in light of their evolving capabilities. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents a novel contribution by systematically quantifying safety risks associated with AIPSEs, a relatively under-explored area in AI and cybersecurity literature. While there exists prior work on LLMs and their biases or vulnerabilities, the specific focus on their application in search engine technology—particularly relating to real-world security threats—is timely and relevant given the rapid adoption of AI in information retrieval systems. **Strengths:** 1. **Pioneering Risk Assessment:** The paper performs an original risk quantification analysis, setting a foundational framework for future studies. 2. **Real-World Case Studies:** By including practical examples such as phishing and document spoofing, the paper grounds its findings in actual security concerns that practitioners face today. 3. **Proposed Mitigation Strategy:** The introduction of an agent-based defense tool illustrates a proactive approach to address the highlighted issues, encouraging further exploration of AI safety measures. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Narrow Scope of Analysis:** The focus is primarily limited to seven AIPSEs, which may not represent the entire landscape of AI-powered search technologies. Broader engagement could yield more generalized conclusions. 2. **Trade-off Presentation:** The acknowledgment of a reduction in available information as a cost of safety measures is concerning. A deeper exploration of this trade-off and how it affects user experience would strengthen the discussion. 3. **Lack of Longitudinal Data:** The study does not consider the ongoing evolution of these models, which may change the nature of risks over time. Analyzing the effects of model updates could provide more insight. **Influence on the Field:** The research underscores a critical need for dedicated safety protocols in the design and deployment of AIPSEs, which resonates well with ongoing discussions about AI ethics and security. It has the potential to influence both academic inquiry and practical measures within the tech industry, emphasizing the balance between utility and safety in AI applications. Given these considerations, I assign the paper a score of **8**. The contribution is significant in advancing our understanding of risks associated with AIPSEs and proposes practical solutions, yet the limitations regarding scope and depth of analysis prevent it from being classified as an exceptional contribution.  **Score: 8**

### CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04964v1)
- **Authors**: Roman Vashurin, Maiya Goloburda, Preslav Nakov, Artem Shelmanov, Maxim Panov
- **Abstract**: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) encompasses a variety of approaches, with two major types being particularly prominent: information-based, which focus on model confidence expressed as token probabilities, and consistency-based, which assess the semantic relationship between multiple outputs generated using repeated sampling. Several recent methods have combined these two approaches and shown impressive performance in various applications. However, they sometimes fail to outperform much simpler baseline methods. Our investigation reveals distinctive characteristics of LLMs as probabilistic models, which help to explain why these UQ methods underperform in certain tasks. Based on these findings, we propose a new way of synthesizing model confidence and output consistency that leads to a family of efficient and robust UQ methods. We evaluate our approach across a variety of tasks such as question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating sizable improvements over state-of-the-art UQ approaches.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "CoCoA: A Generalized Approach to Uncertainty Quantification by Integrating Confidence and Consistency of LLM Outputs" addresses the problem of uncertainty quantification (UQ) in Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights two primary UQ methodologies: information-based methods that determine model confidence through token probabilities, and consistency-based methods that evaluate the coherence among multiple outputs generated from repeated sampling. Although existing approaches that merge these strategies have shown commendable results, the authors argue that they sometimes lag behind simpler baseline techniques. Their investigations into LLMs as probabilistic models uncover underlying characteristics that contribute to the underperformance of conventional UQ methods. Consequently, the authors propose a novel synthesis of model confidence and output consistency, resulting in a suite of efficient and robust UQ strategies. The effectiveness of their methods is validated across diverse tasks including question answering, abstractive summarization, and machine translation, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art techniques. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of uncertainty quantification in LLMs by proposing a novel framework that integrates the strengths of both confidence-based and consistency-based methodologies. The insight that existing approaches may fail due to the probabilistic nature of LLMs is a critical one, as it provides a theoretical grounding for the development of more effective strategies. This synthesis approach is plausible and offers a fresh perspective on the existing dichotomy in UQ methods, suggesting that a combined approach may lead to better results. However, the paper could be criticized for not providing a thorough exploration of the limitations of existing methods before presenting its own. While the proposed methods show promise, the evaluation might lack detailed analysis regarding their computational efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios, which are crucial factors for wider adoption in industry applications. The applications tested, although diverse, are somewhat conventional, and the paper could benefit from demonstrating the applicability of its methods to more complex or novel tasks. Regarding its influence on the field, the integration of confidence and consistency in UQ opens avenues for further research, but the extent to which it materially advances the state-of-the-art will depend on subsequent validations and comparisons in various contexts beyond those covered in the paper. **Rationale for the Score:** Taking into account the strengths of the proposed methodology, the critical insights into LLMs, and the improvement demonstrated over existing methods, I assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a strong contribution that introduces valuable perspectives on uncertainty in LLMs, while acknowledging that there is room for deeper exploration and broader applicability. The groundwork laid by this paper presents a significant step in the discourse on uncertainty quantification, though further validation is necessary to establish its lasting impact on the field. **Score: 7**

### Enhancing Pre-Trained Decision Transformers with Prompt-Tuning Bandits
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04979v1)
- **Authors**: Finn Rietz, Oleg Smirnov, Sara Karimi, Lele Cao
- **Abstract**: Harnessing large offline datasets is vital for training foundation models that can generalize across diverse tasks. Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful framework for these scenarios, enabling the derivation of optimal policies even from suboptimal data. The Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT) is an offline RL multi-task model that distinguishes tasks through stochastic trajectory prompts, which are task-specific tokens maintained in context during rollouts. However, PDT samples these tokens uniformly at random from per-task demonstration datasets, failing to account for differences in token informativeness and potentially leading to performance degradation. To address this limitation, we introduce a scalable bandit-based prompt-tuning method that dynamically learns to construct high-performance trajectory prompts. Our approach significantly enhances downstream task performance without modifying the pre-trained Transformer backbone. Empirical results on benchmark tasks and a newly designed multi-task environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, creating a seamless bridge between general multi-task offline pre-training and task-specific online adaptation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel method called Prompting Decision Transformer (PDT), which enhances offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) by incorporating task-specific trajectory prompts that allow for more effective generalization across different tasks. The authors identify a key limitation in the existing approach: the uniform random sampling of these prompts from per-task datasets, thereby neglecting the varying informativeness of tokens. To rectify this, they propose a bandit-based prompt-tuning method that adaptively learns to select high-performance prompts for multiple tasks. This approach does not alter the foundational Transformer model, thus maintaining compatibility while improving task performance. Empirical evidence from benchmark tasks and a new multi-task environment supports the effectiveness of this method. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies in its combination of two significant concepts: the use of an offline RL framework and the introduction of a bandit-based mechanism for prompt selection in the context of the PDT. Many existing studies in the field focus on either reinforcement learning or the application of transformers separately, which makes this integration noteworthy. Furthermore, the practical implications of using a scalable and adaptive prompting strategy significantly enhance the learning capabilities of decision transformers, a valuable advancement for practitioners in machine learning. However, while the paper demonstrates promising preliminary results, it does not provide extensive comparative analyses against state-of-the-art methods in the same category. The empirical validation, while strong, could benefit from additional experiments showcasing a wider range of tasks or datasets, as well as a deeper exploration into the specific behavior of the suggested bandit strategy. Moreover, innovation could be improved by offering further insights into the computational efficiency of this method in high-dimensional or real-world scenarios. The paper is significant for its contribution to multi-task learning in the context of offline RL, potentially paving the way for more sophisticated models that leverage contextualities in prompt selection and task adaptation. Despite its strengths, the work might face limitations in achieving scalability in more complex environments or real-time applications without further refinements. **Score: 7**

### MoGraphGPT: Creating Interactive Scenes Using Modular LLM and Graphical Control
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04983v1)
- **Authors**: Hui Ye, Chufeng Xiao, Jiaye Leng, Pengfei Xu, Hongbo Fu
- **Abstract**: Creating interactive scenes often involves complex programming tasks. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can generate code from natural language, their output is often error-prone, particularly when scripting interactions among multiple elements. The linear conversational structure limits the editing of individual elements, and lacking graphical and precise control complicates visual integration. To address these issues, we integrate an element-level modularization technique that processes textual descriptions for individual elements through separate LLM modules, with a central module managing interactions among elements. This modular approach allows for refining each element independently. We design a graphical user interface, MoGraphGPT , which combines modular LLMs with enhanced graphical control to generate codes for 2D interactive scenes. It enables direct integration of graphical information and offers quick, precise control through automatically generated sliders. Our comparative evaluation against an AI coding tool, Cursor Composer, as the baseline system and a usability study show MoGraphGPT significantly improves easiness, controllability, and refinement in creating complex 2D interactive scenes with multiple visual elements in a coding-free manner.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces MoGraphGPT, a novel framework designed to simplify the creation of interactive 2D scenes by utilizing a modular approach with large language models (LLMs). It addresses the shortcomings of existing LLMs, such as error-prone code generation and the challenges posed by linear conversational structures. By separating the processing of textual descriptions for individual scene elements into dedicated LLM modules, the framework allows for independent refinement of each element while a central module manages their interactions.  MoGraphGPT features an intuitive graphical user interface that combines these modular LLMs with enhanced graphical controls, including user-generated sliders for rapid adjustment of visual elements. Comparative evaluations against a baseline AI coding tool, Cursor Composer, and a usability study indicate that MoGraphGPT significantly enhances user experience, easiness, controllability, and the ability to refine complex interactive scenes without the need for coding expertise. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Modular Approach**: The proposal to modularize LLM processing represents an innovative step, allowing users to address individual elements more flexibly and effectively than traditional single-module systems.     2. **Graphical Control Integration**: The inclusion of a graphical interface with sliders adds a significant usability enhancement, making the tool more accessible to non-programmers. This integration is particularly valuable in educational settings or among creators without programming backgrounds.     3. **Comparative Evaluation**: The paper's rigorous evaluation against an existing tool (Cursor Composer) adds credibility to its claims, showcasing the practical benefits of MoGraphGPT. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns**: While modularization may work well for small to medium-sized projects, the approach may face challenges when scaling to more complex scenes with numerous elements and interactions, potentially leading to performance issues.     2. **Dependence on LLM Quality**: The novelty of the framework is partially reliant on the current capabilities of LLMs. If LLM technology evolves (or if other AI-driven solutions emerge), the effectiveness of MoGraphGPT may diminish.     3. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: The usability study, although beneficial, may not cover diverse user groups extensively. Future studies should expand to assess performance across various demographics and use cases. ### Conclusion Overall, MoGraphGPT presents a meaningful contribution to the field of interactive scene creation, particularly through its innovative modular approach and user-centered design. The framework addresses significant usability challenges in using LLMs for generating code, significantly enhancing the experience for users lacking programming skills. However, some concerns regarding scalability and dependency on LLMs highlight areas for future improvement. **Score: 8**  This score reflects its solid innovation and practical application in the field, tempered by valid concerns regarding its long-term viability and broader applicability.

### CMamba: Learned Image Compression with State Space Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04988v1)
- **Authors**: Zhuojie Wu, Heming Du, Shuyun Wang, Ming Lu, Haiyang Sun, Yandong Guo, Xin Yu
- **Abstract**: Learned Image Compression (LIC) has explored various architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, in modeling image content distributions in order to achieve compression effectiveness. However, achieving high rate-distortion performance while maintaining low computational complexity (\ie, parameters, FLOPs, and latency) remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Convolution and State Space Models (SSMs) based image compression framework, termed \textit{CMamba}, to achieve superior rate-distortion performance with low computational complexity. Specifically, CMamba introduces two key components: a Content-Adaptive SSM (CA-SSM) module and a Context-Aware Entropy (CAE) module. First, we observed that SSMs excel in modeling overall content but tend to lose high-frequency details. In contrast, CNNs are proficient at capturing local details. Motivated by this, we propose the CA-SSM module that can dynamically fuse global content extracted by SSM blocks and local details captured by CNN blocks in both encoding and decoding stages. As a result, important image content is well preserved during compression. Second, our proposed CAE module is designed to reduce spatial and channel redundancies in latent representations after encoding. Specifically, our CAE leverages SSMs to parameterize the spatial content in latent representations. Benefiting from SSMs, CAE significantly improves spatial compression efficiency while reducing spatial content redundancies. Moreover, along the channel dimension, CAE reduces inter-channel redundancies of latent representations via an autoregressive manner, which can fully exploit prior knowledge from previous channels without sacrificing efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that CMamba achieves superior rate-distortion performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel image compression framework named CMamba, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with State Space Models (SSMs) to enhance rate-distortion performance while addressing computational efficiency. The framework features two main components: a Content-Adaptive SSM (CA-SSM) module that merges the ability of SSMs to model global image content with CNNs’ strength in capturing local details, and a Context-Aware Entropy (CAE) module that optimizes latent representation by reducing both spatial and channel redundancies. By leveraging these two components, CMamba effectively preserves essential image details during compression and improves overall compression efficiency. Experimental results indicate that CMamba outperforms existing methods in rate-distortion performance. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Hybrid Approach**: The integration of CNNs and SSMs provides a fresh perspective in learned image compression. The authors identify the complementary strengths of both architectures and successfully devise a method to leverage them. 2. **Content-Adaptive Mechanism**: The CA-SSM module's ability to fuse global and local features is a significant contribution. It addresses a notable gap in previous methods that either focus on local detail or overall content but not on integrating both effectively. 3. **Improved Entropy Coding**: The CAE module exhibits innovation by targeting redundancies in the compressing stage, thus improving spatial and channel efficiency—an area that has not received extensive focus in existing literature. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the proposed method shows improvements in performance, the hybrid structure could add complexity that may deter practical applications. The authors should provide more concrete details on how to implement the model efficiently. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper should have included more comparative metrics with other leading approaches, particularly those with similar hybrid strategies, to emphasize the performance gains more effectively. 3. **Evaluation Scope**: While the paper claims to achieve superior rate-distortion performance, the benchmarks and datasets used for testing are critical factors in validating the results. The authors could strengthen their claims by including a broader range of datasets or scenarios. Given the innovative blending of methodologies and the improvements shown in performance without exponential increases in computational demands, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field of learned image compression. ### Score: 8 This score reflects the paper's strong novelty through the hybrid approach and its technical execution in creating successful modules for improved performance. However, the balance of theory and practical applicability needs reinforcement, and further comparative analysis would bolster its impact. Thus, while it is a significant advancement, further validation and practical considerations prevent it from achieving a top score.

### C2GM: Cascading Conditional Generation of Multi-scale Maps from Remote Sensing Images Constrained by Geographic Features
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04991v1)
- **Authors**: Chenxing Sun, Yongyang Xu, Xuwei Xu, Xixi Fan, Jing Bai, Xiechun Lu, Zhanlong Chen
- **Abstract**: Multi-scale maps are essential representations of surveying and cartographic results, serving as fundamental components of geographic services. Current image generation networks can quickly produce map tiles from remote-sensing images. However, generative models designed for natural images often focus on texture features, neglecting the unique characteristics of remote-sensing features and the scale attributes of tile maps. This limitation in generative models impairs the accurate representation of geographic information, and the quality of tile map generation still needs improvement. Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in various image generation tasks, highlighting their potential to address this challenge. This paper presents C2GM, a novel framework for generating multi-scale tile maps through conditional guided diffusion and multi-scale cascade generation. Specifically, we implement a conditional feature fusion encoder to extract object priors from remote sensing images and cascade reference double branch input, ensuring an accurate representation of complex features. Low-level generated tiles act as constraints for high-level map generation, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, we incorporate map scale modality information using CLIP to simulate the relationship between map scale and cartographic generalization in tile maps. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that C2GM consistently achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all metrics, facilitating the rapid and effective generation of multi-scale large-format maps for emergency response and remote mapping applications.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces C2GM, a novel framework aimed at improving the generation of multi-scale maps from remote-sensing images, particularly addressing shortcomings in existing generative models that focus too much on texture features while neglecting geographic information. The C2GM framework utilizes a conditional guided diffusion approach and a multi-scale cascade generation technique. Key to the model is the implementation of a conditional feature fusion encoder that extracts object priors from remote-sensing images, which allows for accurate representation of complex features. The model operates in a hierarchical manner, where lower-level map tiles serve as constraints for the generation of higher-level maps, enhancing visual continuity. Moreover, it integrates map scale modality using CLIP to better handle relationships between map scale and generalization. Experimental results show that C2GM outperforms other methods, establishing a state-of-the-art performance in generating multi-scale large-format maps, which could be particularly useful for emergency response and remote mapping applications. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of remote sensing and map generation by applying diffusion models, which have been more commonly associated with natural image synthesis. The integration of features specific to remote-sensing images and considering geographic constraints sets a new precedent in generative modeling for cartographic applications. The hierarchical approach that cascades map generation based on tile quality is innovative, as it reflects an understanding of the complexities involved in geographic features. **Strengths:** - **Innovative Approach:** The combination of conditional feature fusion and cascading generation is novel and addresses challenges in map generation that previous models have overlooked. - **Use of State-of-the-Art Techniques:** Employing diffusion models in a novel context shows the versatile application of these models beyond natural image generation. - **Practical Applications:** The focus on emergency response and remote mapping provides a real-world application and highlights the framework's potential impact on urgent geographic information needs. **Weaknesses:** - **Complexity:** The proposed framework necessitates a sophisticated understanding of multiple generations and interactions, which may limit accessibility to practitioners who lack deep expertise in these models. - **Assessment of Performance:** While the paper claims state-of-the-art performance, a critical evaluation of the benchmarks used is necessary. The results might be influenced by selected conditions that may not generalize to all remote-sensing contexts. **Potential Influence:** The C2GM framework has the potential to influence future research in geographic information systems (GIS) by setting new standards for map generation quality and potentially inspiring adaptations of similar methodologies for different geographic applications. However, the complexity involved may hinder widespread adoption unless simplified frameworks are developed around its core concepts. **Score: 8** The score reflects the significant contribution of the paper to remote sensing and map generation, particularly through the use of advanced diffusion models tailored to geographic specificity. While the innovation is commendable and carries practical implications, the complexity and potential limitations in performance assessment contribute to a slightly lower score than a perfect 10, indicating room for further refinement and validation in varied contexts.

### Aligning Black-box Language Models with Human Judgments
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04997v1)
- **Authors**: Gerrit J. J. van den Burg, Gen Suzuki, Wei Liu, Murat Sensoy
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated judges to evaluate recommendation systems, search engines, and other subjective tasks, where relying on human evaluators can be costly, time-consuming, and unscalable. LLMs offer an efficient solution for continuous, automated evaluation. However, since the systems that are built and improved with these judgments are ultimately designed for human use, it is crucial that LLM judgments align closely with human evaluators to ensure such systems remain human-centered. On the other hand, aligning LLM judgments with human evaluators is challenging due to individual variability and biases in human judgments. We propose a simple yet effective framework to align LLM judgments with individual human evaluators or their aggregated judgments, without retraining or fine-tuning the LLM. Our approach learns a linear mapping between the LLM's outputs and human judgments, achieving over 142% average improvement in agreement across 29 tasks with only a small number of calibration examples used for training. Notably, our method works in zero-shot and few-shot settings, exceeds inter-human agreement on four out of six tasks, and enables smaller LLMs to achieve performance comparable to that of larger models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Aligning Black-box Language Models with Human Judgments" investigates the challenges of using large language models (LLMs) as automated evaluators for recommendation systems and other subjective tasks. Given that LLMs need to align their judgments with human evaluators, the authors propose a framework that establishes a linear mapping between LLM outputs and human judgments without requiring retraining of the models. Their approach demonstrates significant improvements, with an average agreement increase of over 142% across 29 tasks using minimal calibration examples. The method performs well in both zero-shot and few-shot contexts, surpasses inter-human agreement on several tasks, and allows smaller LLMs to perform comparably to larger ones. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a notable advancement in aligning LLMs with human evaluative standards, a topic of increasing relevance as these models become more integrated into automated systems. The proposed framework offers a pragmatic solution to the problem of individual human judgment variability and bias without the need for extensive model retraining, making it accessible for practical applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Application**: The framework addresses a real-world challenge faced by developers of recommendation systems and search engines, directly contributing to the usability of LLMs in these contexts. 2. **Significant Results**: The reported improvement in agreement shows that the approach can substantially enhance the performance of LLMs, suggesting significant implications for deployment in real-world applications. 3. **Generalizability**: The fact that the method works in zero-shot and few-shot settings increases its applicability across different contexts and tasks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Methodological Limitations**: While the linear mapping is innovative for certain applications, the approach might oversimplify the complexities of human evaluations. Contextual nuances in human judgment could be lost through such a method. 2. **Generalizability Concerns**: The reliance on a small sample of calibration examples raises questions about the robustness of the findings across a wider variety of tasks and domains. 3. **Lack of Depth**: The paper might benefit from more extensive analyses of how different sources of human variation affect the validity of its proposed mapping. **Potential Influence**: The paper's contribution is significant as it offers insights into enhancing alignment between LLM outputs and human judgments, a crucial step in ensuring that AI systems remain user-friendly and human-centered. This influence is particularly important in fields like human-computer interaction and machine learning ethics, providing a foundation for future research and application-based studies. Based on the above strengths and weaknesses, I assign the paper a score of **8**. This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with practical implications and significant results, albeit tempered by some methodological concerns and the need for broader validation in diverse settings. **Score: 8**

### Robust Graph Learning Against Adversarial Evasion Attacks via Prior-Free Diffusion-Based Structure Purification
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05000v1)
- **Authors**: Jiayi Luo, Qingyun Sun, Haonan Yuan, Xingcheng Fu, Jianxin Li
- **Abstract**: Adversarial evasion attacks pose significant threats to graph learning, with lines of studies that have improved the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking strategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph learning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we investigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification framework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model to learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed structures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured predictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the forward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which structure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during the forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism to selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment between the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse process, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer entropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper presents a novel approach to enhancing the robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adversarial evasion attacks through a framework called Diffusion-based Structure Purification (DiffSP). Unlike prior methods that depend on assumptions about clean graphs or specific attacking strategies, DiffSP operates without these priors. It utilizes a diffusion model to identify and purify perturbed graph structures by leveraging the predictive patterns obtained from the model. The process consists of two parts: a forward diffusion that introduces controlled noise to avoid information loss, and a reverse denoising process aimed at aligning the purified graph with the original semantic content of the clean graph. The proposed mechanisms, specifically an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion and graph transfer entropy guided denoising, are empirically validated to demonstrate enhanced resilience against various evasion attacks. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**   The paper introduces a significant shift in tackling robustness in graph learning by moving away from reliance on prior knowledge, which has been a limitation in many existing techniques. By proposing a structure purification strategy that uses a diffusion model, the authors add a fresh perspective to the field, which is an important contribution, considering the growing concern of adversarial attacks on machine learning models. Additionally, the method of selectively injecting noise nonisotropically is a notable advancement, as it demonstrates a nuanced approach to maintaining information integrity during purification.  **Significance:**   The significance of this contribution is highlighted by the urgent need for effective defenses against adversarial attacks in real-world applications that utilize GNNs. The ability to perform structure purification without prior assumptions could broaden the applicability of GNNs in various domains, thereby addressing a critical challenge. **Strengths:** - The innovative use of a prior-free diffusion model is a key strength, as it increases the method's flexibility and robustness against different forms of attacks. - The detailed experimental validation provides concrete evidence of the method's effectiveness, reinforcing its potential. - The theoretical underpinnings and sophisticated mechanisms proposed contribute to the robustness and reliability of the framework. **Weaknesses:** - Although the approach shows promise, the complexity of the method might limit its practical implementation in time-sensitive applications where efficiency is critical. - The paper could further enhance its impact by more thoroughly comparing its performance against a broader range of existing state-of-the-art methods in diverse settings to comprehensively showcase its advantages and limitations. **Overall Impact:**   While the framework is promising and novel, further exploration into its scalability and practical usability in real-world scenarios would increase its relevance and impact in the field. **Score: 8**   The score reflects a strong contribution that addresses critical challenges in GNN robustness while maintaining scientific rigor. However, some limitations in practical applicability and a need for broader comparative studies prevent a perfect score.

### QuEST: Stable Training of LLMs with 1-Bit Weights and Activations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05003v1)
- **Authors**: Andrei Panferov, Jiale Chen, Soroush Tabesh, Roberto L. Castro, Mahdi Nikdan, Dan Alistarh
- **Abstract**: One approach to reducing the massive costs of large language models (LLMs) is the use of quantized or sparse representations for training or deployment. While post-training compression methods are very popular, the question of obtaining even more accurate compressed models by directly training over such representations, i.e., Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), is still open: for example, a recent study (arXiv:2411.04330v2) put the "optimal" bit-width at which models can be trained using QAT, while staying accuracy-competitive with standard FP16/BF16 precision, at 8-bits weights and activations. We advance this state-of-the-art via a new method called QuEST, which is Pareto-competitive with FP16, i.e., it provides better accuracy at lower model size, while training models with weights and activations in 4-bits or less. Moreover, QuEST allows stable training with 1-bit weights and activations. QuEST achieves this by improving two key aspects of QAT methods: (1) accurate and fast quantization of the (continuous) distributions of weights and activations via Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting; (2) a new trust gradient estimator based on the idea of explicitly minimizing the error between the noisy gradient computed over quantized states and the "true" (but unknown) full-precision gradient. Experiments on Llama-type architectures show that QuEST induces stable scaling laws across the entire range of hardware-supported precisions, and can be extended to sparse representations. We provide GPU kernel support showing that models produced by QuEST can be executed efficiently. Our code is available at https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QuEST.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces QuEST, a novel approach to Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) aimed at enhancing the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by allowing their weights and activations to be quantized to 4-bits or lower, including 1-bit representations. QuEST purports to achieve better accuracy than standard FP16/BF16 models while reducing model size, addressing limitations of current QAT methods. The authors propose improvements to two critical elements: (1) they enhance the quantization process by implementing Hadamard normalization and mean-square error optimal fitting for continuous distributions of weights and activations, and (2) they develop a trust gradient estimator that minimizes the error between noisy gradients from quantized states and true gradients from full precision. Experiments conducted on Llama-type architectures demonstrate that QuEST maintains stable scaling laws across various hardware-supported precisions and shows positive results for sparse representations. The authors provide GPU kernel support to enable efficient execution of QuEST-derived models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper's contribution lies in its ability to enable stable training of LLMs using extremely quantized weights and activations, contrasting with previous post-training methods and existing QAT strategies that typically utilize higher precision levels. The methodology surrounding Hadamard normalization and the trust gradient estimator does represent a significant advancement in the quantization field. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: QuEST's ability to effectively use 1-bit quantization while still maintaining good accuracy is significant. Most conventional approaches have not found stable methods to work with such low-bit representations during training. 2. **Comprehensive Experiments**: The experiments on Llama architectures showcase practical applications of their method and confirm the theoretical claims, providing valuable insights into the method's efficacy. 3. **Technical Rigor**: The techniques employed to improve quantization and gradient estimation appear well-considered and grounded in solid theoretical justifications. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Applicability**: While QuEST showcases effective results, the paper may lack broad applicability beyond the specific architectures tested. A wider range of experiments across various model types could strengthen the claims. 2. **Limited Comparisons**: The authors reference previous studies but do not thoroughly benchmark against all available quantization methods. A more extensive comparative analysis could validate the improvements claimed. 3. **Real-world Viability**: While the theoretical advancements are clear, it remains to be seen how well QuEST performs in real-world applications, which often present additional challenges not fully captured in controlled experiments. **Impact**: QuEST represents an important stride forward in LLM training, particularly for scenarios requiring resource-constrained models. The novelty and technical advancements contribute positively to the field, particularly for efficiency in deployment. **Overall Score**: Given the methodological advancements, promising results, and potential implications for future research and application, the paper warrants a high score. However, its limitations in broader applicability and the need for more rigorous comparisons temper the overall evaluation. Score: 8

- **Authors**: Geliang Ouyang, Jingyao Chen, Zhihe Nie, Yi Gui, Yao Wan, Hongyu Zhang, Dongping Chen
- **Abstract**: Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) seeks to convert natural-language descriptions into visual representations of given tables, empowering users to derive insights from large-scale data. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating code generation to transform tabular data into accessible visualizations. However, they often struggle with complex queries that require reasoning across multiple tables. To address this limitation, we propose a collaborative agent workflow, termed nvAgent, for NL2Vis. Specifically, nvAgent comprises three agents: a processor agent for database processing and context filtering, a composer agent for planning visualization generation, and a validator agent for code translation and output verification. Comprehensive evaluations on the new VisEval benchmark demonstrate that nvAgent consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 7.88% improvement in single-table and a 9.23% improvement in multi-table scenarios. Qualitative analyses further highlight that nvAgent maintains nearly a 20% performance margin over previous models, underscoring its capacity to produce high-quality visual representations from complex, heterogeneous data sources.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents **nvAgent**, a collaborative agent workflow designed to enhance Natural Language to Visualization (NL2Vis) by automating the process of converting natural language descriptions into visual data representations. The proposed system addresses limitations of existing methods, particularly with complex queries that require reasoning across multiple tables. **nvAgent** consists of three distinct agents: a processor agent for context filtering and database processing, a composer agent for visualization planning, and a validator agent for code generation and verification. Evaluations using the new **VisEval** benchmark show that nvAgent outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 7.88% for single-table scenarios and 9.23% for multi-table scenarios. Qualitative analyses reaffirm its superiority, highlighting a nearly 20% performance advantage in generating visualizations from diverse and complex data sources. ### Critical Evaluation and Rationale **Novelty and Significance**:  This research introduces a novel approach by decomposing the NL2Vis task into a systematic workflow involving multiple intelligent agents, which is a departure from conventional single-agent models. The focus on handling complex, multi-table queries marks a significant step forward in addressing a pressing problem in the field of data visualization from natural language, where current systems often struggle. **Strengths**:  - **Framework's Architecture**: The collaborative agent workflow is innovative, leveraging specialization among agents to enhance performance. Each agent’s distinct role optimizes the process, making it robust against complex input. - **Performance Metrics**: The substantial improvements reported against state-of-the-art baselines in both single-table and multi-table scenarios provide credible evidence of the framework's effectiveness. - **Qualitative Assessment**: The paper’s inclusion of qualitative analysis alongside quantitative metrics enriches the evaluation and supports the authors' claims of superior performance. **Weaknesses**:  - **Scope of Evaluation**: While the results are promising, the paper may overlook limitations in the agent's ability to generalize across various domains or data types outside the tested parameters. - **Complexity of Interaction**: Managing three different agents introduces complexity that may lead to challenges in implementation or scaling, which are not fully addressed in the paper. **Potential Influence**:  The proposed framework has the potential to significantly impact the NL2Vis domain by providing a more effective mechanism to bridge natural language processing and data visualization. If adopted in practical applications, nvAgent could facilitate broader access to visual data representation, thereby assisting a wider range of users, including those without technical backgrounds. **Conclusion**: Given the innovative framework, clear enhancements in performance, and the critical identification of a significant problem in existing systems, I find nvAgent to be a noteworthy contribution to the field of data visualization from natural language. **Score: 8**

### Federated Learning for Anomaly Detection in Energy Consumption Data: Assessing the Vulnerability to Adversarial Attacks
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05041v1)
- **Authors**: Yohannis Kifle Telila, Damitha Senevirathne, Dumindu Tissera, Apurva Narayan, Miriam A. M. Capretz, Katarina Grolinger
- **Abstract**: Anomaly detection is crucial in the energy sector to identify irregular patterns indicating equipment failures, energy theft, or other issues. Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are typically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which raises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining popularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data. However, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions. While adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain largely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain. Moreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly unknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in energy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models, Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in an FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data. The results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks, attributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10% even with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks than centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper examines the critical role of anomaly detection in the energy sector, addressing the increasing importance of Federated Learning (FL) as a means of performing this detection while safeguarding data privacy. It highlights the vulnerability of FL to adversarial attacks—specifically focusing on time series data from the energy domain, which has been previously underexplored. The authors employ two advanced models: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, and investigate how two white-box attack methods—Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)—affect these models' performance in an FL context. Findings reveal that FL is significantly more affected by PGD attacks than FGSM, with an observable accuracy drop exceeding 10%, underscoring the heightened vulnerability of FL compared to traditional centralized learning approaches. This emphasizes the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in FL applications within the energy sector. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a timely investigation into the specific vulnerability of FL techniques to adversarial attacks within a context that is not extensively covered in existing literature—namely, the energy consumption domain. This is significant because it contributes to the understanding of FL's limitations and challenges, addressing a gap in knowledge about its performance against adversarial threats. **Strengths:** - The exploration of adversarial attacks on FL in time series data is a fresh perspective, enhancing the conversation around model robustness in distributed learning settings. - The use of state-of-the-art models (LSTM and Transformers) linked with modern attack methodologies (FGSM and PGD) provides a robust experimental framework. - The demonstration that FL suffers more under adversarial conditions compared to centralized learning raises important implications for practitioners and researchers alike, paving the way for future defense strategies. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper identifies a vulnerability, it does not propose any specific mitigation strategies or frameworks, which could be seen as a missed opportunity to contribute pragmatically to the field. - The scope of experimentation is limited to only two types of attacks, which may not fully represent the broad spectrum of potential threats to FL in operational contexts. - The practical implications of the findings might benefit from more extensive real-world validation, given that the study primarily remains within a controlled experimental setting. Overall, while the paper contributes valuable insights into an emerging area of study, its lack of proposed solutions and limited attack scope might restrict its immediate applicability. However, the elucidation of the vulnerabilities in FL is crucial, indicating that this research could motivate further studies aimed at enhancing the security of federated models. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's meaningful contributions to the conversation around FL and its vulnerabilities, balanced against its limitations in providing proactive solutions and broader test scenarios.

### Beautiful Images, Toxic Words: Understanding and Addressing Offensive Text in Generated Images
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05066v1)
- **Authors**: Aditya Kumar, Tom Blanchard, Adam Dziedzic, Franziska Boenisch
- **Abstract**: State-of-the-art visual generation models, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Vision Auto-Regressive Models (VARs), produce highly realistic images. While prior work has successfully mitigated Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content in the visual domain, we identify a novel threat: the generation of NSFW text embedded within images. This includes offensive language, such as insults, racial slurs, and sexually explicit terms, posing significant risks to users. We show that all state-of-the-art DMs (e.g., SD3, Flux, DeepFloyd IF) and VARs (e.g., Infinity) are vulnerable to this issue. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that existing mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent harmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation. As an initial step toward addressing this threat, we explore safety fine-tuning of the text encoder underlying major DM architectures using a customized dataset. Thereby, we suppress NSFW generation while preserving overall image and text generation quality. Finally, to advance research in this area, we introduce ToxicBench, an open-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images. ToxicBench provides a curated dataset of harmful prompts, new metrics, and an evaluation pipeline assessing both NSFW-ness and generation quality. Our benchmark aims to guide future efforts in mitigating NSFW text generation in text-to-image models and is available at https://github.com/sprintml/ToxicBench
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Beautiful Images, Toxic Words: Understanding and Addressing Offensive Text in Generated Images" addresses a critical issue in the field of visual generation models, particularly in regards to the unintended generation of offensive text within images produced by state-of-the-art models, such as Diffusion Models (DMs) and Vision Auto-Regressive Models (VARs). The authors highlight that while there has been progress in reducing Not Safe For Work (NSFW) visual content, there is a significant oversight concerning the generation of harmful text like insults and racial slurs incorporated into these images. The study reveals that current models are not only susceptible to this problem but that existing mitigation techniques for visual content fail to effectively address the generation of offensive texts. To confront this, the authors propose a safety fine-tuning approach to the text encoder used in major DMs to diminish NSFW text generation while maintaining the quality of both text and image outputs.

### Paying Attention to Facts: Quantifying the Knowledge Capacity of Attention Layers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05076v1)
- **Authors**: Liang Ze Wong
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we investigate the ability of single-layer attention-only transformers (i.e. attention layers) to memorize facts contained in databases from a linear-algebraic perspective. We associate with each database a 3-tensor, propose the rank of this tensor as a measure of the size of the database, and provide bounds on the rank in terms of properties of the database. We also define a 3-tensor corresponding to an attention layer, and empirically demonstrate the relationship between its rank and database rank on a dataset of toy models and random databases. By highlighting the roles played by the value-output and query-key weights, and the effects of argmax and softmax on rank, our results shed light on the `additive motif' of factual recall in transformers, while also suggesting a way of increasing layer capacity without increasing the number of parameters.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Paying Attention to Facts: Quantifying the Knowledge Capacity of Attention Layers" examines the knowledge retention capabilities of single-layer attention-only transformers through a linear-algebraic framework. It associates databases with 3-tensors, proposing that the tensor rank serves as a measure of database size and provides theoretical bounds on this rank based on database properties. By defining a corresponding 3-tensor for an attention layer, the authors empirically establish the relationship between the ranks of the attention layer and the database. The study emphasizes the significance of value-output and query-key weights, and the influence of argmax and softmax functions on rank. Ultimately, it provides insights into the 'additive motif' of factual recall in transformers and suggests potential methods for enhancing layer capacity without increasing parameters. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The paper introduces a linear-algebraic perspective to analyze attention layers, which is a fresh angle in understanding the capacity of these models in memorizing factual information. 2. **Quantitative Measure**: By associating factual databases with ranks of tensors, the authors provide a concrete way to quantify the knowledge capacity of attention layers, which is significant for future design and analysis of transformer architectures. 3. **Practical Implications**: Highlighting the roles of different weights (value-output and query-key) and the effects of argmax/softmax functions improves interpretability and can lead to more efficient model structures in real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the study focuses on single-layer attention mechanisms, it may lack generalizability to multi-layer attention architectures, which are more commonly used in practice. 2. **Toy Models and Random Databases**: The empirical validation relies on toy models, which could lead to questions regarding the practical applicability of the findings to real-world databases and complex tasks. 3. **Potential Overemphasis on Rank**: The significance of tensor rank may not fully capture the nuances of model behavior and can be seen as an oversimplification of how transformers learn and recall facts. Overall, while the research provides valuable insights and introduces novel concepts, its limitations may temper its impact on more complex, real-world scenarios. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's novel contributions to understanding the quantification of knowledge capacity in attention layers while acknowledging its limitations in broader applicability and the somewhat constrained empirical validation. It's a solid contribution to the discussion of transformer architectures, but its overall impact may hinge on further research that scales and validates its findings in more complex settings.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05078v1)
- **Authors**: Tushar Pandey, Ara Ghukasyan, Oktay Goktas, Santosh Kumar Radha
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities, yet their performance is highly dependent on the prompting strategy and model scale. While reinforcement learning and fine-tuning have been deployed to boost reasoning, these approaches incur substantial computational and data overhead. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Graph of Thoughts (AGoT), a dynamic, graph-based inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning solely at test time. Rather than relying on fixed-step methods like Chain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), AGoT recursively decomposes complex queries into structured subproblems, forming an dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interdependent reasoning steps. By selectively expanding only those subproblems that require further analysis, AGoT unifies the strengths of chain, tree, and graph paradigms into a cohesive framework that allocates computation where it is most needed. We validate our approach on diverse benchmarks spanning multi-hop retrieval, scientific reasoning, and mathematical problem-solving, achieving up to 46.2% improvement on scientific reasoning tasks (GPQA) - comparable to gains achieved through computationally intensive reinforcement learning approaches and outperforming state-of-the-art iterative approaches. These results suggest that dynamic decomposition and structured recursion offer a scalable, cost-effective alternative to post-training modifications, paving the way for more robust, general-purpose reasoning in LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces Adaptive Graph of Thoughts (AGoT), a novel inference framework designed to improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) at test time without incurring significant computational overhead. AGoT departs from traditional approaches like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts (ToT) by employing a dynamic directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure that allows for recursive decomposition of complex queries. This framework selectively focuses on subproblems requiring additional analysis, thus optimizing computational effort. The authors demonstrate AGoT's effectiveness through various benchmarks, showing an impressive up to 46.2% performance improvement in scientific reasoning tasks compared to other state-of-the-art methods, including those that utilize more resource-intensive techniques. The approach suggests a promising pathway for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a scalable and cost-effective manner. ### Evaluation **Novelty**: The concept of AGoT represents a significant shift in the way reasoning tasks are approached in LLMs. By introducing a framework that combines elements from chain, tree, and graph methodologies while offering a dynamic and adaptive way to resolve subproblems, the paper stands out in a rapidly evolving field. The innovative use of a DAG for task decomposition is notably original and reflects a thoughtful integration of existing paradigms into a single cohesive structure. **Strengths**:  - The empirical results are compelling, demonstrating substantial improvements in reasoning tasks without requiring extensive retraining or reinforcement learning, which typically involve high computational costs. - The proposed framework is flexible and adaptive, suggesting that it could be widely applicable across different reasoning scenarios, enhancing its potential utility. - The paper thoroughly validates its claims with diverse benchmarks, showcasing the robustness of AGoT across various types of reasoning challenges. **Weaknesses**:  - While the performance gains are impressive, the paper lacks detailed comparative analyses against a broader range of methodologies. Future work could benefit from exploring more techniques, particularly those that have emerged recently in the context of LLM advancements. - The theoretical foundations of why the dynamic DAG approach leads to better performance relative to previous static methods could be elaborated more. Increased attention to the underlying mechanisms could help to contextualize the findings within the larger landscape of reasoning methodologies. - The scalability of AGoT in more complex or less structured environments is not deeply addressed, leaving the practical limits of the approach somewhat ambiguous. **Potential Impact**: AGoT has the potential to influence the field significantly by providing a scalable alternative to existing reasoning enhancements for LLMs. Its focus on dynamic adaptation at test time could inspire further studies into cost-effective reasoning strategies, potentially reshaping practices in the deployment of LLMs for complex tasks. **Score**: 8  This score reflects the paper's considerable contributions to the field, particularly regarding its novel approach and solid empirical results, while acknowledging its limitations in comparative depth and theoretical insights.

- **Authors**: Xiaoyu Deng, Ye Zhang, Tianmin Guo, Yongzhe Zhang, Zhengjian Kang, Hang Yang
- **Abstract**: The astonishing performance of large language models (LLMs) and their remarkable achievements in production and daily life have led to their widespread application in collaborative tasks. However, current large models face challenges such as hallucination and lack of specificity in content generation in vertical domain tasks. Inspired by the contrast and classification mechanisms in human cognitive processes, this paper constructs an adversarial learning-based prompt framework named ChallengeMe, which includes three cascaded solutions: generation prompts, evaluation prompts, and feedback optimization. In this process, we designed seven core optimization dimensions and set the threshold for adversarial learning. The results of mixed case studies on the text summarization task show that the proposed framework can generate more accurate and fluent text summaries compared to the current advanced mainstream LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents "ChallengeMe," an innovative framework designed for text summarization, which leverages adversarial learning to enhance the prompt generation process. The authors address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), particularly issues of hallucination and non-specific content in niche domain tasks. ChallengeMe operates through three interconnected components: generation prompts, evaluation prompts, and feedback optimization. By defining seven key optimization dimensions and establishing a threshold for adversarial learning, the framework aims to improve the accuracy and fluency of text summaries. Empirical results demonstrate that ChallengeMe outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in generating coherent and contextually relevant summaries. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The novelty of the paper lies in its integration of adversarial learning principles into the text summarization process through a structured prompt framework. While adversarial learning has been applied in various domains, its application particularly in enhancing prompt design for LLMs in summarization tasks is relatively unexplored. This approach shows promise in addressing known issues with LLMs, which strengthens its innovative aspect. **Significance:** The significance of the paper is marked by its potential to improve the reliability and specificity of text summarization, a critical task in numerous applications including information extraction, content curation, and user support technologies. By providing a systematic means to optimize prompts and reduce hallucinations, ChallengeMe could impact broader natural language processing tasks. **Strengths:** 1. **Robust Framework:** The structured approach of cascading prompts and optimization dimensions provides a comprehensive method for improving text summarization. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The inclusion of mixed case studies offers tangible evidence supporting the effectiveness of the ChallengeMe framework over existing LLMs. 3. **Interdisciplinary Insight:** The research draws inspiration from cognitive processes, which may offer valuable perspectives for future research in AI and cognitive modeling. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising, the applicability of ChallengeMe across diverse domains and tasks remains to be explored. It would be beneficial if the authors provided further evidence of versatility. 2. **Complexity vs. Usability:** The complexity introduced by adversarial optimization may pose a barrier for practical adoption in real-world applications unless simplified or automated solutions are provided. 3. **Comparison Baseline:** The paper could enhance its credibility by comparing ChallengeMe with a broader range of contemporary summarization methods beyond just the most advanced LLMs. **Overall Assessment:** Considering the novelty and implications of the work, alongside its strengths and limitations, I would assign the paper a score of **8**. It presents a promising framework with potential advancements in the text summarization field, but further validation and exploration of the framework's generalizability and practical usability are necessary to consolidate its impact.  **Score: 8**

### Causality can systematically address the monsters under the bench(marks)
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05085v1)
- **Authors**: Felix Leeb, Zhijing Jin, Bernhard Schölkopf
- **Abstract**: Effective and reliable evaluation is essential for advancing empirical machine learning. However, the increasing accessibility of generalist models and the progress towards ever more complex, high-level tasks make systematic evaluation more challenging. Benchmarks are plagued by various biases, artifacts, or leakage, while models may behave unreliably due to poorly explored failure modes. Haphazard treatments and inconsistent formulations of such "monsters" can contribute to a duplication of efforts, a lack of trust in results, and unsupported inferences. In this position paper, we argue causality offers an ideal framework to systematically address these challenges. By making causal assumptions in an approach explicit, we can faithfully model phenomena, formulate testable hypotheses with explanatory power, and leverage principled tools for analysis. To make causal model design more accessible, we identify several useful Common Abstract Topologies (CATs) in causal graphs which help gain insight into the reasoning abilities in large language models. Through a series of case studies, we demonstrate how the precise yet pragmatic language of causality clarifies the strengths and limitations of a method and inspires new approaches for systematic progress.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Causality can systematically address the monsters under the bench(marks)" addresses significant challenges in the evaluation of empirical machine learning. Acknowledging the increasing complexity of tasks and the various biases present in benchmarks, the authors argue that traditional evaluation methods often fall short due to unaddressed failure modes in models. They propose that incorporating causality provides a systematic framework for these evaluations by making causal assumptions explicit, allowing for the generation of testable hypotheses and enhancing analytical rigor. Through the introduction of Common Abstract Topologies (CATs), the paper aims to improve access to causal model design and showcase the reasoning abilities of large language models. Case studies illustrate the potential of applying causal reasoning to clarify method strengths and weaknesses, and guide future research directions. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a thoughtful perspective on a pressing issue in machine learning evaluation. Its novelty arises from the application of causality as a systematic approach to tackle the identified "monsters" (i.e., biases and unreliabilities) in empirical evaluations. By doing so, it encourages a shift in research practices toward a more robust foundation that not only assesses model performance but also elucidates underlying causal mechanisms. The identification of CATs is particularly noteworthy, as it provides practical tools that can facilitate researchers’ understanding of complex models. However, while the arguments are compelling, the paper could be seen as somewhat broad in its claims, potentially lacking in specific empirical data to strongly support its assertions about the efficacy of causal modeling in addressing evaluation challenges. The case studies, while illustrative, might benefit from broader applications across varying kinds of models and tasks to comprehensively demonstrate the utility of causality. Moreover, the paper does not engage deeply with existing literature on evaluation challenges, which could provide richer contextual framing. In terms of significance, the paper invites a reevaluation of standard practices in model evaluation, which may resonate well with researchers and practitioners aiming for more transparency and trustworthiness in results. This shift is crucial for the advancement of the field but may take time for widespread adoption. Despite its strengths in presenting a cohesive argument and advocating for a novel methodological approach, the paper's impact could be limited by its generality and limited empirical validation. **Score: 7**

### Mitigating Unintended Memorization with LoRA in Federated Learning for LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05087v1)
- **Authors**: Thierry Bossy, Julien Vignoud, Tahseen Rabbani, Juan R. Troncoso Pastoriza, Martin Jaggi
- **Abstract**: Federated learning (FL) is a popular paradigm for collaborative training which avoids direct data exposure between clients. However, data privacy issues still remain: FL-trained large language models are capable of memorizing and completing phrases and sentences contained in training data when given with their prefixes. Thus, it is possible for adversarial and honest-but-curious clients to recover training data of other participants simply through targeted prompting. In this work, we demonstrate that a popular and simple fine-tuning strategy, low-rank adaptation (LoRA), reduces memorization during FL up to a factor of 10. We study this effect by performing a medical question-answering fine-tuning task and injecting multiple replicas of out-of-distribution sensitive sequences drawn from an external clinical dataset. We observe a reduction in memorization for a wide variety of Llama 2 and 3 models, and find that LoRA can reduce memorization in centralized learning as well. Furthermore, we show that LoRA can be combined with other privacy-preserving techniques such as gradient clipping and Gaussian noising, secure aggregation, and Goldfish loss to further improve record-level privacy while maintaining performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Mitigating Unintended Memorization with LoRA in Federated Learning for LLMs" addresses the issue of privacy concerns in federated learning (FL), particularly how large language models (LLMs) can memorize sensitive data from training sets. The authors propose using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as a fine-tuning strategy to significantly reduce the extent of memorization during FL, achieving a reduction factor of up to 10. Their experimental work, focused on a medical question-answering task, demonstrates the effectiveness of LoRA across various Llama 2 and 3 models. The study also explores the combination of LoRA with other privacy-preserving techniques to enhance data security while retaining performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a relevant and timely inquiry into a significant issue within the domain of federated learning and its implications for privacy, especially in healthcare applications. Memorization of training data poses serious risks, making this research crucial. The approach of utilizing LoRA as a mitigation technique stands out due to its simplicity and ease of integration, which is a notable strength. The findings suggesting a reduction in memorization not only in federated settings but also in centralized learning are promising, potentially broadening the impact of the research. However, some aspects hinder its overall novelty. While LoRA has been established in previous work, the paper primarily emphasizes its application for privacy enhancement, which lacks sufficient distinction from previous studies that broadly tackle memorization issues in machine learning. Furthermore, the paper does not extensively compare LoRA against other emerging techniques in terms of effectiveness and scalability, leaving a gap in understanding its relative advantages.  The significance of the experimental application to medical data is noteworthy; however, the study could benefit from a more diverse range of data types and settings to validate its findings robustly. Additionally, the paper could have delved deeper into the implications of reduced memorization for client data protection in various real-world scenarios. In conclusion, while the paper offers valuable insights and contributes to the discourse on privacy in federated learning, its novelty is hindered by the established nature of LoRA and the limited comparative analysis provided. The combination of techniques is promising but needs more comprehensive exploration.  **Score: 7**

### DCFormer: Efficient 3D Vision-Language Modeling with Decomposed Convolutions
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05091v1)
- **Authors**: Gorkem Can Ates, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao
- **Abstract**: Vision-language models (VLMs) align visual and textual representations, enabling high-performance zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval in 2D medical imaging. However, extending VLMs to 3D medical imaging remains computationally challenging. Existing 3D VLMs rely on Vision Transformers (ViTs), which are computationally expensive due to self-attention's quadratic complexity, or 3D convolutions, which demand excessive parameters and FLOPs as kernel size increases. We introduce DCFormer, an efficient 3D medical image encoder that factorizes 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions along depth, height, and width. This design preserves spatial information while significantly reducing computational cost. Integrated into a CLIP-based vision-language framework, DCFormer is evaluated on CT-RATE, a dataset of 50,188 paired 3D chest CT volumes and radiology reports, for zero-shot multi-abnormality detection across 18 pathologies. Compared to ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet, DCFormer achieves superior efficiency and accuracy, with DCFormer-Tiny reaching 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score while using significantly fewer parameters. These results highlight DCFormer's potential for scalable, clinically deployable 3D medical VLMs. Our codes will be publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents DCFormer, a novel encoder for 3D vision-language modeling that enhances efficiency in processing 3D medical imaging data. Traditional vision-language models struggle with 3D data due to the computational intensity of Vision Transformers and high parametric demands of 3D convolutions. DCFormer mitigates these issues by decomposing 3D convolutions into three distinct 1D operations along the depth, height, and width axes, effectively preserving spatial information while reducing complexity. The model is integrated within a CLIP-based framework and evaluated on the CT-RATE dataset, consisting of 50,188 paired 3D CT scans and accompanying radiology reports. The results demonstrate that DCFormer, particularly the DCFormer-Tiny variant, outperforms established architectures like ViT, ConvNeXt, PoolFormer, and TransUNet in both efficiency and accuracy, achieving 62.0% accuracy and a 46.3% F1-score with fewer parameters. The model has significant implications for clinical application of 3D vision-language models in the medical domain. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The decomposition of 3D convolutions into three parallel 1D convolutions is a novel strategy that effectively addresses the computational challenges associated with 3D medical imaging. This innovation can inspire further research into efficient neural architectures. 2. **Clinical Relevance:** Given the importance of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools in a medical setting, the focus on scalable solutions in 3D imaging offers a significant benefit for practitioners in radiology and related fields. 3. **Solid Results:** The empirical results presented show that DCFormer not only improves efficiency and requires fewer computational resources but also enhances performance metrics in zero-shot settings, which is crucial for real-world applications where labeled data may be scarce. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The evaluation is limited to the CT-RATE dataset, which, while substantial, may not represent the full diversity of medical imaging tasks. Generalizability to a broader range of 3D imaging contexts remains uncertain. 2. **Competing Architectures:** Although the improvement over ViTs and other models is notable, there are numerous other architectures not cited, which could have provided a more comprehensive comparison (e.g., recent developments in hybrid models). 3. **Verification of Efficiency Claims:** While the paper claims reductions in computational cost and parameters, a more detailed analysis quantifying these aspects compared to baseline models would strengthen the argument. **Overall Assessment:** DCFormer offers a promising advancement in the efficient modeling of 3D vision-language tasks, particularly for medical imaging, which is characterized by its computational intricacies. The novel approach to convolution decomposition provides a basis for future research on efficient architectures in both medical and broader vision-language domains. However, the research would benefit from more extensive validation across various datasets and inclusion of a broader range of baseline comparisons. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Understanding time from visual representations is a fundamental cognitive skill, yet it remains a challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we investigate the capabilities of MLLMs in interpreting time and date through analogue clocks and yearly calendars. To facilitate this, we curated a structured dataset comprising two subsets: 1) $\textit{ClockQA}$, which comprises various types of clock styles$-$standard, black-dial, no-second-hand, Roman numeral, and arrow-hand clocks$-$paired with time related questions; and 2) $\textit{CalendarQA}$, which consists of yearly calendar images with questions ranging from commonly known dates (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Day) to computationally derived ones (e.g., the 100th or 153rd day of the year). We aim to analyse how MLLMs can perform visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference when presented with time-related visual data. Our evaluations show that despite recent advancements, reliably understanding time remains a significant challenge for MLLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Lost in Time: Clock and Calendar Understanding Challenges in Multimodal LLMs" investigates the capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to interpret time through visual representations, specifically focusing on analogue clocks and yearly calendars. The authors introduce a carefully curated dataset, which includes two main subsets: **ClockQA**, featuring diverse clock styles with time-related questions, and **CalendarQA**, showcasing yearly calendar images with questions around known and derived dates. The study aims to explore visual recognition, numerical reasoning, and temporal inference abilities of MLLMs when confronted with time-related data. Findings indicate that understanding time remains a substantial challenge for these models, despite advancements in the field. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy aspects contributing to its novelty and significance. Firstly, the authors address a largely overlooked aspect of multimodal learning—understanding time-related visual data—which is crucial for real-world applications. Additionally, the creation of the ClockQA and CalendarQA datasets is a valuable contribution to the research community, potentially accelerating the development of MLLMs' reasoning capabilities in interpreting temporal contexts. However, the paper also has notable limitations. While the investigation into clock and calendar understanding is relevant, the scope may be considered narrow when compared to broader issues facing MLLMs, such as overall context comprehension and abstract reasoning. Furthermore, the evaluation methodology could benefit from elaboration to ascertain the reliability and validity of the findings thoroughly. The challenges presented by MLLMs in understanding clocks and calendars may also be symptomatic of deeper foundational issues in model training, which the paper does not delve into extensively. Overall, the paper engages with an essential aspect of cognitive understanding in AI, and its findings could pave the way for future research aimed at enhancing temporal reasoning in MLLMs. However, due to its limited scope and somewhat cursory treatment of evaluation methodologies, the impact might not be as profound as initially suggested. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's novel approach and contribution to the field of MLLMs while acknowledging its limitations in scope and depth of analysis.

### Leveraging Hypernetworks and Learnable Kernels for Consumer Energy Forecasting Across Diverse Consumer Types
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05104v1)
- **Authors**: Muhammad Umair Danish, Katarina Grolinger
- **Abstract**: Consumer energy forecasting is essential for managing energy consumption and planning, directly influencing operational efficiency, cost reduction, personalized energy management, and sustainability efforts. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially LSTMs and transformers, have been greatly successful in the field of energy consumption forecasting. Nevertheless, these techniques have difficulties in capturing complex and sudden variations, and, moreover, they are commonly examined only on a specific type of consumer (e.g., only offices, only schools). Consequently, this paper proposes HyperEnergy, a consumer energy forecasting strategy that leverages hypernetworks for improved modeling of complex patterns applicable across a diversity of consumers. Hypernetwork is responsible for predicting the parameters of the primary prediction network, in our case LSTM. A learnable adaptable kernel, comprised of polynomial and radial basis function kernels, is incorporated to enhance performance. The proposed HyperEnergy was evaluated on diverse consumers including, student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, and a townhouse. Across all consumer types, HyperEnergy consistently outperformed 10 other techniques, including state-of-the-art models such as LSTM, AttentionLSTM, and transformer.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Leveraging Hypernetworks and Learnable Kernels for Consumer Energy Forecasting Across Diverse Consumer Types" introduces a novel forecasting strategy named HyperEnergy, which addresses the limitations of traditional deep learning models, such as LSTMs and transformers, in predicting energy consumption patterns among different consumer types. The authors identify that existing techniques often fail to effectively capture sudden variations and predominantly focus on single consumer demographics. HyperEnergy utilizes hypernetworks to dynamically generate parameters for a primary LSTM model, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to various consumer behaviors. Additionally, the integration of a learnable adaptable kernel, which combines polynomial and radial basis functions, further improves forecasting accuracy. The proposed approach was empirically validated across diverse user categories—student residences, standalone homes, homes with electric vehicle chargers, and townhouses—and consistently outperformed ten other forecasting techniques, including leading models in the field. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper's novelty stems from its innovative integration of hypernetworks with LSTM models, focusing on sustainability and individualized forecasting across diverse consumer segments. The concept of using learnable adaptable kernels to enhance performance is particularly noteworthy, as it allows for more dynamic responsiveness to varying energy usage patterns. This combination represents a significant advancement over existing deep learning approaches by addressing their inadequacies in multi-type consumer energy forecasting. #### Significance The significance of this research lies in its potential application in real-world energy management and sustainability efforts. By successfully modeling consumer energy usage across varied demographics, HyperEnergy can aid in the development of more efficient energy management systems that are tailored to different consumer characteristics. This can have substantive implications for operational efficiency and cost reduction in energy utilities, contributing positively to broader sustainability goals. #### Strengths - **Robust Methodological Framework**: The use of hypernetworks provides a strong foundation for parameter adaptation, enabling better performance across diverse consumer types. - **Extensive Evaluation**: Evaluating the model across varied user categories solidifies its applicability and emphasizes its practical relevance. - **Performance Benchmarking**: The consistent outperformance against state-of-the-art techniques showcases the method's effectiveness. #### Weaknesses - **Limited Exploration of Hypernetwork Mechanism**: While hypernetworks are utilized, the paper could better clarify how they enhance the model's adaptability and what specific attributes lead to improved performance. - **Scalability Concerns**: The real-world scalability of HyperEnergy in large-scale applications could be further investigated, particularly in terms of computational demands and adaptability. - **Model Transparency**: Further discussion on the interpretability of the model's forecasts is warranted, especially given the increasing demand for explainable AI in critical sectors like energy consumption. ### Conclusion Overall, "Leveraging Hypernetworks and Learnable Kernels for Consumer Energy Forecasting Across Diverse Consumer Types" contributes significantly to the field of energy forecasting by innovatively leveraging hypernetworks for enhanced performance across various consumer types. While the methodology and results are compelling, more exploration into the underlying mechanisms and practical considerations of scaling the approach could bolster its impact.

### Flexible and Efficient Grammar-Constrained Decoding
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05111v1)
- **Authors**: Kanghee Park, Timothy Zhou, Loris D'Antoni
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel Grammar-Constrained Decoding (GCD) algorithm aimed at enhancing the efficiency of generating structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) while adhering to specific syntactic rules defined by a context-free grammar (CFG). Current GCD methodologies have significant preprocessing time requirements, rendering them less practical for real-time applications. The authors propose a new GCD approach that achieves a substantial improvement in offline preprocessing speed—17.71 times faster than existing methods—without sacrificing the performance of online mask calculation. This advancement enables faster and more efficient generation of token sequences that comply with CFGs, which is crucial for applications requiring exact structural output, such as programming and data formatting. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The problem of ensuring output from LLMs aligns with CFG has been acknowledged in the field, but the paper introduces a significant technological advancement in preprocessing speed. The proposed algorithm showcases innovation in both theoretical and practical aspects of grammar-constrained generation. **Significance:** The ability to preprocess grammars rapidly enhances the viability of using LLMs for applications that necessitate strict syntax compliance.

### CodeSCM: Causal Analysis for Multi-Modal Code Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05150v1)
- **Authors**: Mukur Gupta, Noopur Bhatt, Suman Jana
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we propose CodeSCM, a Structural Causal Model (SCM) for analyzing multi-modal code generation using large language models (LLMs). By applying interventions to CodeSCM, we measure the causal effects of different prompt modalities, such as natural language, code, and input-output examples, on the model. CodeSCM introduces latent mediator variables to separate the code and natural language semantics of a multi-modal code generation prompt. Using the principles of Causal Mediation Analysis on these mediators we quantify direct effects representing the model's spurious leanings. We find that, in addition to natural language instructions, input-output examples significantly influence code generation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CodeSCM, a Structural Causal Model designed to analyze multi-modal code generation in large language models (LLMs). It employs causal analysis to examine how different prompt modalities—natural language, code, and input-output pairs—affect code generation outputs. By incorporating latent mediator variables, the study effectively disentangles the influences of natural language semantics from those of code. The authors apply Causal Mediation Analysis to quantify the model's direct effects and identify spurious leanings. Their findings reveal that, alongside natural language prompts, input-output examples play a significant role in shaping code generation outcomes. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the work lies in its application of causal analysis frameworks to the field of code generation using LLMs, which is not commonly explored in existing literature. The incorporation of latent mediator variables represents a sophisticated approach to understanding the intricacies of multi-modal prompts, setting the groundwork for further studies in this area. The study’s results, particularly regarding the notable impact of input-output examples, provide valuable insights for practitioners seeking to optimize code generation through effective prompting strategies. However, there are notable weaknesses. While the paper proposes a novel framework, it would benefit from a larger empirical validation across diverse model architectures and prompt types. The findings are based on a specific set of experiments; generalizability to other contexts and LLMs remains unaddressed. Additionally, while the causal mediation analysis is a powerful tool, the underlying assumptions may limit the applicability of the results. The paper could have delved deeper into the implications of spurious leanings within the generated code and how these might affect reliability and trust in LLM outputs. Overall, while CodeSCM contributes a fresh perspective and methodology within the realm of code generation, the need for broader validation and exploration of its implications detracts from its potential impact. Therefore, the paper scores an **8** for its innovation and relevance to the ongoing discourse on causal analysis in AI and programming. **Score: 8**

### Hummingbird: High Fidelity Image Generation via Multimodal Context Alignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05153v1)
- **Authors**: Minh-Quan Le, Gaurav Mittal, Tianjian Meng, A S M Iftekhar, Vishwas Suryanarayanan, Barun Patra, Dimitris Samaras, Mei Chen
- **Abstract**: While diffusion models are powerful in generating high-quality, diverse synthetic data for object-centric tasks, existing methods struggle with scene-aware tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Human-Object Interaction (HOI) Reasoning, where it is critical to preserve scene attributes in generated images consistent with a multimodal context, i.e. a reference image with accompanying text guidance query. To address this, we introduce Hummingbird, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given a multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference image while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes, such as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance. Hummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously optimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards to ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in relation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model to address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a multimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets. Benchmark experiments show Hummingbird outperforms all existing methods by achieving superior fidelity while maintaining diversity, validating Hummingbird's potential as a robust multimodal context-aligned image generator in complex visual tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper "Hummingbird: High Fidelity Image Generation via Multimodal Context Alignment" presents a novel approach to image generation that enhances diffusion models by integrating multimodal context, including both a reference image and its corresponding textual query. Recognizing the limitations of existing models in generating contextually relevant images for tasks like Visual Question Answering and Human-Object Interaction Reasoning, the authors propose Hummingbird, which maintains diversity and fidelity in generated images. Key innovations include the Multimodal Context Evaluator that balances Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards. This enables the model to create images that adhere closely to the scene attributes of the reference image while being influenced by the text query. The paper introduces a new benchmark using MME Perception and Bongard HOI datasets, demonstrating superior performance in fidelity while preserving diversity compared to existing methods. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper presents a significant advancement in multimodal image generation by directly addressing the challenges of maintaining scene attributes in generated images, particularly in the context of both visual and textual inputs. This dual focus on fidelity and diversity is a notable contribution that sets it apart from previous work in the field. **Methodological Strengths**:  - The introduction of the Multimodal Context Evaluator is a thoughtful method to quantify the balance between semantic accuracy and fidelity. - The benchmark formulation represents a proactive approach to assess model performance more comprehensively. **Empirical Results**: The rigorous benchmarking against existing methods, with claims of superior performance, adds credibility to the authors' claims. However, the adequacy of comparisons, especially regarding datasets and metrics, is not discussed in detail. **Weaknesses**:  - While the methodology is innovative, the paper could benefit from more extensive experimentation, including a broader perspective on computational efficiency and response time. - The evaluation could include qualitative assessments alongside quantitative metrics to better illustrate the generated image quality and diversity. - The real-world applicability and potential biases in multimodal contexts are not adequately addressed. **Potential Influence**: The successful implementation of Hummingbird could open new avenues for research in multimodal learning and applications that require fine-grained scene understanding. Its implications could extend to artificial intelligence systems in many practical fields, including robotics and autonomous systems. ### Conclusion and Score Taking into consideration the paper's innovative approach, methodological contributions, rigorous benchmarking, and potential impact, I would assign a score of **8**. This reflects a strong contribution with notable advances in the field, though there are areas where the authors could strengthen their findings, particularly in discussion around broader applicability and exhaustive evaluation metrics. **Score: 8**

### A Lightweight Method to Disrupt Memorized Sequences in LLM
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05159v1)
- **Authors**: Parjanya Prajakta Prashant, Kaustubh Ponkshe, Babak Salimi
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across many tasks yet risk reproducing copyrighted content verbatim, raising legal and ethical concerns. Although methods like differential privacy or neuron editing can reduce memorization, they typically require costly retraining or direct access to model weights and may degrade performance. To address these challenges, we propose TokenSwap, a lightweight, post-hoc approach that replaces the probabilities of grammar-related tokens with those from a small auxiliary model (e.g., DistilGPT-2). We run extensive experiments on commercial grade models such as Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b and demonstrate that our method effectively reduces well-known cases of memorized generation by upto 10x with little to no impact on downstream tasks. Our approach offers a uniquely accessible and effective solution to users of real-world systems.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents TokenSwap, a novel method designed to mitigate the risk of large language models (LLMs) inadvertently generating memorized content, particularly copyrighted material. Traditional techniques such as differential privacy or neuron editing often require extensive retraining or access to model weights, potentially harming the model's performance. TokenSwap, however, is a lightweight, post-hoc method that substitutes probabilities of certain grammar-related tokens with those from a smaller auxiliary model, such as DistilGPT-2. This approach was validated through extensive experiments on two commercial models—Pythia-6.9b and LLaMA-3-8b—demonstrating a reduction in memorized generation instances by up to ten times with minimal impact on the models' overall performance in downstream tasks. TokenSwap stands out for its accessibility and efficiency, potentially making it a practical solution for users in real-world applications. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty (Score: 7/10)**   The proposed TokenSwap method is a reasonably innovative take on the challenge of mitigating memorization in LLMs. While existing approaches like differential privacy present effective means to address memorized outputs, they come with significant drawbacks, including high costs in computation and potential degradation in model capabilities. TokenSwap's emphasis on being a post-hoc, lightweight solution that does not require retraining or access to model internals contributes to its novelty. However, the concept of altering token probabilities based on auxiliary models is not entirely new; various watermarking and output modification techniques have explored similar strategies. While TokenSwap's specific implementation might be original, it resides within a broader context of attempts to control outputs from LLMs. This slightly decreases the originality score. **Significance** TokenSwap's practicality and low overhead make it particularly significant for real-world applications where stakeholders may be wary of legal ramifications from copyright violations. Its ability to reduce memorized content significantly—by up to a factor of ten—while maintaining performance on tasks is a notable advancement that many practitioners will find appealing. This feature is particularly crucial as LLMs become increasingly integrated into commercial products, where compliance and ethical considerations are paramount. **Strengths** 1. **Practical Application**: The method is easily applicable to existing models without major overhauls. 2. **Performance**: Effective reduction of memorization while preserving downstream performance is a commendable achievement. 3. **User Accessibility**: TokenSwap serves as an accessible tool for users who may lack extensive machine-learning expertise. **Weaknesses** 1. **Limited Scope**: The experiments conducted may not cover a diverse enough range of tasks and models to demonstrate the method's generalizability. 2. **Potential Trade-offs**: While the approach maintains performance, the long-term implications of altering token probabilities are not thoroughly discussed. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper presents a solid contribution to the field of LLM management concerning copyright adherence, promoting ethical AI usage without sacrificing performance. The innovative aspect lies in its practicality and effectiveness, contributing valuable perspectives to ongoing discussions in LLM deployment strategies. However, its relative incremental novelty when compared to existing research limits the score.  **Score: 7**

### DuoGuard: A Two-Player RL-Driven Framework for Multilingual LLM Guardrails
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05163v1)
- **Authors**: Yihe Deng, Yu Yang, Junkai Zhang, Wei Wang, Bo Li
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the need for guardrail models to ensure responsible use, particularly in detecting unsafe and illegal content. While substantial safety data exist in English, multilingual guardrail modeling remains underexplored due to the scarcity of open-source safety data in other languages. To address this gap, we propose a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where a generator and a guardrail model co-evolve adversarially to produce high-quality synthetic data for multilingual guardrail training. We theoretically formalize this interaction as a two-player game, proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical evaluations show that our model \ours outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving nearly 10% improvement over LlamaGuard3 (8B) on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a significantly smaller model (0.5B). We achieve substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks, particularly in addressing the imbalance for lower-resource languages in a collected real dataset. Ablation studies emphasize the critical role of synthetic data generation in bridging the imbalance in open-source data between English and other languages. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach to synthetic data generation, paving the way for improved multilingual guardrail models to enhance LLM safety. Code, model, and data will be open-sourced at https://github.com/yihedeng9/DuoGuard.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents DuoGuard, a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to enhance multilingual guardrails for large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight the challenge of ensuring responsible use of LLMs, particularly in detecting unsafe content in languages other than English, where there is a lack of safety data. To address this issue, DuoGuard utilizes an adversarial approach where a generator and a guardrail model evolve together to create high-quality synthetic data for training multilingual guardrails. The framework is theoretically grounded as a two-player game, achieving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. Empirical results indicate that DuoGuard demonstrates a nearly 10% performance improvement over existing models (LlamaGuard3) on English benchmarks while maintaining faster inference at a smaller model size. The approach notably enhances performance in multilingual safety tasks, especially for low-resource languages. The paper also underscores the significance of synthetic data generation in mitigating data imbalance across languages. The authors plan to make their code, model, and data publicly available. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of a two-player RL framework for guardrail modeling is innovative and provides a fresh perspective in a field that largely focuses on English-language models. This approach enhances the potential for generating synthetic safety data in multiple languages. 2. **Addressing a Significant Gap:** By focusing on multilingual safety and low-resource languages, the paper tackles an important shortcoming in the current landscape of LLM safety, which predominantly serves English. 3. **Theoretical and Empirical Validation:** The authors offer both theoretical grounding for their model and empirical validation, showing substantial gains in performance, particularly in multilingual contexts. This dual approach enhances the credibility of their findings. 4. **Open Source Commitment:** The commitment to open-source the code, model, and data promotes transparency and supports further research and development in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Validation:** While the theoretical convergence to Nash equilibrium is an important mathematical contribution, the practical implications and thorough validation of this component could have been elaborated. Clarifying these aspects can solidify the robustness of the proposed model. 2. **Limited Exploration of Adversarial Dynamics:** The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the dynamics between the generator and guardrails. Understanding how different adversarial interactions influence outcomes would be essential for users of the framework. 3. **Generality of Findings:** While the empirical results are promising, further validation across a broader range of languages and contexts is necessary to gauge the generality of the DuoGuard approach. Given the varying complexities of different languages, this could have significant implications for the framework’s applicability. 4. **Performance Benchmarks:** Although the paper claims improvement over LlamaGuard3, providing detailed performance benchmarks across various tasks and languages would enhance the validity of their claims. Overall, the paper presents a promising and meaningful advancement in the field of multilingual LLM safety, successfully addressing an underrepresented area with innovative methodologies. The strengths of DuoGuard align well with ongoing needs in AI safety and multilingual applications, but further exploration and validation across diverse scenarios will be necessary for full impact. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution due to the novelty of the approach and its significant potential impact on multilingual LLM safety, while also acknowledging the need for deeper validation and exploration of certain aspects to fully harness its advantages.

### In-context denoising with one-layer transformers: connections between attention and associative memory retrieval
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05164v1)
- **Authors**: Matthew Smart, Alberto Bietti, Anirvan M. Sengupta
- **Abstract**: We introduce in-context denoising, a task that refines the connection between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, also known as modern Hopfield networks. Using a Bayesian framework, we show theoretically and empirically that certain restricted denoising problems can be solved optimally even by a single-layer transformer. We demonstrate that a trained attention layer processes each denoising prompt by performing a single gradient descent update on a context-aware DAM energy landscape, where context tokens serve as associative memories and the query token acts as an initial state. This one-step update yields better solutions than exact retrieval of either a context token or a spurious local minimum, providing a concrete example of DAM networks extending beyond the standard retrieval paradigm. Overall, this work solidifies the link between associative memory and attention mechanisms first identified by Ramsauer et al., and demonstrates the relevance of associative memory models in the study of in-context learning.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents the concept of **in-context denoising**, which elucidates the relationship between attention-based architectures and dense associative memory (DAM) networks, notably modern Hopfield networks. Utilizing a Bayesian framework, the authors show that specific restricted denoising tasks can be effectively tackled using a single-layer transformer model. Their empirical evidence indicates that the attention layer can refine denoising prompts by performing a single gradient descent update on an energy landscape dictated by context-aware DAM. Context tokens function as associative memories while the query token sets the initial state for processing. This update mechanism allows for superior outcomes compared to retrieving context tokens directly or settling for spurious local minima. The findings reinforce earlier connections between associative memory theories and attention models, highlighting the broader implications of DAM networks beyond traditional retrieval methodologies.  ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper is innovative as it bridges two significant concepts in machine learning: attention mechanisms and associative memory retrieval. By framing in-context learning through the lens of denoising and showing how single-layer transformers can yield optimal results, the authors contribute to a deeper understanding of neural network capacities that transcend conventional retrieval. This is an important step that could inspire further research into optimizing model architectures for specific tasks. **Significance:** The discussion on in-context denoising and the advancements made using a Bayesian approach opens up new avenues for research. It reassesses conventional approaches to memory and retrieval, potentially influencing how future models are designed. The theoretical insights can guide improvements in practical applications of deep learning models in natural language processing, image recognition, and more. **Strengths:** - The theoretical foundation and empirical validation provide a robust framework for the claims made. - Clear connections between different concepts reinforce the study’s impact on understanding attention mechanisms. - It creates opportunities for interdisciplinary application of DAM concepts in various domains. **Weaknesses:** - While focusing on single-layer transformers highlights a specific case, it may downplay the performance of deeper architectures that typically create more abstract and generalized representations. - The implications of this work for larger, multi-layered transformer architectures could be explored further, as it's not clear whether similar results would hold. - Limited discussion on practical implementations and scalability may pose questions regarding the applicability of findings in real-world scenarios. **Potential Influence:** The paper offers a fresh perspective on how attention and associative memory can be combined in model training, potentially paving the way for more efficient and versatile architectures. However, its direct impact will depend on subsequent studies validating and building upon these findings. **Score:** 8 This score reflects a significant contribution to the field due to the originality of the concept and its theoretical rigor, although some limitations in applicability and depth of exploration prevent it from being rated as an exceptional contribution. The insights could lead to substantial revisions in existing models but require further investigation to fully realize their implications.

### NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167v1)
- **Authors**: Ali Modarressi, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck Dernoncourt, Trung Bui, Ryan A. Rossi, Seunghyun Yoon, Hinrich Schütze
- **Abstract**: Recent large language models (LLMs) support long contexts ranging from 128K to 1M tokens. A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a "needle" (relevant information) from a "haystack" (long irrelevant context). Extensions of this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context reasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal matches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this, we introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed needle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring models to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack. We evaluate 12 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K tokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades significantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 10 models drop below 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the top-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect baseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the increased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when literal matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces NoLiMa, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) that utilize long contexts—ranging from 128K to 1M tokens—by modifying the traditional needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test. This benchmark addresses limitations in existing evaluation methodologies that allow models to rely on literal matches between the "needle" (relevant information) and the "haystack" (long irrelevant context). NoLiMa features a carefully curated set of questions and needles with minimal lexical overlap, compelling models to derive latent associations rather than depend on surface similarities for information retrieval. Testing 12 popular LLMs, the research reveals a significant performance decline in long-context retrieval, with many models dropping below 50% accuracy at a context length of 32K. Notably, even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, show diminished effectiveness, illustrating challenges posed by attention mechanisms in handling extensive contexts without literal matches. ### Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty**: The paper presents a substantial advancement in the evaluation of LLMs, particularly regarding their handling of long contexts. Previous benchmarks failed to account for the potential reliance on literal matches, which NoLiMa effectively mitigates. By doing so, it initiates a more rigorous assessment of LLM capabilities, addressing a critical gap in the research methodology surrounding LLM evaluation. **Significance**: The introduction of NoLiMa could have significant implications for future LLM research and development, as it challenges models to enhance their inference and reasoning capabilities. This is particularly relevant given the real-world applications of LLMs in scenarios requiring deep contextual understanding, such as legal or medical texts. The authors' observations on performance degradation also highlight limitations in current model designs, thus encouraging further exploration and improvement in LLM architectures. **Strengths**: - The benchmark's design effectively isolates the models' ability to infer latent associations, providing a more nuanced understanding of model capabilities. - The extensive evaluation of multiple LLMs adds robustness to the findings and underscores the widespread challenges faced in long-context settings. **Weaknesses**: - The paper does not delve into solutions or recommendations for improving model performance on long-context retrieval. While it identifies a problem, offering potential strategies or directions for development could enhance the work's impact. - The discussion lacks a comprehensive investigation into why specific models excel or struggle under the new benchmarks, limiting the transferability of insights to model design. In summary, NoLiMa introduces a vital tool for assessing LLM performance in long-context situations, revealing weaknesses that need to be addressed for future advancements. Its emphasis on latent association inference is particularly timely given the current trajectory of LLM research. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to the field, its innovative approach to benchmarking, and the critical insights it provides into the limitations of existing models. However, the lack of depth in exploring solutions or detailed performance explanations prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Still, NoLiMa stands as an influential step forward in evaluating the true capabilities of LLMs.

### Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach

- **Authors**: Jonas Geiping, Sean McLeish, Neel Jain, John Kirchenbauer, Siddharth Singh, Brian R. Bartoldson, Bhavya Kailkhura, Abhinav Bhatele, Tom Goldstein
- **Abstract**: We study a novel language model architecture that is capable of scaling test-time computation by implicitly reasoning in latent space. Our model works by iterating a recurrent block, thereby unrolling to arbitrary depth at test-time. This stands in contrast to mainstream reasoning models that scale up compute by producing more tokens. Unlike approaches based on chain-of-thought, our approach does not require any specialized training data, can work with small context windows, and can capture types of reasoning that are not easily represented in words. We scale a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion parameters and 800 billion tokens. We show that the resulting model can improve its performance on reasoning benchmarks, sometimes dramatically, up to a computation load equivalent to 50 billion parameters.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach" introduces an innovative language model architecture designed to enhance test-time computation through implicit reasoning in latent space. The authors propose a recurrent block mechanism that allows for unrolling to arbitrary depths during inference, as opposed to existing models that typically scale by generating more output tokens. This architecture can operate without the need for extensive specialized training data and is effective with small context windows; it offers a unique capability to capture reasoning that may not be easily articulated in language.

- **Abstract**: We introduce Quantized Language-Image Pretraining (QLIP), a visual tokenization method that combines state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with state-of-the-art zero-shot image understanding. QLIP trains a binary-spherical-quantization-based autoencoder with reconstruction and language-image alignment objectives. We are the first to show that the two objectives do not need to be at odds. We balance the two loss terms dynamically during training and show that a two-stage training pipeline effectively mixes the large-batch requirements of image-language pre-training with the memory bottleneck imposed by the reconstruction objective. We validate the effectiveness of QLIP for multimodal understanding and text-conditioned image generation with a single model. Specifically, QLIP serves as a drop-in replacement for the visual encoder for LLaVA and the image tokenizer for LlamaGen with comparable or even better performance. Finally, we demonstrate that QLIP enables a unified mixed-modality auto-regressive model for understanding and generation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces Quantized Language-Image Pretraining (QLIP), a novel visual tokenization approach that aims to enhance both the quality of image reconstruction and zero-shot image understanding. The authors propose a binary-spherical-quantization-based autoencoder that utilizes dual objectives: reconstruction and language-image alignment. A key finding of their research is that these objectives can be harmonized rather than conflicting, which is achieved by dynamically balancing the loss terms during training. They implement a two-stage training pipeline to address the challenges posed by large-batch requirements typical in image-language pre-training and the memory constraints associated with the reconstruction task. The effectiveness of QLIP is further validated across multimodal understanding tasks and text-conditioned image generation, serving as a replacement for components in existing models like LLaVA and LlamaGen while demonstrating comparable or superior performance. Ultimately, QLIP is positioned as a unified model for mixed-modality auto-regressive tasks in understanding and generation. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation #### Novelty and Contribution QLIP presents a significant innovation in multimodal learning by successfully integrating high-quality visual tokenization with effective language-image alignment, which has traditionally been approached as a trade-off. The dynamic balancing of loss terms is noteworthy, as existing methods often face issues with resolving competing objectives during training. The proposed two-stage training strategy showcases a pragmatic solution to memory constraints while maintaining necessary performance levels, evidencing a thoughtful approach to bridging theoretical advances with practical application. #### Strengths 1. **Integration of Objectives:** The ability to unify reconstruction quality with zero-shot learning through a single model is a notable contribution that can streamline multimodal systems and reduce the complexity of training individual components. 2. **Performance Validation:** The paper provides strong empirical evidence for the efficacy of QLIP, particularly its application in well-regarded models like LLaVA and LlamaGen. This real-world applicability enhances the significance of the findings. 3. **Unified Implementation:** By offering a singular framework for both understanding and generation, QLIP potentially simplifies the deployment of multimodal models, distinguishing it from existing methods that treat these tasks separately. #### Weaknesses 1. **Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper claims robust performance, a more extensive comparison across a wider variety of datasets and tasks would strengthen the argument for the model's generalizability and robustness. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed method, particularly with its dual-loss objectives and two-stage training, may introduce complexities that could limit adoption in less resource-intensive environments or among practitioners with limited expertise. 3. **Limited Novelty in Tokenization Techniques:** While the vision of integrating language and image modalities is innovative, the underlying techniques of binary spherical quantization may not provide a sufficiently groundbreaking shift compared to other state-of-the-art tokenization methods. #### Overall Impact The introduction of QLIP in the context of advancing multimodal understanding and generation is significant, particularly for researchers and practitioners in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. By addressing long-standing challenges in training auto-regressive multimodal models, QLIP could pave the way for future research and applications in multimodal AI. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to addressing key challenges in multimodal frameworks, while also noting opportunities for broader evaluations and simplifications that could enhance its appeal within the community.

- **Abstract**: DiT diffusion models have achieved great success in text-to-video generation, leveraging their scalability in model capacity and data scale. High content and motion fidelity aligned with text prompts, however, often require large model parameters and a substantial number of function evaluations (NFEs). Realistic and visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution outputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage DiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage framework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs across stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage, prompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process utilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational efficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high resolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs. Quantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves state-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational efficiency. Additionally, the two-stage design enables users to preview the initial output before committing to full resolution generation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs and wait times as well as enhancing commercial viability .
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "FlashVideo: Flowing Fidelity to Detail for Efficient High-Resolution Video Generation" addresses challenges in high-resolution video generation using DiT diffusion models. While these models have successfully produced text-to-video outputs with notable content and motion fidelity, they often demand significant computational resources due to their size and the complexity of generating detailed visuals in high resolutions.  To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce a two-stage framework named FlashVideo. The first stage focuses on prompt fidelity using a low-resolution generation process, employing large model parameters and sufficient function evaluations (NFEs) to enhance computational efficiency. In the second stage, the framework matches the lower resolution outputs with higher ones, refining fine details while minimizing the NFEs required. This approach allows for state-of-the-art high-resolution video generation that is computationally efficient. Moreover, the two-stage design enables user previews of initial outputs, thus reducing computational costs and rendering times, enhancing its practical applicability in commercial settings. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The contribution of FlashVideo is twofold. Firstly, it introduces a novel two-stage method for video generation that diverges from the prevailing single-stage approaches which often sacrifice efficiency for detail. While single-stage models have dominated recent advancements, the FlashVideo framework strategically balances efficiency with output fidelity, which is a refreshing take in the field.  Secondly, the ability to preview results significantly enhances user experience and operational efficiency, tapping into an area that has not been adequately addressed by prior models. This user-centric feature could have substantial implications for the commercial viability of video generation technologies, making the framework more attractive for potential end-users. **Strengths:** - **Efficiency:** The authors effectively reduce computational requirements without compromising quality, addressing a critical limitation in high-resolution video generation. - **Practical Application:** The preview feature could improve decision-making in production environments, thereby increasing the usability of the technology. - **Performance Metrics:** The paper presents quantitative and qualitative results that support the claims of better performance over existing models. **Weaknesses:** - **Generalizability:** While the two-stage approach seems effective, it would be useful to examine its applicability across a broader range of scenarios and types of content. The methods may have limitations when faced with diverse and complex inputs that require nuanced interpretations. - **Complexity:** Introducing a two-stage system adds complexity. The paper does not adequately address how this complexity might affect the learning curve for new users or how it might be implemented in existing infrastructures. - **Evaluation Metrics:** While the paper claims state-of-the-art results, additional comparative analysis against various benchmarks versus recent models could strengthen its claims. ### Conclusion Overall, while "FlashVideo" presents significant advancements in the field of video generation, particularly by addressing efficiency and detail generation, it remains to be seen how adaptable and robust these innovations are across different applications. The two-stage approach is valuable, but the practical implications of its complexity and broader applicability should be considered. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution, particularly in a critical area of efficiency versus detail in video generation, but acknowledges some concerns regarding generalizability and usability that could limit its immediate impact.
