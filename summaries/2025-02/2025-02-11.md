- **Authors**: Gian Marco Orlando, Valerio La Gatta, Diego Russo, Vincenzo Moscato
- **Abstract**: Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) is an emerging simulation paradigm that combines the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models with traditional Agent-Based Modeling to replicate complex social behaviors, including interactions on social media. While prior work has focused on localized phenomena such as opinion formation and information spread, its potential to capture global network dynamics remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analyzing GABM-based social media simulations through the lens of the Friendship Paradox (FP), a counterintuitive phenomenon where individuals, on average, have fewer friends than their friends. We propose a GABM framework for social media simulations, featuring generative agents that emulate real users with distinct personalities and interests. Using Twitter datasets on the US 2020 Election and the QAnon conspiracy, we show that the FP emerges naturally in GABM simulations. Consistent with real-world observations, the simulations unveil a hierarchical structure, where agents preferentially connect with others displaying higher activity or influence. Additionally, we find that infrequent connections primarily drive the FP, reflecting patterns in real networks. These findings validate GABM as a robust tool for modeling global social media phenomena and highlight its potential for advancing social science by enabling nuanced analysis of user behavior.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the applicability of Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) in simulating social media dynamics, specifically examining the Friendship Paradox (FP) phenomenon. GABM synergizes the capabilities of Large Language Models with traditional agent-based approaches to produce complex social interactions. Previous studies on GABM have predominantly focused on localized behavioral patterns, but this research explores its efficacy in capturing broader network dynamics relevant to social media platforms. Utilizing agent simulations that mimic real users with varied personalities and interests, the study analyzes Twitter data from the US 2020 Election and QAnon conspiracy discussions. Findings indicate that the FP—where individuals have fewer friends than their friends on average—emerges within the simulations. Structurally, simulated networks exhibit a hierarchy where agents align themselves with those possessing greater activity or influence, and the formation of infrequent connections is identified as a primary driver of the FP. The results suggest that GABM is a valuable methodology for examining global social media behavior, enabling advanced insights into user interactions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a novel framework in the form of GABM, integrating generative modeling with agent-based approaches to address a complex social phenomenon. The investigation of the Friendship Paradox in simulations offers a fresh perspective on social media interactions, which is a critical area of inquiry given the pervasive influence of platforms like Twitter on societal dynamics. By merging LLM capabilities with traditional modeling, the study pushes the boundaries of conventional agent-based modeling and expands the toolkit available to social scientists for understanding real-world phenomena. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The GABM framework is a significant advancement in simulation methodologies, showcasing the integration of language model capabilities to enhance agent realism and behavioral diversity.  2. **Empirical Validation:** The study's use of credible datasets from the US 2020 Election and QAnon conspiracy lends validity and relevance to the findings, as these represent key contemporary social issues. 3. **Insights into Global Dynamics:** By observing the FP and associated hierarchical structures emerging in the simulations, the paper contributes valuable insights into social network dynamics which could inform strategies for public engagement and information dissemination. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** While the paper successfully demonstrates the emergence of the FP, it could benefit from exploring how different parameters or variations in agent characteristics (e.g., different sociocultural backgrounds) influence results. 2. **Generalizability of Findings:** The focus on Twitter limits the assessment of the framework's applicability across diverse social media platforms with different interaction norms and user demographics.  3. **Potential Overemphasis on Agent Realism:** While realistic user representation is crucial, the dependence on LLMs may introduce unintended biases or limitations given their training data and inherent biases.  **Potential Influence:** This study could influence the field by establishing GABM as a preferred method for social network analysis, potentially leading to further developments in modeling social phenomena. However, the limitations surrounding generalizability and the depth of exploration necessitate careful consideration before this approach gains widespread adoption in empirical work. **Score: 7** The score reflects the paper's significant contributions to the understanding of social media dynamics through an innovative modeling framework while recognizing the limitations in scope and potential generalizability. The findings are informative and position GABM as a valuable tool, but further exploration and validation across varied contexts would enhance its impact.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05931v1)
- **Authors**: Ahmed Abdelaziz, Ahmed Fathi, Ahmed Fares
- **Abstract**: EEG-based neural networks, pivotal in medical diagnosis and brain-computer interfaces, face significant intellectual property (IP) risks due to their reliance on sensitive neurophysiological data and resource-intensive development. Current watermarking methods, particularly those using abstract trigger sets, lack robust authentication and fail to address the unique challenges of EEG models. This paper introduces a cryptographic wonder filter-based watermarking framework tailored for EEG-based neural networks. Leveraging collision-resistant hashing and public-key encryption, the wonder filter embeds the watermark during training, ensuring minimal distortion ($\leq 5\%$ drop in EEG task accuracy) and high reliability (100\% watermark detection). The framework is rigorously evaluated against adversarial attacks, including fine-tuning, transfer learning, and neuron pruning. Results demonstrate persistent watermark retention, with classification accuracy for watermarked states remaining above 90\% even after aggressive pruning, while primary task performance degrades faster, deterring removal attempts. Piracy resistance is validated by the inability to embed secondary watermarks without severe accuracy loss ( $>10\%$ in EEGNet and CCNN models). Cryptographic hashing ensures authentication, reducing brute-force attack success probabilities. Evaluated on the DEAP dataset across models (CCNN, EEGNet, TSception), the method achieves $>99.4\%$ null-embedding accuracy, effectively eliminating false positives. By integrating wonder filters with EEG-specific adaptations, this work bridges a critical gap in IP protection for neurophysiological models, offering a secure, tamper-proof solution for healthcare and biometric applications. The framework's robustness against adversarial modifications underscores its potential to safeguard sensitive EEG models while maintaining diagnostic utility.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper addresses the intellectual property (IP) challenges faced by EEG-based neural networks, crucial in medical diagnostics and brain-computer interfaces. Current watermarking techniques are inadequate in providing strong authentication for these models. To resolve this, the authors propose a novel cryptographic wonder filter-based watermarking framework specifically designed for EEG neural networks. This framework utilizes collision-resistant hashing and public-key encryption to embed a watermark during the network training process. It ensures only a minimal accuracy drop (≤ 5%) and achieves 100% watermark detection reliability. The authors rigorously test the framework against various adversarial attacks like fine-tuning and pruning, showing that classification accuracy remains above 90% post-watermarking, while the watermark persists despite attempts to remove it. The technology resists piracy, revealing that embedding secondary watermarks leads to significant accuracy loss (> 10%). The methodology is validated on the DEAP dataset, showcasing a null-embedding accuracy exceeding 99.4%, minimizing false positives, and providing robust authentication against brute-force attempts. Overall, this work presents significant advancements in safeguarding EEG models, ensuring both candidacy for real-world applications in healthcare and retention of diagnostic capabilities. ### Evaluation #### Novelty and Significance The paper introduces a focused and needed solution for a pressing issue in the field of neurophysiological data and IP protection. It tackles the inadequacies of existing watermarking methods which do not cater to the specifics of EEG data, highlighting both theoretical innovation and practical implications. The integration of cryptographic methods with a focus on EEG models is a novel approach that appears to fill a significant lacuna in the current discourse on neural networks and IP security.  #### Strengths 1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of cryptographic hashing for watermarking specifically tailored for EEG models is novel and relevant, distinguishing it from prior works. 2. **Rigorous Testing**: The experimental evaluations against various adversarial attacks lend credibility to the robustness of the proposed framework. 3. **High Performance and Reliability**: Achieving high watermark detection rates and maintaining classification accuracy establishes reliability, which is essential for medical applications. #### Weaknesses 1. **Limited Scope of Application**: While the focus on EEG neural networks adds specificity, the paper could benefit from discussing how this method might adapt to other neural network types or datasets. 2. **Experimental Constraints**: The reliance on only the DEAP dataset may limit generalizability across broader neural network applications or different domains. 3. **Practical Implementation Challenges**: Although the methodology is theoretically sound, practical consideration of the implementation in real-world systems could enhance its applicability. #### Overall Influence The research holds significant implications for protecting sensitive neurophysiological data, with potential applications in both healthcare and biometric fields, which are increasingly critical. By addressing IP concerns, the framework has the potential to influence future research and application designs markedly. Given the innovative methodology, rigorous evaluations, and pertinent implications within its domain, the paper stands out as a meaningful contribution that could guide future developments in IP protection for neural networks. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a high level of novelty and significance owing to its unique contributions, though tempered by considerations regarding the scope of application and the need for broader validation.

### Learning to Substitute Words with Model-based Score Ranking
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05933v1)
- **Authors**: Hongye Liu, Ricardo Henao
- **Abstract**: Smart word substitution aims to enhance sentence quality by improving word choices; however current benchmarks rely on human-labeled data. Since word choices are inherently subjective, ground-truth word substitutions generated by a small group of annotators are often incomplete and likely not generalizable. To circumvent this issue, we instead employ a model-based score (BARTScore) to quantify sentence quality, thus forgoing the need for human annotations. Specifically, we use this score to define a distribution for each word substitution, allowing one to test whether a substitution is statistically superior relative to others. In addition, we propose a loss function that directly optimizes the alignment between model predictions and sentence scores, while also enhancing the overall quality score of a substitution. Crucially, model learning no longer requires human labels, thus avoiding the cost of annotation while maintaining the quality of the text modified with substitutions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms both masked language models (BERT, BART) and large language models (GPT-4, LLaMA). The source code is available at https://github.com/Hyfred/Substitute-Words-with-Ranking.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Learning to Substitute Words with Model-based Score Ranking" addresses the challenge of smart word substitution in text, which enhances sentence quality through better word choices. Traditional benchmarks rely on subjective human annotations that often lead to incomplete and non-generalizable data. The authors propose a novel strategy that employs a model-based scoring mechanism, specifically BARTScore, to assess sentence quality without requiring human labeled data. By defining a statistical distribution for word substitutions based on this score, the method aims to determine superior replacements quantitatively. Furthermore, the authors introduce a loss function geared toward optimizing the correlation between predicted substitutions and the associated sentence scores, ultimately improving substitution quality. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance over existing models such as BERT, BART, GPT-4, and LLaMA in experimental settings. The source code for their approach is available on GitHub. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper rests in its method of leveraging a model-based scoring system to replace the need for human annotations in word substitution tasks. This approach is significant as it can potentially streamline word substitution in natural language processing applications by using a scalable and efficient scoring system while overcoming the subjective limitations of human-labeled datasets. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Methodology:** The authors provide a clear shift from traditional human-annotated metrics to a fully model-based evaluation criterion. This not only enhances operational efficiency but also introduces a level of adaptability to varying text types. 2. **Performance Gains:** The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses several existing models in quality. Such empirical validation strengthens the paper's claims and adds credibility to the technique. 3. **Open Source Contribution:** The availability of the code on GitHub encourages further research and practical applications, which could nurture community engagement and validation of the work. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependency on Model Quality:** The proposed method’s performance hinges on the inherent quality of BARTScore. If this score model has limitations, the efficacy of the substitutions proposed could also be compromised. 2. **Lack of Broader Contextual Evaluation:** While the results against specific models are promising, there is limited scope provided on how this approach performs in more diverse textual contexts. Future studies could enhance external validity. 3. **Limited Insight into Subjectivity Across Domains:** Although the paper acknowledges the subjectivity of word choices, it doesn't fully explore how this method might handle substitutions across various genres or functional styles of writing. In light of these considerations, the paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of natural language processing through its innovative mechanism for smart word substitution. Despite its limitations, the work has strong implications for reducing reliance on human annotations in the development of NLP models. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05944v1)
- **Authors**: Jackson Coleman, Isaiah Lawrence, Benjamin Turner
- **Abstract**: Multi-source multi-hop question answering (QA) represents a challenging task in natural language processing due to the need for dynamic integration of heterogeneous knowledge sources and multi-step reasoning. Existing methods often suffer from cascading errors, insufficient handling of knowledge conflicts, and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Multi-source Knowledge-Oriented Reasoning (AMKOR), a generative framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically fuse parametric and retrieved knowledge while exploring reasoning trajectories using probabilistic beam reasoning. AMKOR is further enhanced by a multi-granular learning strategy, optimizing both local reasoning steps and global answer accuracy. Experiments conducted on four widely-used multi-hop QA datasets, including HotpotQA and MuSiQue, demonstrate that AMKOR achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods on both reasoning accuracy and robustness. Additional analyses confirm its scalability, adaptability to noisy knowledge, and superior ability to handle complex multi-hop tasks. This work establishes a new benchmark for multi-source multi-hop QA by effectively combining reasoning quality and efficiency.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper presents Adaptive Multi-source Knowledge-Oriented Reasoning (AMKOR), a novel framework designed to tackle the challenges posed by multi-source multi-hop question answering (QA). AMKOR innovatively integrates large language models (LLMs) to merge parametric and retrieved knowledge, facilitating multi-step reasoning through a probabilistic beam reasoning approach. Furthermore, it incorporates a multi-granular learning strategy that optimizes local reasoning steps while ensuring overall answer accuracy. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue, showing improvements in reasoning accuracy and robustness against noise and knowledge discrepancies. Overall, the work not only enhances the reasoning quality but also establishes a new benchmark in the field of multi-source multi-hop QA. **Critical Evaluation:**   The novelty of the AMKOR framework lies in its sophisticated approach to multi-granular training strategies, which combine the strengths of LLMs with probabilistic reasoning methods. The paper addresses significant limitations in existing methods, such as the propensity for cascading errors and the inefficiencies of integrating heterogeneous knowledge sources. By leveraging a dynamic fusion of parametric and retrieved knowledge, the research makes a meaningful contribution to enhancing multi-hop reasoning capabilities. The methodology is robust, and the experimental results are persuasive, indicating AMKOR outperforms existing benchmarks not only in accuracy but also in handling noisy data. This aspect is particularly valuable given the real-world implications of information retrieval and QA where data may often be incomplete or inaccurate. However, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the limitations of AMKOR and comparisons with other emerging methodologies that also aim for multi-hop reasoning. While the results are compelling, additional analysis of computational overhead and time efficiency relative to baseline models could further substantiate claims about its practical applicability.  The significance of the work is reinforced by the establishment of a new benchmark in multi-source multi-hop QA, which could guide future research in the field. This contribution is substantial, as it addresses pressing challenges faced by researchers. In summary, given the innovative approach, strong results, and the establishment of new benchmarks, I would assign a score of 8. The paper is indeed a noteworthy advancement in the field but would be greatly strengthened by an even more thorough discussion of limitations and potential future work.  **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Zhendong Zhang
- **Abstract**: Multiple heads decoding accelerates the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) by predicting next several tokens simultaneously. It generates and verifies multiple candidate sequences in parallel via tree attention with a fixed structure. In this paper, we replace the fixed tree attention with dynamic tree attention on multiple head decoding, specifically in the context of MEDUSA. We propose a simple and low complexity strategy to generate candidates and construct the dynamic tree structure. Preliminary experiments show that the proposed method improves the decoding efficiency of multiple head decoding for LLMs while maintaining the generation quality. This result demonstrates the potential for improvement of multiple head decoding in candidate generation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Acceleration Multiple Heads Decoding for LLM via Dynamic Tree Attention" explores enhancing the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference through a technique called multiple heads decoding, which allows for the simultaneous prediction of several tokens. The authors argue that the conventional use of a fixed tree attention structure for generating candidate sequences can be improved. They introduce a dynamic tree attention mechanism tailored for multiple head decoding within the MEDUSA framework. Their approach involves a straightforward, low-complexity method for candidate generation and tree structure construction. Preliminary experiments indicate that this dynamic adaptation significantly enhances decoding efficiency without compromising the quality of the generated sequences. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel approach to improve the efficiency of multiple heads decoding in LLMs, a topic of increasing relevance given the growing size and complexity of these models. The introduction of dynamic tree attention as a replacement for static structures is a meaningful advancement, particularly since the fixed structure can limit the flexible representation of candidate sequences. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: By moving from static to dynamic tree attention, the authors introduce variability and responsiveness in candidate generation, which is a notable enhancement over prior methodologies. 2. **Impact on Efficiency**: The focus on decoding efficiency addresses a critical bottleneck in LLM applications, potentially making these models more practical for real-time applications. 3. **Balancing Quality and Performance**: The results demonstrating improved efficiency while maintaining generation quality suggest a well-designed experimental framework that addresses key concerns in LLM performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Preliminary Nature of Experiments**: Although initial results are promising, they are described as preliminary. Comprehensive experiments, including benchmarks against existing methods across a wider range of datasets and tasks, would bolster the claims made. 2. **Complexity in Dynamic Structures**: While the proposed strategy is stated to be low in complexity, the practical implications of dynamically modifying tree structures during decoding may introduce unforeseen challenges or overhead that are not addressed in the paper. 3. **Limited Contextual Background**: The paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on the state-of-the-art in multiple head decoding techniques, contextualizing the significance and expected impact of the dynamic approach in a broader landscape. In the context of the growing need for efficient LLM implementations, this work presents a significant contribution. However, the preliminary results and lack of extensive validation limit its immediate applicability and acceptance in the field. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Antonio La Torre, Marco Angelini
- **Abstract**: This work introduces Cyri, an AI-powered conversational assistant designed to support a human user in detecting and analyzing phishing emails by leveraging Large Language Models. Cyri has been designed to scrutinize emails for semantic features used in phishing attacks, such as urgency, and undesirable consequences, using an approach that unifies features already established in the literature with others by Cyri features extraction methodology. Cyri can be directly plugged into a client mail or webmail, ensuring seamless integration with the user's email workflow while maintaining data privacy through local processing. By performing analyses on the user's machine, Cyri eliminates the need to transmit sensitive email data over the internet, reducing associated security risks. The Cyri user interface has been designed to reduce habituation effects and enhance user engagement. It employs dynamic visual cues and context-specific explanations to keep users alert and informed while using emails. Additionally, it allows users to explore identified malicious semantic features both through conversation with the agent and visual exploration, obtaining the advantages of both modalities for expert or non-expert users. It also allows users to keep track of the conversation, supports the user in solving additional questions on both computed features or new parts of the mail, and applies its detection on demand. To evaluate Cyri, we crafted a comprehensive dataset of 420 phishing emails and 420 legitimate emails. Results demonstrate high effectiveness in identifying critical phishing semantic features fundamental to phishing detection. A user study involving 10 participants, both experts and non-experts, evaluated Cyri's effectiveness and usability. Results indicated that Cyri significantly aided users in identifying phishing emails and enhanced their understanding of phishing tactics.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents Cyri, a conversational AI-based assistant aimed at helping users detect and analyze phishing emails. Utilizing Large Language Models, Cyri analyzes emails for semantic features indicative of phishing, such as urgency and negative consequences. The assistant is designed for seamless integration with existing email clients, ensuring data privacy through local processing that avoids the transmission of sensitive information. Its user interface prioritizes engagement by providing dynamic visual cues and context-specific explanations, empowering users—whether experts or novices—to better understand potential threats. Cyri allows users to explore phishing characteristics interactively and answers additional queries regarding analyzed emails. To validate its effectiveness, the authors constructed a dataset of 840 emails (420 phishing and 420 legitimate) and conducted a user study that demonstrated Cyri's capability to assist users in identifying phishing attempts and enhancing their awareness of phishing tactics. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** Cyri introduces an innovative integration of conversational AI in the specific domain of phishing email detection. While the use of AI in this area is not entirely new, the approach of combining user interaction through conversation with local processing for privacy is a noteworthy contribution. However, the foundational concepts are built on existing literature regarding semantic features of phishing emails, which somewhat limits the novelty although it does attempt to expand on it with unique features extraction methodologies.  **Significance:** The significance of the research lies in its potential to improve user awareness and safety regarding phishing attacks, which are a persistent threat in cybersecurity. The inclusion of user studies adds credibility to the claims that Cyri enhances user capability in recognizing phishing tactics. Still, the sample size (10 participants) limits the generalizability of findings. In terms of practical application, the integration with email systems could significantly enhance everyday user interactions with emails, provided user engagement remains high. **Strengths:** 1. **User-Centric Design:** The focus on user experience and engagement through dynamic visual aids is compelling.  2. **Privacy Consideration:** Addressing privacy through local processing shows a clear awareness of contemporary concerns surrounding data security. 3. **Interactivity:** The dual modality (conversation and visual exploration) is a thoughtful approach to accommodate various user preferences. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited User Study Sample:** A larger sample would improve the robustness of usability and effectiveness claims. 2. **Dependence on Existing Literature:** While the unification of features is beneficial, the reliance on previous work may reduce the perceived impact of the newly introduced methodologies. 3. **Scalability and Adaptability:** It would be beneficial to explore how Cyri adapts to evolving phishing techniques, which were not addressed in the current study. In summary, while Cyri presents an innovative approach aimed at phishing attack detection and user support, the overall novelty and impact are tempered by limitations in user study design, reliance on existing literature, and questions around adaptability.  **Score: 7**

### Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems in the Exponential Family
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05994v1)
- **Authors**: Alessandro Micheli, Mélodie Monod, Samir Bhatt
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for solving inverse problems, yet prior work has primarily focused on observations with Gaussian measurement noise, restricting their use in real-world scenarios. This limitation persists due to the intractability of the likelihood score, which until now has only been approximated in the simpler case of Gaussian likelihoods. In this work, we extend diffusion models to handle inverse problems where the observations follow a distribution from the exponential family, such as a Poisson or a Binomial distribution. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of exponential family distributions, we introduce the evidence trick, a method that provides a tractable approximation to the likelihood score. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methodology effectively performs Bayesian inference on spatially inhomogeneous Poisson processes with intensities as intricate as ImageNet images. Furthermore, we demonstrate the real-world impact of our methodology by showing that it performs competitively with the current state-of-the-art in predicting malaria prevalence estimates in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems in the Exponential Family" addresses the limitations of existing diffusion models in the context of inverse problems, particularly the reliance on Gaussian measurement noise. The authors introduce a novel methodology that extends diffusion models to inverse problems associated with observations from the exponential family, such as Poisson and Binomial distributions. By utilizing the conjugacy properties of these distributions, they propose the "evidence trick," which offers a tractable approximation for the likelihood score. The effectiveness of the methodology is validated through experiments on spatially inhomogeneous Poisson processes, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods in real-world applications, specifically in estimating malaria prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The novelty of the paper lies in its extension of diffusion models beyond Gaussian distributions, which have predominantly dominated the field. This shift opens new avenues for applying these models to a wider range of real-world problems characterized by different types of noise and distributional properties. **Significance**: The introduction of the evidence trick to approximate the intractable likelihood score presents a significant advancement.

- **Authors**: Rahul Porwal, Alice Rozet, Pryce Houck, Jotsna Gowda, Sarah Moeller, Kevin Tang
- **Abstract**: African American English (AAE) presents unique challenges in natural language processing (NLP). This research systematically compares the performance of available NLP models--rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs)--capable of identifying key grammatical features of AAE, namely Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. These features were selected for their distinct grammatical complexity and frequency of occurrence. The evaluation involved sentence-level binary classification tasks, using both zero-shot and few-shot strategies. The analysis reveals that while LLMs show promise compared to the baseline, they are influenced by biases such as recency and unrelated features in the text such as formality. This study highlights the necessity for improved model training and architectural adjustments to better accommodate AAE's unique linguistic characteristics. Data and code are available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** This paper investigates the capabilities of various NLP models, including rule-based, transformer-based, and large language models (LLMs), in tagging grammatical features of African American English (AAE), specifically focusing on Habitual Be and Multiple Negation. The study employed sentence-level binary classification tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning strategies. Results indicate that LLMs demonstrate superior performance relative to baseline models, although their effectiveness is hindered by biases tied to recency and unrelated text features, such as formality. The authors argue for enhancements in model training and architecture to better handle the grammatical intricacies of AAE. Furthermore, data and code associated with the research are made publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents a notable addition to the body of research examining the intersection of NLP and sociolinguistics, particularly regarding the processing of AAE. Its novelty stems from the systematic comparison of different models in addressing AAE's unique grammatical structures—a relatively underexplored area in NLP, which has historically marginalized non-standard dialects in computational linguistics. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The focus on AAE is timely and addresses significant gaps in NLP research, which often overlooks diverse linguistic forms. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** Employing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms enriches the analysis, demonstrating the versatility of different machine learning approaches. 3. **Data Sharing:** The availability of data and code enhances reproducibility and allows other researchers to build on this work, promoting further studies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Biases:** While the authors acknowledge biases in LLM performance, the report lacks an extensive examination of these biases and their implications, which could provide deeper insights into model limitations. 2. **Broader Context:** The paper could benefit from a more extensive literature review of previous works focusing on AAE or similar dialects, explicitly stating how it builds or diverges from existing research efforts. 3. **Generalizability:** The study's focus on Habitual Be and Multiple Negation, while valuable, may limit the findings' applicability to the broader spectrum of AAE grammatical structures. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper successfully brings attention to the NLP challenges surrounding AAE and proposes actionable improvements for LLMs. However, the analysis could have been enriched with a more in-depth exploration of model biases and a clearer context within prior research. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **Score: 7**. This reflects a solid contribution to the field, while acknowledging areas where further development could enhance its impact and applicability.

### Transformers versus the EM Algorithm in Multi-class Clustering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06007v1)
- **Authors**: Yihan He, Hong-Yu Chen, Yuan Cao, Jianqing Fan, Han Liu
- **Abstract**: LLMs demonstrate significant inference capacities in complicated machine learning tasks, using the Transformer model as its backbone. Motivated by the limited understanding of such models on the unsupervised learning problems, we study the learning guarantees of Transformers in performing multi-class clustering of the Gaussian Mixture Models. We develop a theory drawing strong connections between the Softmax Attention layers and the workflow of the EM algorithm on clustering the mixture of Gaussians. Our theory provides approximation bounds for the Expectation and Maximization steps by proving the universal approximation abilities of multivariate mappings by Softmax functions. In addition to the approximation guarantees, we also show that with a sufficient number of pre-training samples and an initialization, Transformers can achieve the minimax optimal rate for the problem considered. Our extensive simulations empirically verified our theory by revealing the strong learning capacities of Transformers even beyond the assumptions in the theory, shedding light on the powerful inference capacities of LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the performance of Transformers, particularly in the context of multi-class clustering using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). It investigates how Softmax Attention layers in Transformers relate to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm traditionally used for clustering. The authors establish theoretical foundations that demonstrate approximation capabilities of Softmax functions for EM steps, leading to minimax optimal convergence rates provided that enough pre-training samples and proper initialization are present. Empirical experiments support their theoretical claims, showcasing the Transformers' robust performance even beyond theoretical assumptions. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this study lies in its exploration of the interaction between modern deep learning architectures (Transformers) and classical unsupervised learning algorithms (EM). The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework that connects these two domains, which is intellectually significant as it draws parallels between contemporary model architectures and traditional statistical methods. This bridging can pave the way for new hybrid approaches that leverage strengths from both paradigms. One of the strengths of the paper is its robustness in both theoretical and empirical sections, affirming its claims with simulations that reinforce the proposed theory. Additionally, the focus on approximation guarantees adds depth to understanding Transformers' capacity beyond the commonly explored supervised learning contexts. However, the paper does have some weaknesses. Firstly, while the theoretical contributions are important, they may not be groundbreaking in terms of fundamentally changing how researchers approach multi-class clustering; instead, they present a correlation rather than a transformative new methodology. Secondly, the scope of empirical validation may need further extension to real-world datasets or applications, which could demonstrate practical relevance beyond simulations. In conclusion, while the paper provides valuable insights and reinforces the capability of Transformers in clustering tasks, it does not revolutionize the field or present new methodologies that fundamentally alter existing paradigms. As such, the contribution, while notable, is incremental in advancing current understanding and applications of Transformers. **Score: 7**

### Dual Caption Preference Optimization for Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06023v1)
- **Authors**: Amir Saeidi, Yiran Luo, Agneet Chatterjee, Shamanthak Hegde, Bimsara Pathiraja, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in human preference optimization, originally developed for Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown significant potential in improving text-to-image diffusion models. These methods aim to learn the distribution of preferred samples while distinguishing them from less preferred ones. However, existing preference datasets often exhibit overlap between these distributions, leading to a conflict distribution. Additionally, we identified that input prompts contain irrelevant information for less preferred images, limiting the denoising network's ability to accurately predict noise in preference optimization methods, known as the irrelevant prompt issue. To address these challenges, we propose Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO), a novel approach that utilizes two distinct captions to mitigate irrelevant prompts. To tackle conflict distribution, we introduce the Pick-Double Caption dataset, a modified version of Pick-a-Pic v2 with separate captions for preferred and less preferred images. We further propose three different strategies for generating distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Our experiments show that DCPO significantly improves image quality and relevance to prompts, outperforming Stable Diffusion (SD) 2.1, SFT_Chosen, Diffusion-DPO, and MaPO across multiple metrics, including Pickscore, HPSv2.1, GenEval, CLIPscore, and ImageReward, fine-tuned on SD 2.1 as the backbone.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach called Dual Caption Preference Optimization (DCPO) aimed at enhancing the performance of text-to-image diffusion models by addressing two significant challenges: overlapping preference distributions and the irrelevant prompt issue that hampers the denoising network's effectiveness. The authors introduce the Pick-Double Caption dataset, which differentiates captions for preferred and less preferred images, thus helping to alleviate conflicts in sample preferences. Additionally, they propose three strategies to generate distinct captions: captioning, perturbation, and hybrid methods. Their experiments reveal that DCPO leads to substantial improvements in image quality and relevance compared to existing methods, outperforming state-of-the-art models on various evaluation metrics. **Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates notable novelty by tackling two critical issues within the current methodology for optimizing human preferences in diffusion models. First, addressing the overlap in preference datasets and introducing tailored strategies to generate distinct captions is a significant advancement. The utilization of a modified dataset (Pick-Double Caption) designed specifically to segregate preferences represents a thoughtful and methodical approach to an identified problem. Moreover, the empirical results showcasing improvements over various benchmarks (including Stable Diffusion 2.1 and others) add weight to the paper's claims and underscore its potential impact in the field of generative models, particularly in visual content generation where alignment with human preferences is crucial. However, the paper's contribution may be limited in that it builds upon existing structures without introducing fundamentally new architectures for the diffusion models or a transformative innovation in the underlying technology. Additionally, while the reported improvements are significant, it would benefit from a deeper analysis of the complexities and trade-offs involved in implementing the proposed methods, which could bolster the understanding of their broader applicability. Finally, while the findings are promising, their real-world efficacy should be evaluated across diverse contexts and datasets beyond the experimental conditions laid out in the study. If this were addressed, it could further increase the robustness of the findings. **Rationale for Score:** Considering the innovative approach to a recognized challenge, the systematic method of experimentation, and the relevance of the findings to a hot area of research, I would assign the paper a score of 8. This score reflects its substantial contributions while recognizing certain limitations in the theoretical framework and practical applications. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Ziqi Chen, Bo Peng, Tianhua Zhai, Daniel Adu-Ampratwum, Xia Ning
- **Abstract**: Drug development is a critical but notoriously resource- and time-consuming process. In this manuscript, we develop a novel generative artificial intelligence (genAI) method DiffSMol to facilitate drug development. DiffSmol generates 3D binding molecules based on the shapes of known ligands. DiffSMol encapsulates geometric details of ligand shapes within pre-trained, expressive shape embeddings and then generates new binding molecules through a diffusion model. DiffSMol further modifies the generated 3D structures iteratively via shape guidance to better resemble the ligand shapes. It also tailors the generated molecules toward optimal binding affinities under the guidance of protein pockets. Here, we show that DiffSMol outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. When generating binding molecules resembling ligand shapes, DiffSMol with shape guidance achieves a success rate 61.4%, substantially outperforming the best baseline (11.2%), meanwhile producing molecules with novel molecular graph structures. DiffSMol with pocket guidance also outperforms the best baseline in binding affinities by 13.2%, and even by 17.7% when combined with shape guidance. Case studies for two critical drug targets demonstrate very favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of the generated molecules, thus, the potential of DiffSMol in developing promising drug candidates.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents DiffSMol, a generative artificial intelligence method designed to enhance the drug development process by generating 3D binding molecules that mimic known ligands’ shapes. By leveraging expressive shape embeddings and a diffusion model, DiffSMol iteratively modifies generated structures to align with desired ligand shapes and optimize binding affinities based on protein pockets. The study shows that DiffSMol significantly outperforms existing methods in generating binding molecules, achieving a success rate of 61.4% for shape resemblance and improving binding affinities by as much as 17.7% when combining shape and pocket guidance. Case studies highlight the promising physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of these generated molecules. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a compelling approach to drug development that integrates shape conditioning and diffusion models, which is a relatively novel application of generative AI in this field. The methodology of utilizing shape embeddings and iterative modifications is innovative and shows a clear advancement over traditional computational methods in drug design. The success metrics presented (61.4% success rate in producing shape-comparable molecules and improved binding affinity benchmarks) indicate that this technology has significant potential to influence the future of drug discovery.  **Strengths:** - The paper presents a well-structured methodology that combines two advanced concepts (diffusion models and shape conditioning) in a domain (drug discovery) that can benefit greatly from such innovations. - Comprehensive evaluation against state-of-the-art methods strengthens the validation of the proposed approach. - Case studies emphasize practical applications, showcasing the utility of generated compounds. **Weaknesses:** - While the results demonstrate superiority over existing methods, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the limitations and any potential biases in the datasets used for training and evaluation. - The paper heavily focuses on quantitative success metrics but could enhance its contribution by discussing the qualitative aspects of the generated compounds, such as potential toxicity, stability, and synthesis feasibility. - Potential challenges in scaling the diffusion model to a broader range of chemical space or integrating it into existing workflows in drug development could have been addressed in the discussion. **Potential Influence:** DiffSMol could represent a significant step towards more efficient drug development pathways if integrated into pharmaceutical research settings. The ability to generate novel binding molecules with favorable properties based on known ligands with various modifications exemplifies a robust tool for medicinal chemists. However, further validation in clinical or real-world settings would be necessary to ascertain practical relevance fully. **Score: 8** The score reflects an appreciation for the innovative combination of generative AI techniques applied to drug discovery, solid results against benchmarks, and promising case studies. It acknowledges the significant impact this research could have, balanced by the need for further exploration of certain limitations and contexts in which this technology could be applied.

- **Authors**: Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Bruno Ribeiro, Chaim Baskin, Moshe Eliasof
- **Abstract**: Pre-trained Vision Transformers now serve as powerful tools for computer vision. Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper "DiTASK: Multi-Task Fine-Tuning with Diffeomorphic Transformations" presents a new approach to adapting pre-trained Vision Transformers for multiple tasks without causing interference among them. The existing methods, like LoRA, utilize low-rank updates, which restrict tasks to competing in limited subspaces and can lead to suboptimal performance. In contrast, DiTASK employs diffeomorphic transformations on the singular values of the weight matrices to achieve task-specific adaptations that maintain the integrity of the pre-trained representations. The method achieves both shared and distinct feature modulations with fewer additional parameters, demonstrating full-rank updates and preserving the geometry of the original features during optimization. Experimental evaluations on public datasets like PASCAL MTL and NYUD indicate that DiTASK outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across various dense prediction tasks while using 75% fewer parameters. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** DiTASK's approach of using diffeomorphic transformations is a notable departure from traditional parameter-efficient methods in multi-task learning. By preserving the structure of hidden representations through the singular values of weight matrices, it addresses the critical challenge of interference among tasks more directly than previous methods. This strategy appears promising, especially in fields like computer vision, where pretrained models need to be adapted for various specific tasks. The focus on maintaining the geometric integrity of the pre-trained model contributes to its novelty. **Significance:** The significance of the research lies in its potential to streamline multi-task learning and improve performance with a reduced parameter budget, which is a pressing concern in deep learning applications. The empirical results showcasing state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks bolster the relevance of the proposed method. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** Introduces a novel mathematical treatment through diffeomorphic transformations that could inspire future research. 2. **Efficiency:** Demonstrates substantial parameter savings while achieving high performance metrics. 3. **Empirical Validation:** Strong experimental results reinforce the theoretical claims. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** While the mathematical formulation is elegant, the complexity of the transformations may limit practical application for non-expert practitioners. 2. **Generalization:** The paper primarily evaluates its method on a couple of datasets; broader validation could improve robustness claims. 3. **Comparison Limitations:** The paper lacks a thorough comparative analysis with a wider range of existing state-of-the-art techniques, particularly those that are also parameter-efficient. **Conclusion:** DiTASK proposes a method that clearly expands the toolbox for multi-task learning, potentially advancing the efficiency and effectiveness of adapting deep learning models. However, while the theoretical and empirical contributions are commendable, real-world application might require more simplicity and generalizability.  Based on these considerations, while DiTASK presents innovative contributions and shows clear advantages over existing methods, its complexity and limited evaluation context prevent it from achieving the highest impact score. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models" explores the reasoning capabilities of large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) compared to their ability to memorize patterns from training data. The authors define compositional reasoning in the context of forecasting and differentiate it from regular in-distribution generalization. They evaluate 23 popular forecasting models across various datasets, both synthetic and real-world, and conduct controlled studies to identify design choices that enhance reasoning capabilities in TSFMs. The findings reveal that patch-based Transformers achieve superior reasoning performance, while residualized MLP architectures offer a more computationally efficient alternative. The research also highlights that these models can perform better in zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios compared to traditional statistical methods. Key design choices, particularly tokenization methods, were found to adversely affect model performance.  **Evaluation:** This paper presents several strengths that highlight its significance and contribute to advancing the field of time series modeling.  1. **Novelty**: The investigation of compositional reasoning specifically within the context of time series forecasting is relatively unexplored, making this paper a timely contribution. The authors extend discussions from LLMs to TSFMs, framing the conversation about reasoning in a significant new area. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper employs a systematic approach to evaluate different forecasting models, which adds depth to the analysis. The combination of synthetic and real-world datasets strengthens the findings by showing practical relevancy. 3. **Insights on Design Choices**: The examination of which architectural choices influence reasoning capabilities is valuable for future research and design of TSFMs, thus offering practical implications for model development. 4. **Comparative Performance Analysis**: Highlighting how modern TSFMs can surpass traditional models in certain contexts is crucial for advancing the acceptance of ML models over established statistical techniques. However, there are also some weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the evaluation encompasses a variety of models, the study may benefit from a broader range of datasets and reasoning tasks, which could provide more generalizable insights. 2. **Neglected Factors**: While it investigates architectural parameters, other influencing factors like training regime, hyperparameter optimization, and model interpretability could have also been considered. 3. **Impact on the Field**: While the findings are significant, it is yet unclear how readily the insights will translate into practice or influence future research directions, especially given the fast-evolving nature of machine learning. Considering the balance of novelty, the depth of investigation, and potential implications for the field, the score is assigned as follows: **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the understanding of reasoning in TSFMs, while also acknowledging areas where the study could be expanded or deeper insights could be investigated. The work is likely to motivate further exploration into both reasoning capabilities and practical applications of TSFMs, thus influencing future research directions.

- **Abstract**: Prompt engineering reduces reasoning mistakes in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in mitigating vulnerabilities in LLM-generated code remains underexplored. To address this gap, we implemented a benchmark to automatically assess the impact of various prompt engineering strategies on code security. Our benchmark leverages two peer-reviewed prompt datasets and employs static scanners to evaluate code security at scale. We tested multiple prompt engineering techniques on GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini. Our results show that for GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini, a security-focused prompt prefix can reduce the occurrence of security vulnerabilities by up to 56%. Additionally, all tested models demonstrated the ability to detect and repair between 41.9% and 68.7% of vulnerabilities in previously generated code when using iterative prompting techniques. Finally, we introduce a "prompt agent" that demonstrates how the most effective techniques can be applied in real-world development workflows.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Benchmarking Prompt Engineering Techniques for Secure Code Generation with GPT Models" explores the effectiveness of prompt engineering in enhancing the security of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors established a benchmark to evaluate various prompt strategies aimed at reducing security vulnerabilities in code. By utilizing established peer-reviewed prompt datasets and static scanning methods, the study assessed the performance of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-4o-mini. Findings indicate that a security-centric prompt prefix can decrease vulnerabilities by up to 56% for the GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini models. Moreover, iterative prompting allowed these models to detect and rectify 41.9% to 68.7% of existing vulnerabilities in previously generated code. The paper culminates with the introduction of a "prompt agent," demonstrating the practical application of these techniques in real-world software development. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates a notable advancement in understanding and enhancing the application of LLMs in secure coding practices, an area increasingly relevant in the context of rising cyber threats. The novel contribution lies in its systematic benchmarking of prompt engineering strategies specifically tailored for code security, a facet that has not been deeply addressed in prior literature. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Benchmarking Approach:** The implementation of a benchmark to quantitatively assess the impact of prompt techniques on code security is a significant contribution to the field of LLMs and secure programming. 2. **Empirical Results:** The quantification of vulnerability reduction and the efficacy of detection techniques provide valuable insights and practical implications for developers relying on LLMs. 3. **Real-world Application:** The introduction of a "prompt agent" bridges the gap between research and practical implementation, which is crucial for adoption in software development environments. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Models:** The study focuses exclusively on specific versions of GPT, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other LLM architectures or future models that may behave differently. 2. **Static Analysis Limitations:** While the use of static scanners can provide insights into security issues, the inherent limitations of static analysis in accurately identifying vulnerabilities should be mindful of, potentially affecting the overall assessment of models. 3. **Contextual Limitations:** The paper does not fully explore how context, complexity, and the nature of tasks may impact the effectiveness of prompt engineering, which could be relevant in understanding broader applications. Overall, the paper fills a critical gap in the intersection of machine learning and software security. By providing benchmarks and empirical evidence of how prompt engineering can directly influence code security, it sets a foundation for future research and practical applications.

- **Abstract**: This paper introduces the Large Memory Model (LM2), a decoder-only Transformer architecture enhanced with an auxiliary memory module that aims to address the limitations of standard Transformers in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and synthesizing information distributed over long contexts. The proposed LM2 incorporates a memory module that acts as a contextual representation repository, interacting with input tokens via cross attention and updating through gating mechanisms. To preserve the Transformers general-purpose capabilities, LM2 maintains the original information flow while integrating a complementary memory pathway. Experimental results on the BABILong benchmark demonstrate that the LM2model outperforms both the memory-augmented RMT model by 37.1% and the baseline Llama-3.2 model by 86.3% on average across tasks. LM2 exhibits exceptional capabilities in multi-hop inference, numerical reasoning, and large-context question-answering. On the MMLU dataset, it achieves a 5.0% improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model, demonstrating that its memory module does not degrade performance on general tasks. Further, in our analysis, we explore the memory interpretability, effectiveness of memory modules, and test-time behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of explicit memory in enhancing Transformer architectures.

This memory module is designed to improve the model's performance in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and managing long-context information, which are recognized limitations of standard Transformers. LM2 integrates a memory pathway that interacts with input tokens using cross attention and is updated via gating mechanisms, allowing it to retain the original architecture’s general-purpose functionality. Results from experimentation on the BABILong benchmark indicate that LM2 significantly outperforms previous models, such as the RMT model and baseline Llama-3.2 model, in various tasks, including multi-hop inference and numerical reasoning. Further, it shows an improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model on the MMLU dataset without degrading general task performance. The paper also analyzes the interpretability and efficacy of the memory module, highlighting the role of explicit memory enhancement in Transformer architectures. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the LM2 architecture lies in its incorporation of an auxiliary memory module, a concept that has seen exploration in various forms in the field of machine learning. However, LM2 distinguishes itself by effectively maintaining the Transformer’s foundational strengths while addressing long-range dependencies and multi-step reasoning challenges. The empirical results reported in the paper demonstrate substantial improvements, which indicate its potential significance in applications requiring complex reasoning, such as question-answering and inference tasks.  However, there are areas of concern. While the paper showcases impressive performance metrics, the experimental designs and the chosen benchmarks might raise questions regarding the generalizability of these results. Extensive testing against a broader range of tasks could better validate the model’s efficacy. Furthermore, the interpretability and design choices of the memory module warrant deeper investigation, as the added complexity must demonstrate clear benefits over simpler models. In conclusion, the contributions of the LM2 model have the potential to influence future research on memory-augmented architectures, particularly in addressing cognitive tasks that require extensive context and reasoning. Nonetheless, concerns around benchmarking rigor and generalizability slightly temper the overall impact. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Jiajun Fan, Shuaike Shen, Chaoran Cheng, Yuxin Chen, Chumeng Liang, Ge Liu
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved great success in fine-tuning diffusion-based generative models. However, fine-tuning continuous flow-based generative models to align with arbitrary user-defined reward functions remains challenging, particularly due to issues such as policy collapse from overoptimization and the prohibitively high computational cost of likelihoods in continuous-time flows. In this paper, we propose an easy-to-use and theoretically sound RL fine-tuning method, which we term Online Reward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization (ORW-CFM-W2). Our method integrates RL into the flow matching framework to fine-tune generative models with arbitrary reward functions, without relying on gradients of rewards or filtered datasets. By introducing an online reward-weighting mechanism, our approach guides the model to prioritize high-reward regions in the data manifold. To prevent policy collapse and maintain diversity, we incorporate Wasserstein-2 (W2) distance regularization into our method and derive a tractable upper bound for it in flow matching, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation of policy optimization. We provide theoretical analyses to demonstrate the convergence properties and induced data distributions of our method, establishing connections with traditional RL algorithms featuring Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and learning behavior of our approach. Extensive experiments on tasks including target image generation, image compression, and text-image alignment demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where our method achieves optimal policy convergence while allowing controllable trade-offs between reward maximization and diversity preservation.

The authors propose a new RL method named Online Reward-Weighted Conditional Flow Matching with Wasserstein-2 Regularization (ORW-CFM-W2) that addresses common challenges such as policy collapse and the high computational demands of likelihood calculations in continuous-time flows. The proposed method introduces an online reward-weighting mechanism to prioritize high-reward areas in the data distribution, while Wasserstein-2 distance regularization is used to maintain diversity and prevent policy collapse. The paper provides theoretical analyses demonstrating the convergence properties and behavior of the method in relation to traditional RL concepts. Experimental results on various tasks exhibit the effectiveness of ORW-CFM-W2 in achieving optimal policy convergence and balancing reward maximization with diversity preservation. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper contributes a novel approach to fine-tuning flow-based generative models using RL methods combined with Wasserstein distance regularization. The integration of an online reward-weighting mechanism and a tractable upper bound for Wasserstein-2 regularization in a flow matching context is innovative, addressing significant shortcomings in past approaches related to policy collapse and computational efficiency. The theoretical grounding and connection to traditional RL frameworks is a valuable aspect that adds depth to the research. **Significance:** This work is significant because it provides a theoretically sound and practically applicable method that can be adopted in generative modeling scenarios where aligning models with complex reward structures can lead to improved performance. By overcoming major barriers in the field, the proposed method has the potential to influence both academic research and practical applications in generative models. **Strengths:** 1.

Potential computational cost considerations in real-world scenarios where model complexity is high are not thoroughly addressed, which could limit practical implementation. 3. The paper could provide more comparative insights against state-of-the-art methods to highlight where its contributions stand relative to other approaches. Overall, while the paper presents noteworthy advancements, certain limitations regarding empirical validation and comparative impact could be addressed in future work.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution with significant innovations and theoretical backing while acknowledging some areas for further exploration and validation to fortify its standing within the field.

### Deconstructing Depression Stigma: Integrating AI-driven Data Collection and Analysis with Causal Knowledge Graphs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06075v1)
- **Authors**: Han Meng, Renwen Zhang, Ganyi Wang, Yitian Yang, Peinuan Qin, Jungup Lee, Yi-Chieh Lee
- **Abstract**: Mental-illness stigma is a persistent social problem, hampering both treatment-seeking and recovery. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to understand it more clearly, but analyzing the relevant data is highly labor-intensive. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to engage participants in conversations; coded those conversations qualitatively with AI assistance; and, based on those coding results, built causal knowledge graphs to decode stigma. The results we obtained from 1,002 participants demonstrate that conversation with our chatbot can elicit rich information about people's attitudes toward depression, while our AI-assisted coding was strongly consistent with human-expert coding. Our novel approach combining large language models (LLMs) and causal knowledge graphs uncovered patterns in individual responses and illustrated the interrelationships of psychological constructs in the dataset as a whole. The paper also discusses these findings' implications for HCI researchers in developing digital interventions, decomposing human psychological constructs, and fostering inclusive attitudes.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Deconstructing Depression Stigma: Integrating AI-driven Data Collection and Analysis with Causal Knowledge Graphs" addresses the significant social issue of mental illness stigma, particularly regarding depression. The authors developed a chatbot to facilitate data collection through conversational engagement with 1,002 participants. The conversations were qualitatively coded with AI support, and these codes were used to construct causal knowledge graphs. The findings indicated that the chatbot effectively gathered in-depth information about attitudes toward depression, and the AI coding method aligned closely with human expert assessments. Moreover, the integration of large language models (LLMs) and causal knowledge graphs revealed patterns in individual responses and their relationships to broader psychological constructs. The implications of this research extend to human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers for crafting digital interventions and acknowledging psychological complexities, ultimately aiming to promote inclusive attitudes. **Evaluation:** This paper represents a notable advancement in the study of stigma surrounding mental illness, particularly through the innovative combination of AI-driven tools and causal knowledge analysis. One of its strengths lies in its methodological approach: using a chatbot for data collection allows for a more naturalistic and potentially less biased engagement compared to traditional survey methods. The validation of AI-assisted coding with human expert coding adds credibility to the findings and highlights the potential for AI in social research. Furthermore, the use of causal knowledge graphs to analyze stigma-related constructs provides significant insights into the interconnectedness of psychological factors, which is often overlooked in traditional analyses. However, some limitations must be acknowledged. The reliance on chatbot-based interactions may not fully capture the breadth of stigma experiences across diverse populations, as participants might be more candid in face-to-face settings or influenced by the anonymity of text conversations. Additionally, while the alignment of AI coding with human coders is reassuring, the paper lacks a detailed consideration of the limitations and potential biases of the AI system employed. The generalizability of findings across different cultural contexts may also be questioned, as cultural perceptions of stigma can vary widely. Overall, the paper offers a fresh perspective on a critical social issue by leveraging advanced technologies, making it a substantial contribution to both mental health research and the field of HCI. The integration of methods and the scope of analysis hold promise for future research and practical applications. **Score: 8**  Justification: The score reflects the paper's strong methodological innovation and importance in the mental health discourse. While it presents compelling insights and applications, it falls short of a perfect score due to concerns about the chatbot's limitations and the need for broader cultural applicability, which could further enhance its significance and impact on the field.

### Debiasing Guidance for Discrete Diffusion with Sequential Monte Carlo
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06079v1)
- **Authors**: Cheuk Kit Lee, Paul Jeha, Jes Frellsen, Pietro Lio, Michael Samuel Albergo, Francisco Vargas
- **Abstract**: Discrete diffusion models are a class of generative models that produce samples from an approximated data distribution within a discrete state space. Often, there is a need to target specific regions of the data distribution. Current guidance methods aim to sample from a distribution with mass proportional to $p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha$ but fail to achieve this in practice. We introduce a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm that generates unbiasedly from this target distribution, utilising the learnt unconditional and guided process. We validate our approach on low-dimensional distributions, controlled images and text generations. For text generation, our method provides strong control while maintaining low perplexity compared to guidance-based approaches.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Debiasing Guidance for Discrete Diffusion with Sequential Monte Carlo" addresses challenges in sampling from discrete diffusion models, particularly in targeting specific regions of data distributions. It critiques existing guidance methods that aim to sample from a distribution proportional to \(p_0(x_0) p(\zeta|x_0)^\alpha\) but highlights their practical inadequacies. To overcome these issues, the authors propose a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm designed to generate unbiased samples from the target distribution. This approach leverages both the unconditional and the guided processes derived from training. The authors then validate their SMC methodology across various domains, including low-dimensional distributions and controlled image and text generation tasks. Notably, in text generation, this method proves effective in achieving strong control while maintaining lower perplexity than existing guidance techniques. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The novelty of this paper lies in its introduction of a new Sequential Monte Carlo framework for discrete diffusion models that addresses the inefficacies of existing guidance techniques. While the concept of using SMC in generative modeling is not entirely new, the application to debias discrete diffusion models distinguishes this work. The authors take a critical approach to existing guidance strategies by quantitatively demonstrating their shortcomings and proposing a real solution. **Significance**:  The significance of this research is multifaceted. First, the development of unbiased sampling methods from specified distributions has broad implications in various fields, such as image synthesis and natural language processing. By providing strong control in text generation while maintaining low perplexity, the proposed method could influence future works on guiding generative models, leading to better quality outputs. The empirical validations across different contexts further bolster the impact of this work. **Strengths**: 1. **Practical Application**: The focus on specific applications (images and text) demonstrates strong real-world relevance. 2. **Comparative Performance**: The paper reports quantitative results showing clear advantages over previous methods, making a persuasive case for its utility. 3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The approach is grounded in a well-established theoretical context, ensuring credibility. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Generalization**: Although the method is validated on low-dimensional distributions and specific tasks, broader generalization to more complex data spaces or distributions may require additional research. 2. **Computational Complexity**: The use of SMC methods can be computationally intensive. The paper could delve deeper into the efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to existing techniques. 3. **Limited Novel Findings in SMC**: While the application to discrete diffusion is novel, the SMC technique itself doesn't introduce entirely new theoretical concepts, which may limit the perceived innovation. ### Conclusion In summary, the paper offers a valuable contribution to the field of generative models by presenting a novel framework that promises improved sampling outcomes. Its application in critical areas such as text and image generation holds significant promise. The outlined strengths and challenges balance out to suggest that while the work is a solid advancement, its potential impact may still hinge on further validations in diverse contexts. **Score: 8**

### ConMeC: A Dataset for Metonymy Resolution with Common Nouns
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06087v1)
- **Authors**: Saptarshi Ghosh, Tianyu Jiang
- **Abstract**: Metonymy plays an important role in our daily communication. People naturally think about things using their most salient properties or commonly related concepts. For example, by saying "The bus decided to skip our stop today," we actually mean that the bus driver made the decision, not the bus. Prior work on metonymy resolution has mainly focused on named entities. However, metonymy involving common nouns (such as desk, baby, and school) is also a frequent and challenging phenomenon. We argue that NLP systems should be capable of identifying the metonymic use of common nouns in context. We create a new metonymy dataset ConMeC, which consists of 6,000 sentences, where each sentence is paired with a target common noun and annotated by humans to indicate whether that common noun is used metonymically or not in that context. We also introduce a chain-of-thought based prompting method for detecting metonymy using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate our LLM-based pipeline, as well as a supervised BERT model on our dataset and three other metonymy datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs could achieve performance comparable to the supervised BERT model on well-defined metonymy categories, while still struggling with instances requiring nuanced semantic understanding. Our dataset is publicly available at: https://github.com/SaptGhosh/ConMeC.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents ConMeC, a new dataset aimed at tackling the challenge of metonymy resolution specifically involving common nouns, an area that has been understudied compared to named entities. Metonymy, as defined, involves the use of a word to refer to something closely related (e.g., "the bus" to mean the bus driver). The dataset consists of 6,000 annotated sentences where common nouns are identified as either metonymic or not. Additionally, the authors propose a chain-of-thought prompting method to enhance large language models' (LLMs) ability to recognize metonymic usage. Experimental results show that LLMs can achieve performance similar to that of a supervised BERT model on defined categories of metonymy, although they struggle with more nuanced cases. The dataset is made publicly available for further research. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its focus on metonymy involving common nouns, an area that has received comparatively little attention. While named entity metonymy has been extensively researched, addressing common nouns opens new avenues for understanding language nuances, which are crucial for natural language processing (NLP) applications. The creation of a substantial dataset (6,000 sentences) specifically targeting this linguistic feature is commendably ambitious and fills a significant gap in the available resources for researchers. One of the strengths of the paper is its practical contributions, as it not only provides data but also proposes a methodology that combines LLMs with innovative prompting techniques. The results demonstrate the potential of these models, indicating they're approaching the performance of established supervised techniques, which is a positive finding for the NLP community. However, there are some weaknesses to address. The paper could have explored the limitations of the LLMs in more detail, particularly in relation to specific cases where performance dips significantly due to the complexity of the metonymic expressions. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the implications of the results for future NLP models and systems would enhance the paper's impact. The public availability of the dataset is a strong point, yet its usability could be further supported by providing guidelines on implementation or examples of its practical applications. In terms of significance, while the contribution is valuable, the overall impact may be somewhat limited by the specificity of the dataset and its applications. The challenge of nuanced semantic understanding suggests that there remains considerable work to bridge the gap between current model performance and human-level understanding of metonymy. **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution with clear novelty and practical application but suggests room for further exploration and depth in discussing the implications and limitations of the findings. The paper serves as a meaningful advancement in metonymy research but does not quite reach the level of transformative impact that a higher score would indicate.

### RALLRec: Improving Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model Recommendation with Representation Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06101v1)
- **Authors**: Jian Xu, Sichun Luo, Xiangyu Chen, Haoming Huang, Hanxu Hou, Linqi Song
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommendation systems to enhance user behavior comprehension. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance. However, existing RAG methods rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, limiting the effectiveness of the systems. In this paper, we propose Representation learning for retrieval-Augmented Large Language model Recommendation (RALLRec). Specifically, we enhance textual semantics by prompting LLMs to generate more detailed item descriptions, followed by joint representation learning of textual and collaborative semantics, which are extracted by the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. Considering the potential time-varying characteristics of user interest, a simple yet effective reranking method is further introduced to capture the dynamics of user preference. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the evaluation results validated the effectiveness of our method. Code is made public at https://github.com/JianXu95/RALLRec.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper "RALLRec: Improving Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model Recommendation with Representation Learning" addresses limitations in existing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods within recommendation systems that predominantly use textual semantics. The authors propose a novel approach called RALLRec, which enhances item retrieval by generating detailed item descriptions through Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrating a joint representation learning framework that combines textual and collaborative semantics. Furthermore, the method includes a reranking component to account for time-varying user preferences. Experimental results across three real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, and the authors have made their code publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** RALLRec's integration of detailed item descriptions generated by LLMs to enhance retrieval mechanisms is a noteworthy innovation. The combination of textual and collaborative learning represents a fresh approach to improving personalization in recommendations, which has been a growing concern in the field. Additionally, the incorporation of user interest dynamics via a reranking method is another strong point, showing that the authors are cognizant of the evolving nature of user preferences. **Significance:** The significance of this paper lies in its potential to enhance the practical performance of recommendation systems. By addressing the limitations of prior RAG methods in real applications, RALLRec could lead to more accurate and relevant recommendations for users, making it a valuable contribution to both academia and industry. **Strengths:** - **Innovative Concept**: The dual focus on textual and collaborative semantics is quite innovative and could inspire future research in multimodal learning contexts. - **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimentation on real-world datasets strengthens the claims made and showcases the practical efficacy of the proposed method. - **Open Source**: Providing the code enhances replicability and allows other researchers to build on the authors' work. **Weaknesses:** - **Limited Scope of Datasets**: While the paper evaluates its method on three datasets, it doesn’t discuss the diversity of these datasets and whether the results could be generalized to other domains or types of data. - **Complexity**: The proposed method might increase the overall complexity of the recommendation system, which could affect processing time or the feasibility of integration into existing systems. While RALLRec presents a substantial advancement in the area of LLMs within recommendation systems, the potential limitations related to dataset diversity and complexity warrant a slightly cautious approach. Overall, the contribution is significant but still requires further exploration in varied contexts. **Score: 8**

### CDM: Contact Diffusion Model for Multi-Contact Point Localization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06109v1)
- **Authors**: Seo Wook Han, Min Jun Kim
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a Contact Diffusion Model (CDM), a novel learning-based approach for multi-contact point localization. We consider a robot equipped with joint torque sensors and a force/torque sensor at the base. By leveraging a diffusion model, CDM addresses the singularity where multiple pairs of contact points and forces produce identical sensor measurements. We formulate CDM to be conditioned on past model outputs to account for the time-dependent characteristics of the multi-contact scenarios. Moreover, to effectively address the complex shape of the robot surfaces, we incorporate the signed distance field in the denoising process. Consequently, CDM can localize contacts at arbitrary locations with high accuracy. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, CDM operates at 15.97ms and, in the real world, achieves an error of 0.44cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24cm in dual-contact scenarios.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces the Contact Diffusion Model (CDM), a novel approach for localizing multiple contact points on a robot using joint torque and force/torque sensors. CDM effectively addresses the challenge of multiple contact points producing identical sensor data, a situation known as singularity, by employing a diffusion model conditioned on prior model outputs to consider temporal dynamics. A signed distance field is utilized in the denoising process to handle the complex geometries of robot surfaces, resulting in high localization accuracy for contact points. The model demonstrates a rapid operational speed of 15.97 ms and achieves localization errors of 0.44 cm in single-contact scenarios and 1.24 cm in dual-contact scenarios, supported by robust simulation and empirical data. ### Evaluation: The novelty of the paper lies in its unique combination of a diffusion model and the incorporation of a signed distance field for handling the complexities of multi-contact localization. This addresses a recognized issue in robotic sensing—singularity in sensor measurements—by introducing a method that is time-aware and capable of dealing with diverse contact points on the robot's surface. The performance metrics highlighted (15.97 ms operational time and low localization errors) suggest it is a practical solution for real-time applications in robotics. However, there are certain areas of weakness. The authors could have provided a more thorough comparison with existing approaches to contextualize the advantages of CDM better. Additionally, while simulations are useful, real-world validations should encompass a broader range of scenarios, particularly in varied environments, to ensure robustness. Furthermore, the implications of potential sensor noise and environmental factors on the model's performance should have been discussed in greater depth. In terms of significance, CDM could have a substantial impact on fields that require precise localization—such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. The ability to accurately localize multiple contact points enhances a robot's interaction capability with its environment, which is critical for tasks requiring dexterity and precision. Based on the aforementioned strengths—novelty in methodology, significant accuracy, and potential applicability in real-world scenarios, combined with the weaknesses regarding comparative context and validation breadth—I would assign this paper a score of **Score: 7**. This score reflects a solid contribution to the field while acknowledging the areas that could enhance its impact further.

- **Authors**: Ce Zhang, Zifu Wan, Zhehan Kan, Martin Q. Ma, Simon Stepputtis, Deva Ramanan, Russ Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency, Katia Sycara, Yaqi Xie
- **Abstract**: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in multi-modal tasks, they are prone to generating hallucinatory text responses that do not align with the given visual input, which restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper addresses the challenge of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where the generated text can be incorrect or misaligned with the visual input. The authors propose a novel method termed "Decoding with Generative Feedback" (DeGF), which utilizes text-to-image generative models to provide self-correction mechanisms for the output of LVLMs. By generating an image from the initial text response, DeGF creates an auxiliary visual reference that assists in verifying and correcting the initial text through a process of complementary or contrastive decoding. The authors present experimental evidence demonstrating that DeGF effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques across six benchmarks. They also provide a public code repository for reproducibility. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**: The approach of leveraging text-to-image generation to provide self-feedback in LVLMs is somewhat novel. While the concept of using generative models to enhance the reliability of language responses is not entirely new, the specific framework of incorporating generative feedback directly into the decoding process represents an innovative fusion. However, the field is already aware of generative processes and feedback mechanisms, which may dilute the perceived novelty. **Significance**: Hallucinations in LVLMs pose significant constraints in real-world applications, making the quest for effective solutions highly relevant. The introduction of DeGF could potentially influence the design of future LVLMs by integrating cross-modal generative feedback. Nevertheless, the practicality and scalability of the proposed method in diverse applications might require further investigation. **Strengths**:  - Comprehensive experimental validation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates the method's effectiveness. - Introducing a training-free algorithm reduces the barriers for implementation and may encourage broader adoption in the community. - Providing access to code enhances reproducibility, which is critical in research. **Weaknesses**:  - The paper may lack a thorough comparison with a broader range of existing methods beyond state-of-the-art adjustments, limiting the context for assessing effectiveness. - Discussion around the limitations, edge cases, and potential drawbacks of GenFG is minimal, leaving questions on its robustness when faced with more complex stimuli. - The focus appears heavily driven by quantitative metrics, with limited qualitative assessments of the generated outputs in practical scenarios. **Conclusion**: Overall, while the paper makes a novel contribution and addresses an important problem in the field of vision-language models, it also has areas of improvement in depth of analysis and broader performance context. Thus, the paper is a valuable addition, but its impact may ultimately depend on further developments and comparisons in future studies. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06139v1)
- **Authors**: Sumin An, Junyoung Sung, Wonpyo Park, Chanjun Park, Paul Hongsuck Seo
- **Abstract**: While large language models (LLMs) excel in generating coherent and contextually rich outputs, their capacity to efficiently handle long-form contexts is limited by fixed-length position embeddings. Additionally, the computational cost of processing long sequences increases quadratically, making it challenging to extend context length. To address these challenges, we propose Long-form Context Injection with Recurrent Compression (LCIRC), a method that enables the efficient processing long-form sequences beyond the model's length limit through recurrent compression without retraining the entire model. We further introduce query dependent context modeling, which selectively compresses query-relevant information, ensuring that the model retains the most pertinent content. Our empirical results demonstrate that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly improves LLM's ability to manage extended contexts, making it well-suited for tasks that require both comprehensive context understanding and query relevance.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents LCIRC, an innovative method aimed at enhancing the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in managing long-form contexts. The primary challenge addressed is the limitation of fixed-length position embeddings and the quadratic increase in computation costs as sequence length grows. LCIRC utilizes recurrent compression to enable LLMs to process lengthy sequences beyond their usual constraints without requiring a complete model retraining. Furthermore, the authors introduce a query-dependent context modeling approach, which selectively compresses information relevant to specific queries, optimizing the retention of important content. Empirical findings suggest that Query Dependent LCIRC (QD-LCIRC) significantly boosts the models' ability to handle extended contexts effectively, making it particularly useful for applications needing deep comprehension of context juxtaposed with query specificity. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of LCIRC lies in its approach to overcome traditional limitations of LLMs regarding long-form context processing. The combination of recurrent compression and query-dependent information retention is a distinct contribution that could meaningfully address practical issues faced in natural language processing. Moreover, the emphasis on query relevance adds a robust layer to context modeling, which is particularly relevant as systems are increasingly required to parse and generate relevant outputs from vast amounts of data. Strengths of the paper include: - The innovative framework of recurrent compression, which proposes a practical and efficient method of extending LLM capability without the heavy computational costs associated with typical model expansions. - Empirical validation of the method's effectiveness in maintaining context relevance, which is critical for applications like conversational agents, text summarization, and retrieval-augmented generation tasks. - Clear articulation of challenges in existing models, setting a solid foundation for the proposed solution. However, there are also notable weaknesses: - The paper lacks an extensive comparison with other existing techniques that also aim to improve long-context handling or relate to compression methods, which could further strengthen its claims. - While empirical results show improvements, the paper would benefit from elaborating on the scalability of LCIRC and QD-LCIRC across various model architectures and tasks. - The study doesn’t provide a deep theoretical underpinning of why recurrent compression is particularly advantageous over other potential methodologies. In conclusion, LCIRC represents a significant step in optimizing LLMs for long-form contexts and query relevance. Yet, more comparative analysis and theoretical grounding would bolster its contributions. Given its original approach and potential impact, I assign a score of **Score: 8**.

- **Authors**: Li Hu, Guangyuan Wang, Zhen Shen, Xin Gao, Dechao Meng, Lian Zhuo, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang, Liefeng Bo
- **Abstract**: Recent character image animation methods based on diffusion models, such as Animate Anyone, have made significant progress in generating consistent and generalizable character animations. However, these approaches fail to produce reasonable associations between characters and their environments. To address this limitation, we introduce Animate Anyone 2, aiming to animate characters with environment affordance. Beyond extracting motion signals from source video, we additionally capture environmental representations as conditional inputs. The environment is formulated as the region with the exclusion of characters and our model generates characters to populate these regions while maintaining coherence with the environmental context. We propose a shape-agnostic mask strategy that more effectively characterizes the relationship between character and environment. Furthermore, to enhance the fidelity of object interactions, we leverage an object guider to extract features of interacting objects and employ spatial blending for feature injection. We also introduce a pose modulation strategy that enables the model to handle more diverse motion patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Animate Anyone 2, an advancement over previous methods in character image animation that address the shortcomings of associating animated characters with their environments. While prior techniques using diffusion models succeeded in producing consistent animations, they lacked meaningful environmental context. Animate Anyone 2 improves upon this by introducing environmental representations as conditional inputs, formulating environments as areas devoid of characters, thereby allowing for character placement that aligns with environmental cues. The authors employ a shape-agnostic mask strategy to better illustrate character-environment relationships, use an object guider for enhanced interaction fidelity, and adopt spatial blending for feature integration. Additionally, a pose modulation strategy is introduced to accommodate varied motion patterns. The experimental results claim a significant enhancement in animation performance using their proposed methodologies. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The contribution of Animate Anyone 2 lies in its focus on integrating character animations with environmental contexts, which previous models largely overlooked. By emphasizing the relationship between characters and their surroundings, the paper addresses a critical gap in the current state of animated methods. The introduction of environmental representations and object interaction features indicates a novel approach in animation practices, pushing forward the boundaries of what can be achieved through automated animation generation. **Significance:** The significance of this work is substantial within the field of character animation, particularly in applications where interaction with environments is crucial, such as in gaming, virtual reality, and film. By improving the coherence and fidelity of character-environment interactions, the research could lead to more immersive experiences, which is a key area of interest in animation and computer graphics. **Strengths:**  1. **Innovative Approach:** An effective strategy for integrating environmental cues improves the realism of the animations. 2. **Technical Depth:** The methods discussed, particularly the object guider and pose modulation strategy, showcase robust technical innovations. 3. **Comprehensive Testing:** The experimental results suggest an improvement over previous models, providing evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed methods. **Weaknesses:**  1. **Limited Scope of Application:** While the integration of environmental affordances is significant, the study does not explore the applicability of this method across varied environments or the challenges posed by highly dynamic scenes. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The advanced techniques may complicate implementation in real-time scenarios, potentially limiting their practical usability. 3. **Lack of Comparison with Diverse Techniques:** While comparisons are made with earlier models, a broader analysis against a variety of character animation methodologies might offer deeper insights into the performance and utility of Animate Anyone 2. **Overall Assessment:** The paper represents a noteworthy advancement in the realm of character animation by thoughtfully addressing the integration of environmental factors, thus enhancing the generation of more coherent and context-aware animations. The innovative strategies proposed not only tackle existing gaps but also open avenues for further research and application. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Eri Onami, Taiki Miyanishi, Koki Maeda, Shuhei Kurita
- **Abstract**: Legal documents including judgments and court orders require highly sophisticated legal knowledge for understanding. To disclose expert knowledge for non-experts, we explore the problem of visualizing legal texts with easy-to-understand diagrams and propose a novel dataset of LegalViz with 23 languages and 7,010 cases of legal document and visualization pairs, using the DOT graph description language of Graphviz. LegalViz provides a simple diagram from a complicated legal corpus identifying legal entities, transactions, legal sources, and statements at a glance, that are essential in each judgment. In addition, we provide new evaluation metrics for the legal diagram visualization by considering graph structures, textual similarities, and legal contents. We conducted empirical studies on few-shot and finetuning large language models for generating legal diagrams and evaluated them with these metrics, including legal content-based evaluation within 23 languages. Models trained with LegalViz outperform existing models including GPTs, confirming the effectiveness of our dataset.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "LegalViz: Legal Text Visualization by Text To Diagram Generation" addresses the challenge of making complex legal documents accessible to non-experts through visualization. The authors introduce LegalViz, a new dataset comprising 7,010 pairs of legal texts and their corresponding visualizations across 23 languages. Utilizing the DOT graph description language from Graphviz, the proposed visualizations simplify legal entities, transactions, sources, and statements contained in legal judgments. The authors also present new evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of legal diagram visualizations, taking into account graph structure, textual similarity, and relevance to legal content. Empirical studies demonstrate that models trained on the LegalViz dataset outperform existing models, including GPTs, indicating the dataset's effectiveness for generating legal diagrams in a multilingual context. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of the Dataset:** The introduction of the LegalViz dataset, particularly with its multilingual aspect, fills a significant gap in legal text visualization research. Prior work has often been limited by language and scope, making this contribution particularly relevant. 2. **Methodology:** The use of new evaluation metrics provides a more comprehensive analysis of legal diagram visualizations compared to previous studies. This approach emphasizes the importance of both structural and contextual evaluation in legal visuals. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors conducted thorough empirical studies comparing their model's performance against existing models. The positive results lend credibility to the proposed methodology and highlight the potential of using large language models for this task. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Application:** While the dataset is extensive, the focus on legal documents may limit its applicability within broader areas of text visualization. As legal jargon can be highly specialized, it may not fully generalize to other text genres. 2. **Dependency on Quality of Input Texts:** The effectiveness of the visualizations heavily depends on the clarity and quality of the legal texts. Poorly written or ambiguous legal documents may still pose challenges, potentially undermining the utility of the visualizations. 3. **Evaluation Rigidity:** While the new metrics are an improvement, they remain relatively traditional and may benefit from incorporating user-centered evaluations, such as usability studies to understand how actual users (non-experts) interact with the visualizations. **Overall Significance:** The paper contributes to a growing field aimed at demystifying legal language through visualization. Given the increasing complexity of legal texts and the need for transparency, the innovations presented have the potential to impact legal education and public understanding significantly. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's robust contribution to legal text visualization through a novel dataset and evaluation metrics, alongside a sound empirical foundation. However, the limitations regarding the generalizability and the user-focused evaluations need addressing to enhance its impact further.

- **Authors**: Yan Weng, Fengbin Zhu, Tong Ye, Haoyan Liu, Fuli Feng, Tat-Seng Chua
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which integrates external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), has proven effective in enabling LLMs to produce more accurate and reliable responses. However, it remains a significant challenge how to effectively integrate external retrieved knowledge with internal parametric knowledge in LLMs. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Selection RAG framework, where the LLM is made to select from pairwise responses generated with internal parametric knowledge solely and with external retrieved knowledge together to achieve enhanced accuracy. To this end, we devise a Self-Selection-RGP method to enhance the capabilities of the LLM in both generating and selecting the correct answer, by training the LLM with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) over a curated Retrieval Generation Preference (RGP) dataset. Experimental results with two open-source LLMs (i.e., Llama2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B) well demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other baseline methods on Natural Questions (NQ) and TrivialQA datasets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Optimizing Knowledge Integration in Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Self-Selection" introduces a new framework called Self-Selection RAG to address the challenges of integrating external retrieved knowledge with the internal knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively. The authors propose a method where the model selects the most accurate response from two sets: one generated solely from internal knowledge and another combining internal and external knowledge. The Self-Selection-RGP method leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) trained on a specially curated dataset to improve the model's performance in both generation and selection tasks. Experimental results show that this approach enhances accuracy in the contexts of Natural Questions and TrivialQA datasets when evaluated with open-source LLMs like Llama2-13B-Chat and Mistral-7B, outperforming existing baseline methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper primarily lies in its Self-Selection RAG framework, which focuses on the selection aspect of the response generation process in RAG systems. This aspect is critical, as accurately determining which piece of knowledge (from internal or external sources) to utilize is a significant hurdle in retrieval-augmented generation systems. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The self-selection mechanism introduces a new paradigm in RAG systems by allowing the model to make informed decisions between competing responses, which can effectively improve accuracy. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments with two different LLMs on well-known datasets lend credibility to the findings and suggest practical applicability. Demonstrating superiority over baseline methods indicates thoroughness in evaluation. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity in Implementation**: While the framework is theoretically sound, the practical implementation and computational cost of the pairwise response generation and selection process may limit its usability for real-time applications. 2. **Concerns Over Generalization**: The experimental focus on only two datasets could raise questions about the model’s generalization capabilities. Further verification across diverse datasets would strengthen its claims. **Potential Influence:** This work could significantly impact the development of more effective retrieval-augmented systems in NLP. By introducing a method that focuses on accuracy through response selection, the framework could lead to improved applications in information retrieval and conversational agents. **Score: 8**   The score reflects the paper's substantial theoretical contribution and empirical validation but also acknowledges some limitations concerning practical implementation and generalizability. The introduced framework represents an important step forward in knowledge integration in LLMs, but further exploration and validation on a broader range of datasets would be beneficial.

### Scaling Public Health Text Annotation: Zero-Shot Learning vs. Crowdsourcing for Improved Efficiency and Labeling Accuracy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06150v1)
- **Authors**: Kamyar Kazari, Yong Chen, Zahra Shakeri
- **Abstract**: Public health researchers are increasingly interested in using social media data to study health-related behaviors, but manually labeling this data can be labor-intensive and costly. This study explores whether zero-shot labeling using large language models (LLMs) can match or surpass conventional crowd-sourced annotation for Twitter posts related to sleep disorders, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Multiple annotation pipelines were designed to compare labels produced by domain experts, crowd workers, and LLM-driven approaches under varied prompt-engineering strategies. Our findings indicate that LLMs can rival human performance in straightforward classification tasks and significantly reduce labeling time, yet their accuracy diminishes for tasks requiring more nuanced domain knowledge. These results clarify the trade-offs between automated scalability and human expertise, demonstrating conditions under which LLM-based labeling can be efficiently integrated into public health research without undermining label quality.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper investigates the efficiency and accuracy of zero-shot learning with large language models (LLMs) compared to traditional crowdsourcing techniques for annotating social media data related to public health, specifically focusing on Twitter posts about sleep disorders, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. The authors developed different annotation pipelines that assessed labeling produced by domain experts, crowd workers, and LLMs through various prompt-engineering strategies. Results indicate that while LLMs can compete with human annotators on straightforward classification tasks and significantly reduce labeling time, their performance declines on tasks needing deeper domain knowledge. The study delineates the trade-offs between the scalability of automated methods and the expertise of human annotation, suggesting scenarios where LLMs can be effectively employed in public health research without compromising labeling quality. **Critical Evaluation:**   This paper presents a relevant and timely topic given the increasing reliance on social media data in public health research and the need for efficient data annotation. Its exploration of LLMs as an alternative to traditional crowdsourcing for annotation tasks is both novel and impactful, especially in the context of under-resourced research scenarios where labor-intensive manual labeling is impractical. **Strengths:**   1. **Timeliness and Relevance:** The application of LLMs to public health research underscores an exciting intersection of technology and health. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** The systematic comparison among experts, crowdsourcing, and LLMs provides comprehensive insights into different labeling strategies, crucial for future research. 3. **Scalability Focus:** The paper successfully addresses a significant barrier in public health research—scalability—by presenting an innovative solution with LLMs. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Nuanced Task Limitations:** The study reveals that LLMs struggle with tasks requiring nuanced understanding, which is a critical aspect of health data classification that could limit their application in more complex scenarios. 2. **Generalizability:** The findings may be context-specific, primarily focused on Twitter posts concerning certain health topics, which could restrict the paper’s broader applicability in diverse health domains. 3. **Methodological Transparency:** While multiple pipelines are discussed, a detailed methodology and statistical analysis are necessary to substantiate claims about labeling accuracy improvements. Based on these observations, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by providing insights into optimizing public health data annotation. However, its limitations, particularly regarding nuanced task performance and generalizability, prevent it from being classified as groundbreaking. Therefore, the score reflects a decent, yet cautious endorsement of its contributions. **Score: 7**

### Powerformer: A Transformer with Weighted Causal Attention for Time-series Forecasting
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06151v1)
- **Authors**: Kareem Hegazy, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson
- **Abstract**: Transformers have recently shown strong performance in time-series forecasting, but their all-to-all attention mechanism overlooks the (temporal) causal and often (temporally) local nature of data. We introduce Powerformer, a novel Transformer variant that replaces noncausal attention weights with causal weights that are reweighted according to a smooth heavy-tailed decay. This simple yet effective modification endows the model with an inductive bias favoring temporally local dependencies, while still allowing sufficient flexibility to learn the unique correlation structure of each dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate that Powerformer not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public time-series benchmarks, but also that it offers improved interpretability of attention patterns. Our analyses show that the model's locality bias is amplified during training, demonstrating an interplay between time-series data and power-law-based attention. These findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modifications to the Transformer architecture for time-series forecasting, and they establish Powerformer as a strong, efficient, and principled baseline for future research and real-world applications.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Powerformer: A Transformer with Weighted Causal Attention for Time-series Forecasting" addresses the limitations of traditional Transformer architectures in time-series forecasting due to their all-to-all attention mechanism, which fails to reflect the causal and local nature of temporal data. The authors propose a novel variant called Powerformer, which replaces conventional noncausal attention weights with causal weights adjusted using a smooth heavy-tailed decay function. This design adjustment enhances the model's ability to capture temporary local dependencies while also maintaining flexibility to adapt to various datasets. Empirical results indicate that Powerformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on public time-series forecasting benchmarks and provides improved interpretability of attention patterns. The analysis highlights the model's locality bias, which intensifies during training, suggesting a beneficial interaction between time-series characteristics and power-law-based attention mechanisms. The paper argues for the necessity of tailored Transformer modifications in the context of time-series data analysis. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The innovation presented in Powerformer lies primarily in its modification of the attention mechanism to enhance performance in a domain where causality and locality are paramount. While the Transformer architecture has gained traction in numerous applications, its use in time-series forecasting has been relatively underexplored. By foregrounding causal attention with a heavy-tailed decay mechanism, the authors offer a significant shift in how Transformer models can be tailored to meet the unique demands of time-series data. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Contribution**: Powerformer introduces a targeted adjustment to the Transformer architecture that specifically addresses the shortcomings in causal attention for time-series forecasting, clearly defining its novelty. 2. **State-of-the-art Performance**: The empirical results demonstrating higher accuracy compared to existing competitive models bolster the claim of significance and effectiveness. 3. **Interpretability**: Improved interpretability of attention patterns is a relevant addition, enhancing the usability of the model in practical scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Generalizability**: The study primarily focuses on public benchmarks, raising questions about generalizability across diverse real-world datasets outside the benchmarks used. 2. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: While it claims improved performance, a deeper comparative analysis with more rigorous baseline Transformers would strengthen the arguments. 3. **Theoretical Backing**: The paper could benefit from a more robust theoretical underpinning explaining why heavy-tailed decay is particularly suited for time-series forecasting. **Conclusion and Score:** Overall, Powerformer presents a meaningful modification to existing Transformer architecture with a practical application in time-series forecasting, demonstrating both theoretical novelty and empirical effectiveness. However, the limited scope of datasets tested and the necessity for a deeper comparative analysis and theoretical justification moderate its impact. Thus, a score of **8** reflects a robust contribution while acknowledging areas for further exploration. **Score: 8**

### Efficient-vDiT: Efficient Video Diffusion Transformers With Attention Tile
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06155v1)
- **Authors**: Hangliang Ding, Dacheng Li, Runlong Su, Peiyuan Zhang, Zhijie Deng, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang
- **Abstract**: Despite the promise of synthesizing high-fidelity videos, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) with 3D full attention suffer from expensive inference due to the complexity of attention computation and numerous sampling steps. For example, the popular Open-Sora-Plan model consumes more than 9 minutes for generating a single video of 29 frames. This paper addresses the inefficiency issue from two aspects: 1) Prune the 3D full attention based on the redundancy within video data; We identify a prevalent tile-style repetitive pattern in the 3D attention maps for video data, and advocate a new family of sparse 3D attention that holds a linear complexity w.r.t. the number of video frames. 2) Shorten the sampling process by adopting existing multi-step consistency distillation; We split the entire sampling trajectory into several segments and perform consistency distillation within each one to activate few-step generation capacities. We further devise a three-stage training pipeline to conjoin the low-complexity attention and few-step generation capacities. Notably, with 0.1% pretraining data, we turn the Open-Sora-Plan-1.2 model into an efficient one that is 7.4x -7.8x faster for 29 and 93 frames 720p video generation with a marginal performance trade-off in VBench. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is amenable to distributed inference, achieving an additional 3.91x speedup when running on 4 GPUs with sequence parallelism.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces **Efficient-vDiT**, a novel framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). The authors target two key inefficiencies: the heavy computational load and prolonged sampling times associated with traditional 3D full attention mechanisms. They propose a sparse 3D attention model that reduces attention complexity to linear with respect to video frames by exploiting repetitive patterns in the 3D attention maps. Additionally, they employ consistency distillation to shorten the sampling process, segmenting the sampling trajectory into manageable segments for quicker generation. The proposed three-stage training pipeline strategically combines these reduced-complexity attention methods and fewer sampling steps. The results demonstrate significant improvements, making the **Open-Sora-Plan-1.2** model 7.4x to 7.8x faster in generating videos with only minor performance trade-offs. The framework also supports distributed inference, yielding an extra 3.91x speed boost on multiple GPUs. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:**  The paper presents a commendable innovation in the realm of video synthesis by addressing the inefficiencies associated with DiTs. The introduction of sparse 3D attention is particularly notable, as it reflects a deep understanding of the structural complexities in video data. The methods proposed for consistency distillation also reveal an inventive way to enhance the efficiency of the sampling process, which is a recognized bottleneck in current frameworks. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to enable faster generation of high-fidelity videos, which is a critical factor in practical applications, including creative industries and real-time video processing. By achieving a notable reduction in generation time and ensuring scalability through distributed inference, the authors address both academic and industrial needs effectively. **Strengths:** - The exploration of low-complexity attention is insightful and well-supported by experiments. - The empirical validation through improvements in the Open-Sora-Plan model provides tangible evidence of the claims made. - The systematic approach taken in developing the three-stage training pipeline enhances the robustness of the method. **Weaknesses:** - While the performance gains presented are impressive, the trade-offs in video quality could be further elucidated. More extensive qualitative evaluations or user studies could enhance the understanding of the practical implications of the marginal performance trade-offs. - The paper could delve deeper into potential limitations of the proposed methods, particularly in diverse video content or longer video sequences. **Overall Impact:** This paper adds a meaningful perspective to the efficient processing of videos using state-of-the-art AI techniques. Its contributions could inspire further research into sparse attention mechanisms and efficiency improvements in generative models, potentially influencing future developments in AI-driven video synthesis. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to addressing critical inefficiencies in video synthesis, balanced by some areas needing further clarification and evaluation. The work has notable implications for both theory and application, warranting a high score while acknowledging room for enhancement.

- **Authors**: Yifang Chen, Xiaoyu Li, Yingyu Liang, Zhenmei Shi, Zhao Song
- **Abstract**: We investigate the fundamental limits of transformer-based foundation models, extending our analysis to include Visual Autoregressive (VAR) transformers. VAR represents a big step toward generating images using a novel, scalable, coarse-to-fine ``next-scale prediction'' framework. These models set a new quality bar, outperforming all previous methods, including Diffusion Transformers, while having state-of-the-art performance for image synthesis tasks. Our primary contributions establish that, for single-head VAR transformers with a single self-attention layer and single interpolation layer, the VAR Transformer is universal. From the statistical perspective, we prove that such simple VAR transformers are universal approximators for any image-to-image Lipschitz functions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that flow-based autoregressive transformers inherit similar approximation capabilities. Our results provide important design principles for effective and computationally efficient VAR Transformer strategies that can be used to extend their utility to more sophisticated VAR models in image generation and other related areas.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the capabilities of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) transformers as a significant advancement in image generation. The authors propose a scalable, coarse-to-fine "next-scale prediction" approach, demonstrating that single-head VAR transformers with minimal architecture (a single self-attention and interpolation layer) can serve as universal approximators for Lipschitz functions, which are crucial for image-to-image transformation tasks. Their results indicate that these models not only set new performance standards compared to previous architectures, such as Diffusion Transformers, but also that flow-based autoregressive transformers share similar capabilities. The findings provide foundational design principles for developing computationally efficient VAR transformers that could enhance their application in image synthesis and beyond. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel approach by extending the concept of universal approximation to the realm of transformers, particularly in the context of image generation through the lens of VAR transformers. This is a meaningful contribution as it sheds light on the capabilities of less complex models while reinforcing their effectiveness in high-dimensional tasks like image synthesis. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contribution:** Establishing that minimal VAR architectures are universal approximators provides a theoretical underpinning that can influence future model designs and not just for image synthesis. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper demonstrates superior performance relative to currently popular models like Diffusion Transformers, indicating that the proposed method is not only theoretically sound but also practically valuable. 3. **Design Principles:** By extracting effective strategies for computational efficiency in VAR transformers, the paper presents actionable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization:** While the findings are promising, the paper does not adequately discuss the implications of its results in more complex or varied contexts beyond the specific settings they tested. 2. **Comparison with Alternatives:** Although they mention improved performance over previous methods, the scope and methodology of comparisons could be expanded to provide deeper insights into where the VAR transformers excel or fall short relative to other state-of-the-art techniques. 3. **Complexity Handling:** The paper primarily focuses on single-head transformers; it would benefit from exploration on how the principles derived can be applied to multi-head configurations, which dominate the field. Overall, the paper makes a commendable contribution to the ongoing discourse around transformers and their efficiency in image-related tasks. However, to solidify its impact and applicability, it should address the points of generalization and handle comparisons more comprehensively. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.

- **Authors**: Yaoxin Yang, Peng Ye, Weihao Lin, Kangcong Li, Yan Wen, Jia Hao, Tao Chen
- **Abstract**: Heterogeneous distillation is an effective way to transfer knowledge from cross-architecture teacher models to student models. However, existing heterogeneous distillation methods do not take full advantage of the dark knowledge hidden in the teacher's output, limiting their performance.To this end, we propose a novel framework named Multi-Level Decoupled Relational Knowledge Distillation (MLDR-KD) to unleash the potential of relational distillation in heterogeneous distillation. Concretely, we first introduce Decoupled Finegrained Relation Alignment (DFRA) in both logit and feature levels to balance the trade-off between distilled dark knowledge and the confidence in the correct category of the heterogeneous teacher model. Then, Multi-Scale Dynamic Fusion (MSDF) module is applied to dynamically fuse the projected logits of multiscale features at different stages in student model, further improving performance of our method in feature level. We verify our method on four architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs and Mambas), two datasets (CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet). Compared with the best available method, our MLDR-KD improves student model performance with gains of up to 4.86% on CIFAR-100 and 2.78% on Tiny-ImageNet datasets respectively, showing robustness and generality in heterogeneous distillation. Code will be released soon.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a new framework called Multi-Level Decoupled Relational Knowledge Distillation (MLDR-KD) aimed at improving heterogeneous knowledge distillation from teacher models across different architectures to student models. The authors highlight the limitations of existing methods in capitalizing on "dark knowledge" in teacher outputs. MLDR-KD employs two main innovations: Decoupled Finegrained Relation Alignment (DFRA) to balance knowledge sharing and classification confidence, and the Multi-Scale Dynamic Fusion (MSDF) module to meaningfully integrate logits from various feature scales within the student model. The authors validate their approach using four types of architectures (CNNs, Transformers, MLPs, and Mambas) and two datasets (CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet), achieving performance improvements of up to 4.86% and 2.78% respectively, compared to existing methods. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a commendable approach to enhancing heterogeneous distillation through innovative techniques (DFRA and MSDF). The novelty lies in the method’s structured integration of relational knowledge and its potential to improve distillation efficacy across diverse model architectures. However, the paper could benefit from deeper theoretical underpinnings for the chosen methods and a more detailed exploration of their limitations in practical scenarios. Strengths: - Novel framework combining multiple techniques to optimize knowledge distillation. - Empirical validation across different architectures and datasets demonstrates robustness. - Clear presentation of the methodology and results showcasing performance improvements. Weaknesses: - Theoretical justification for the framework could be stronger; some assumptions are not deeply explored. - Limited discussion on the scalability of the proposed methods and their applicability to more complex architectures or larger datasets. - Comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art methods may provide a more comprehensive overview of MLDR-KD's position in the field. Overall, the paper contributes significant insights into relational knowledge distillation with practical implications across architectures. However, for those well-versed in the field, the conclusions feel somewhat incremental rather than groundbreaking given existing literature. Thus, while the contributions are valuable, they may not shift paradigms or practices as significantly as stronger, more transformative work. **Score: 7**

### Can LLMs Replace Human Evaluators? An Empirical Study of LLM-as-a-Judge in Software Engineering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06193v1)
- **Authors**: Ruiqi Wang, Jiyu Guo, Cuiyun Gao, Guodong Fan, Chun Yong Chong, Xin Xia
- **Abstract**: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been deployed to tackle various software engineering (SE) tasks like code generation, significantly advancing the automation of SE tasks. However, assessing the quality of these LLM-generated code and text remains challenging. The commonly used Pass@k metric necessitates extensive unit tests and configured environments, demands a high labor cost, and is not suitable for evaluating LLM-generated text. Conventional metrics like BLEU, which measure only lexical rather than semantic similarity, have also come under scrutiny. In response, a new trend has emerged to employ LLMs for automated evaluation, known as LLM-as-a-judge. These LLM-as-a-judge methods are claimed to better mimic human assessment than conventional metrics without relying on high-quality reference answers. Nevertheless, their exact human alignment in SE tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically explore LLM-as-a-judge methods for evaluating SE tasks, focusing on their alignment with human judgments. We select seven LLM-as-a-judge methods that utilize general-purpose LLMs, alongside two LLMs specifically fine-tuned for evaluation. After generating and manually scoring LLM responses on three recent SE datasets of code translation, code generation, and code summarization, we then prompt these methods to evaluate each response. Finally, we compare the scores generated by these methods with human evaluation. The results indicate that output-based methods reach the highest Pearson correlation of 81.32 and 68.51 with human scores in code translation and generation, achieving near-human evaluation, noticeably outperforming ChrF++, one of the best conventional metrics, at 34.23 and 64.92. Such output-based methods prompt LLMs to output judgments directly, and exhibit more balanced score distributions that resemble human score patterns. Finally, we provide...
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) in evaluating software engineering (SE) tasks, expressing a need for more effective assessment methods for code generated by LLMs. Traditional metrics like Pass@k and BLEU have been found inadequate due to high labor costs and poor semantic alignment, respectively. In contrast, the emerging LLM-as-a-judge methodology aims to improve assessment by mimicking human judgment without reliance on predefined quality references. The authors conduct an empirical evaluation using seven LLM-as-a-judge methods—both general-purpose and fine-tuned models—across three SE datasets (code translation, code generation, and code summarization). Their findings demonstrate that output-based assessment methods significantly correlate with human evaluations, outperforming conventional metrics both in correlation scores and distribution patterns. This showcases the potential effectiveness of using LLMs as evaluators in software engineering contexts. ### Evaluation: The paper presents key advancements in the field of software engineering by addressing the crucial issue of automated quality assessment of LLM-generated code. It successfully highlights the limitations of existing evaluation metrics and introduces promising LLM-based techniques. The empirical study provides substantial evidence supporting the hypothesis that LLMs can serve as effective evaluators, achieving high correlation with human judgments. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance**: With the growing reliance on AI-generated code, the issue of evaluation is highly pertinent. This paper directly addresses prevalent challenges in the field. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The study employs a thoughtful experimental design, evaluating a range of LLMs and methods, providing a clearer understanding of their effectiveness relative to human raters. 3. **Innovative Approach**: By proposing LLMs as evaluators, the research opens new avenues for automating quality assurance in software engineering and offers a direct contrast to traditional metrics. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Narrow Focus**: The analysis is limited to specific SE tasks and datasets, which may not encapsulate the full spectrum of software engineering challenges. Broader validation across diverse tasks could enhance generalizability. 2. **Human Judgment Nuance**: While LLMs demonstrate a high correlation with human judgments, the paper does not delve into the nuances of human evaluation, which can be subjective and context-dependent. 3. **Opacity of LLM Decisions**: The paper does not address the interpretability of LLM decisions; understanding why certain assessments are made is crucial if these models are to be employed in practice. Overall, the study is a notable contribution that advances the discourse surrounding LLMs' roles in evaluation, presenting compelling evidence of their capabilities. However, it could enhance its impact by broadening its scope and addressing the complexities of human assessment more deeply. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contributions and practical implications, balanced by the identification of areas that require further exploration for a more comprehensive understanding in the field of software engineering evaluation.

### Timing Matters: How Using LLMs at Different Timings Influences Writers' Perceptions and Ideation Outcomes in AI-Assisted Ideation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06197v1)
- **Authors**: Peinuan Qin, Chi-Lan Yang, Jingshu Li, Jing Wen, Yi-Chieh Lee
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to support ideation in the writing process. However, whether generating ideas with the help of LLMs leads to idea fixation or idea expansion is unclear. This study examines how different timings of LLM usage - either at the beginning or after independent ideation - affect people's perceptions and ideation outcomes in a writing task. In a controlled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using LLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and lowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes in autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation. We propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while considering users' self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the ideation outcomes.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper titled "Timing Matters: How Using LLMs at Different Timings Influences Writers' Perceptions and Ideation Outcomes in AI-Assisted Ideation" investigates the impact of the timing of Large Language Model (LLM) assistance on the ideation process in writing. Through a controlled experiment with 60 participants, the authors discovered that when LLMs were utilized at the beginning of the ideation process, it resulted in fewer original ideas and diminished feelings of creative self-efficacy and ownership. These effects were attributed to altered perceptions of autonomy and ownership over the generated ideas. The study concludes that delaying LLM usage until after independent ideation may enhance creative self-efficacy and feeling of ownership, thereby encouraging more original thought. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**   This paper addresses a pertinent question in the emerging intersection of AI and creative writing: the timing of AI assistance significantly influences ideation outcomes. The novelty lies in its exploration of this timing dimension, which has not been thoroughly investigated in prior research. It challenges existing paradigms by emphasizing not just the capability of LLMs in idea generation, but the psychological factors that govern the ideation process. **Strengths:**   1. **Empirical Investigation:** The use of a controlled experiment provides a rigorous framework for examining the effects of timing on ideation outcomes, lending credibility to the findings. 2. **Relevance:** As LLMs become increasingly integrated into creative processes, insights about their optimal use are crucial for educators, writers, and technologists. 3. **Theoretical Contribution:** The study provides a conceptual understanding of autonomy and ownership in creative tasks, which may inform future research in human-AI interaction. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Limited Sample Size:** With only 60 participants, the generalizability of the findings may be restricted. Larger and more diverse populations could yield different results. 2. **Context-Specific Findings:** The study may not account for various writing tasks and settings where LLMs could influence creativity differently. The findings are context-dependent and may not universally apply across different domains of writing. 3. **Lack of Longitudinal Insight:** The immediate effects of LLM usage are explored, but the long-term implications for writers' creative development remain unaddressed. **Conclusion:**   Overall, the paper presents valuable insights into the timing of LLM assistance in the ideation process. Its findings are significant for both theory and practice, urging practitioners to rethink how and when to implement LLMs in creative workflows. However, due to the limitations in sample size and the specific context of the study, the findings warrant cautious interpretation regarding broader applications. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with novel insights into timing and psychological impacts, while acknowledging limitations in sample representation and generalizability. The study serves as a catalyst for future exploration in understanding human-AI collaborative creativity.

### Non-literal Understanding of Number Words by Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06204v1)
- **Authors**: Polina Tsvilodub, Kanishk Gandhi, Haoran Zhao, Jan-Philipp Fränken, Michael Franke, Noah D. Goodman
- **Abstract**: Humans naturally interpret numbers non-literally, effortlessly combining context, world knowledge, and speaker intent. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) interpret numbers similarly, focusing on hyperbole and pragmatic halo effects. Through systematic comparison with human data and computational models of pragmatic reasoning, we find that LLMs diverge from human interpretation in striking ways. By decomposing pragmatic reasoning into testable components, grounded in the Rational Speech Act framework, we pinpoint where LLM processing diverges from human cognition -- not in prior knowledge, but in reasoning with it. This insight leads us to develop a targeted solution -- chain-of-thought prompting inspired by an RSA model makes LLMs' interpretations more human-like. Our work demonstrates how computational cognitive models can both diagnose AI-human differences and guide development of more human-like language understanding capabilities.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Non-literal Understanding of Number Words by Language Models" explores how large language models (LLMs) comprehend the non-literal use of numbers, such as hyperbole and pragmatic implications, alongside human cognition. It highlights that while humans utilize context, world knowledge, and speaker intent effectively in interpreting numbers, LLMs reveal significant divergences from this human behavior. Through rigorous testing based on the Rational Speech Act framework, the authors identify that LLM discrepancies stem from their reasoning process rather than their knowledge base. They propose a chain-of-thought prompting technique based on the RSA model to refine LLM interpretations to align more closely with human understanding. This work illustrates how cognitive models can shed light on AI-human differences and pave the way for enhancing LLM language comprehension capabilities. --- ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper addresses a timely and relevant issue within the rapidly evolving field of natural language processing (NLP) and AI, specifically the differing interpretations of numerical expressions between LLMs and humans. By providing empirical evidence that LLMs struggle with non-literal interpretations where humans typically excel, the authors contribute to our understanding of the limitations of current models. The use of the Rational Speech Act framework to analyze pragmatic reasoning is a compelling approach that adds depth to the investigation of LLM understanding. Additionally, the introduction of chain-of-thought prompting as a potential remedy offers a practical advancement in improving LLMs, showcasing an innovative application of cognitive theory to AI. **Strengths:** 1. **Insightful Framework:** Utilizing the Rational Speech Act model provides a structured way to dissect LLM performance and aligns with cognitive linguistic theories. 2. **Practical Implications:** The proposed chain-of-thought prompting strategy suggests actionable steps for enhancing model interpretations, making the research not only theoretical but also practical. 3. **Comparative Analysis:** The systematic comparison with human cognition adds a robust benchmark for understanding the nuanced differences between human and LLM processing. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Contextual Limitations:** While the study highlights divergences, it does not extensively explore how various contexts or types of numerical expressions affect the interpretation, which could enrich findings. 2. **Generality of Findings:** The research may benefit from diverse datasets beyond those examined to ensure findings are generalizable across different LLMs and linguistic contexts. 3. **Focus on Hyperbole:** The focus primarily on hyperbolic expressions might limit the exploration of other types of non-literal expressions, such as metaphor and irony, which could further extend the utility of the findings. **Potential Influence:** This research has the potential to influence future studies in both AI and cognitive science by providing a clearer understanding of how language models can be made to interpret numbers similarly to humans. It sets a foundation for further investigation into pragmatic language features, pushing the frontier of human-like language understanding in AI. **Overall Assessment:** Given the study's contributions, the thoughtful application of cognitive frameworks, and the practical implications of its findings, the paper merits a high score. However, its current limitations in diversity of context and scope temper the rating slightly. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Guoxin Chen, Minpeng Liao, Peiying Yu, Dingmin Wang, Zile Qiao, Chao Yang, Xin Zhao, Kai Fan
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face a fundamental challenge in aligning independently developed retrievers and large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches typically involve modifying either component or introducing simple intermediate modules, resulting in practical limitations and sub-optimal performance. Inspired by human search behavior -- typically involving a back-and-forth process of proposing search queries and reviewing documents, we propose C-3PO, a proxy-centric framework that facilitates communication between retrievers and LLMs through a lightweight multi-agent system. Our framework implements three specialized agents that collaboratively optimize the entire RAG pipeline without altering the retriever and LLMs. These agents work together to assess the need for retrieval, generate effective queries, and select information suitable for the LLMs. To enable effective multi-agent coordination, we develop a tree-structured rollout approach for reward credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments in both in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios demonstrate that C-3PO significantly enhances RAG performance while maintaining plug-and-play flexibility and superior generalization capabilities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents C-3PO, a novel framework designed to optimize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It addresses the challenge of aligning retrievers and large language models (LLMs) by utilizing a lightweight, multi-agent system that does not require alterations to either component. C-3PO features three specialized agents tasked with improving the RAG process: they assess retrieval needs, generate search queries, and select relevant information for LLMs. The framework employs a tree-structured rollout method to enhance coordination among agents through reinforcement learning. Experiments show that C-3PO significantly improves RAG performance in various scenarios while preserving flexibility in implementation. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:**  C-3PO represents a significant advancement in the field of retrieval-augmented generation by introducing a structured, agent-based approach that facilitates effective interaction between retrievers and LLMs without the need for direct modifications to either component. While the use of multi-agent systems is not new, the specific application to optimize RAG systems and the unique tree-structured rollout mechanism for learning in this context are notable innovations that set this work apart from previous efforts. **Strengths:** 1. **Practicality:** The framework's plug-and-play nature allows for easy integration with existing retrievers and LLMs, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios. 2. **Performance:** The reported improvements in both in-domain and out-of-distribution contexts demonstrate robustness and adaptability, suggesting its potential applicability across diverse tasks and datasets. 3. **Reinforcement Learning Approach:** The novel reward assignment mechanism could provide a new perspective and methodology for future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** While the multi-agent system enhances performance, it may introduce complexity in understanding and managing the interactions between agents, which could hinder deployment in simpler applications. 2. **Evaluation Scope:** The paper concentrates primarily on performance metrics; a more in-depth exploration of the computational efficiency and scalability of the C-3PO system would add depth to the findings. 3. **Comparative Context:** While the results are promising, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods to establish the relative advantage of C-3PO. Overall, the strengths in innovation, practical applicability, and improved performance support a high score, while some concerns regarding complexity and comparative analysis limit its impact.  **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: LLMs are widely used for offensive language detection due to their advanced capability. However, the challenges posed by human annotation disagreement in real-world datasets remain underexplored. These disagreement samples are difficult to detect due to their ambiguous nature. Additionally, the confidence of LLMs in processing disagreement samples can provide valuable insights into their alignment with human annotators. To address this gap, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to detect offensive language with annotation disagreement. We compare the binary accuracy of multiple LLMs across varying annotation agreement levels and analyze the relationship between LLM confidence and annotation agreement. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of disagreement samples on LLM decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings highlight the challenges posed by disagreement samples and offer guidance for improving LLM-based offensive language detection.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in detecting offensive language amidst human annotation disagreement—a factor that has not been thoroughly examined in existing literature. The authors analyze how varying levels of agreement among human annotators impact the LLMs’ performance and confidence in identifying offensive language. They conduct a comparative study by evaluating the binary accuracy of several LLMs while also examining the influence of disagreement samples on LLM performance in settings such as few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. The study reveals the inherent challenges posed by ambiguous disagreement samples, suggesting that better understanding and handling of these disagreements can enhance LLM capabilities in offensive language detection. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper addresses a relatively underexplored area in the application of LLMs—how human annotation disagreement affects their language detection abilities. By systematically evaluating this aspect, the authors contribute novel insights into the limitations and performance variabilities of LLMs when confronted with ambiguous data, which is particularly relevant in real-world scenarios.  **Significance:** The findings have significant implications for both researchers and practitioners in natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the domain of content moderation and safety applications. By highlighting the nuances of LLM performance in the context of disagreement, the work provides a pathway for refining language models to improve their reliability and robustness. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance**: The research is highly relevant in the current landscape, where LLMs are widely deployed for sensitive tasks like offensive language detection. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The systematic evaluation across different models and contexts, such as few-shot learning, offers a comprehensive insight into performance metrics. 3. **Practical Insights**: The focus on how to enhance LLM effectiveness when encountering annotation disagreements could lead to practical advancements in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the study addresses the issue of annotation disagreement, it may not explore other potentially confounding factors affecting LLM performance, such as cultural context or the evolving nature of language. 2. **Generalizability**: Depending on the annotation datasets used, the findings may not generalize across all types of offensive language or all cultural contexts, which could limit broader applicability. **Overall Assessment:** While the paper provides valuable insights into the interaction between LLM capabilities and human annotation disagreement, its limitations note the complexity of the issue within broader NLP challenges. Still, it contributes to the understanding and improvement of LLMs in practical applications. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contribution to understanding the complexities of LLM performance in real-world scenarios, with a solid methodological framework that enhances the field's discourse.

### LessLeak-Bench: A First Investigation of Data Leakage in LLMs Across 83 Software Engineering Benchmarks
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06215v1)
- **Authors**: Xin Zhou, Martin Weyssow, Ratnadira Widyasari, Ting Zhang, Junda He, Yunbo Lyu, Jianming Chang, Beiqi Zhang, Dan Huang, David Lo
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely utilized in software engineering (SE) tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. However, their reliance on extensive and often undisclosed pre-training datasets raises significant concerns about data leakage, where the evaluation benchmark data is unintentionally ``seen'' by LLMs during the model's construction phase. The data leakage issue could largely undermine the validity of LLM-based research and evaluations. Despite the increasing use of LLMs in the SE community, there is no comprehensive study that assesses the extent of data leakage in SE benchmarks for LLMs yet. To address this gap, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis of data leakage in 83 SE benchmarks concerning LLMs. Our results show that in general, data leakage in SE benchmarks is minimal, with average leakage ratios of only 4.8\%, 2.8\%, and 0.7\% for Python, Java, and C/C++ benchmarks, respectively. However, some benchmarks exhibit relatively higher leakage ratios, which raises concerns about their bias in evaluation. For instance, QuixBugs and BigCloneBench have leakage ratios of 100.0\% and 55.7\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observe that data leakage has a substantial impact on LLM evaluation. We also identify key causes of high data leakage, such as the direct inclusion of benchmark data in pre-training datasets and the use of coding platforms like LeetCode for benchmark construction. To address the data leakage, we introduce \textbf{LessLeak-Bench}, a new benchmark that removes leaked samples from the 83 SE benchmarks, enabling more reliable LLM evaluations in future research. Our study enhances the understanding of data leakage in SE benchmarks and provides valuable insights for future research involving LLMs in SE.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "LessLeak-Bench: A First Investigation of Data Leakage in LLMs Across 83 Software Engineering Benchmarks" explores the critical issue of data leakage in Large Language Models (LLMs) when employed in software engineering tasks. The authors conduct a comprehensive analysis of 83 benchmarks to assess the prevalence and impact of data leakage, which occurs when the model encounters evaluation data during its training phase. Their findings reveal that, while the overall data leakage is relatively low across most benchmarks—averaging 4.8% for Python, 2.8% for Java, and 0.7% for C/C++—certain benchmarks like QuixBugs and BigCloneBench exhibit significant leakage ratios of 100% and 55.7%, respectively, raising concerns about their evaluative integrity. The paper attributes higher leakage rates to practices such as the direct use of benchmark data in pre-training and reliance on specific coding platforms for benchmark design. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a new benchmark, LessLeak-Bench, which filters leaked samples, thereby improving the reliability of LLM evaluations in software engineering contexts. Overall, the paper highlights critical implications for future research with LLMs in software engineering. --- **Evaluation of the Paper's Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Originality**: This study is the first of its kind to systematically analyze data leakage within software engineering benchmarks applied to LLMs, filling a notable gap in existing literature.  2. **Relevance**: Given the increasing reliance on LLMs in software development tasks, understanding data leakage is crucial for ensuring the integrity and validity of their evaluations. 3. **Practical Contribution**: The introduction of the LessLeak-Bench benchmark is a significant practical contribution that provides a tool for future research, facilitating more accurate assessments of LLM capabilities. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Analysis**: While the paper covers 83 benchmarks, it would benefit from a deeper qualitative assessment of how individual benchmark characteristics contribute to data leakage, beyond just the numerical leakage ratios. 2. **Generalizability of Findings**: The findings may be constrained to the specific context of software engineering and may not fully extend to other fields using LLMs, limiting its broader applicability. 3. **Potential for Overemphasis on Leakage**: While acknowledging the implications of data leakage, the authors should discuss ways in which leakage does not always equate to invalid results or models, allowing for a more nuanced interpretation of its impact. **Influence on the Field**: The paper provides critical insights that could shape how future research is conducted in the software engineering arena, directly impacting the evaluation strategies for LLMs. The introduction of LessLeak-Bench could influence practices around benchmark creation and validation, making it a significant step towards improving the robustness of evaluations in this area. **Conclusion**:  The paper addresses an important issue in a rapidly evolving field, providing both a solid empirical analysis and a valuable resource for future research. Its impact on the community is likely to be substantial if the proposed solutions are adopted widely. **Score: 8**  The score of 8 reflects the paper's noteworthy contributions while recognizing opportunities for deeper analysis and broader applicability. The combination of empirical results and practical solutions positions the work favorably in the landscape of research concerning LLMs in software engineering.

### K-ON: Stacking Knowledge On the Head Layer of Large Language Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06257v1)
- **Authors**: Lingbing Guo, Yichi Zhang, Zhongpu Bo, Zhuo Chen, Mengshu Sun, Zhiqiang Zhang, Wen Zhang, Huajun Chen
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Typically, LLMs are trained to predict the next token, aligning well with many NLP tasks. However, in knowledge graph (KG) scenarios, entities are the fundamental units and identifying an entity requires at least several tokens. This leads to a granularity mismatch between KGs and natural languages. To address this issue, we propose K-ON, which integrates KG knowledge into the LLM by employing multiple head layers for next k-step prediction. K-ON can not only generate entity-level results in one step, but also enables contrastive loss against entities, which is the most powerful tool in KG representation learning. Experimental results show that K-ON outperforms state-of-the-art methods that incorporate text and even the other modalities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "K-ON: Stacking Knowledge On the Head Layer of Large Language Model" addresses the mismatch between the granularity of knowledge graphs (KGs) and large language models (LLMs) in the context of natural language processing (NLP). While LLMs focus on predicting the next token based on language patterns, they struggle with tasks that require understanding multi-token entities typical in KGs. K-ON introduces an innovative framework that integrates KG information with LLMs through multiple head layers for next k-step prediction, thus allowing for more precise entity-level outputs. Additionally, it employs a contrastive loss mechanism to enhance entity representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that K-ON outperforms existing methods that leverage both text and other modalities, highlighting its efficiency in bridging KGs and LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the K-ON framework is notable, as it addresses a significant and often overlooked challenge in the intersection of NLP and KGs. By employing a multi-layer approach, it effectively aligns the capabilities of LLMs with the structural requirements of KGs, which is a relevant issue given the rise of entity-centric applications. The introduction of contrastive loss for entity representation is particularly powerful, as it enhances the model's ability to distinguish between different entities, thus improving accuracy in knowledge-based tasks. The strengths of the paper lie in its clear framing of the problem, a well-justified methodology for integrating KG knowledge into LLMs, and robust experimental validation demonstrating superiority over existing methods. This provides strong evidence for its practical application in real-world NLP tasks involving KGs. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper does not extensively discuss the potential limitations or challenges in scaling the approach to larger datasets or more complex entity types, which could impact the generalizability of the results. Moreover, while the experimental results are promising, they would benefit from comparative analyses involving a broader range of baseline methods and perhaps a discussion of real-world applications where K-ON can be particularly impactful. Overall, considering the innovative approach, effective application of contrastive loss, and the substantiation of results, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field. However, the lack of in-depth discussions on limitations and broader applicability slightly reduces its impact. **Score: 8**

### Emergent Response Planning in LLM
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06258v1)
- **Authors**: Zhichen Dong, Zhanhui Zhou, Zhixuan Liu, Chao Yang, Chaochao Lu
- **Abstract**: In this work, we argue that large language models (LLMs), though trained to predict only the next token, exhibit emergent planning behaviors: $\textbf{their hidden representations encode future outputs beyond the next token}$. Through simple probing, we demonstrate that LLM prompt representations encode global attributes of their entire responses, including $\textit{structural attributes}$ (response length, reasoning steps), $\textit{content attributes}$ (character choices in storywriting, multiple-choice answers at the end of response), and $\textit{behavioral attributes}$ (answer confidence, factual consistency). In addition to identifying response planning, we explore how it scales with model size across tasks and how it evolves during generation. The findings that LLMs plan ahead for the future in their hidden representations suggests potential applications for improving transparency and generation control.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Emergent Response Planning in LLM" investigates the phenomenon of emergent planning behaviors in large language models (LLMs). Despite being trained primarily for next-token prediction, the authors argue that LLMs possess hidden representations that encapsulate information about future responses beyond just the immediate next token. Through probing techniques, the study identifies that these prompt representations can capture various global attributes of responses, categorized into structural (like response length and reasoning steps), content (such as character choices and answers), and behavioral attributes (including answer confidence and factual consistency). The authors examine how these emergent planning capabilities scale with model size across different tasks and analyze their evolution during the text generation process. The findings highlight the implications for enhancing transparency in LLMs and facilitating greater control over their generative outputs. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy exploration of an under-researched aspect of LLMs—how these models might internally organize and plan for the entirety of their outputs based on initial prompts. The identification of global attributes in hidden representations is a significant contribution, as it adds to our understanding of LLM mechanisms and suggests practical applications in improving LLM transparency and controllability. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The notion that LLMs can encode planning mechanisms for responses may reshape the understanding of their operational capacities, pushing the boundaries of what we perceive as constraints in LLM design. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of probing to analyze hidden representations illustrates a strong methodological framework, allowing for a nuanced examination of latent behaviors. 3. **Scalability Insights:** The exploration of how these planning behaviors scale with model size provides valuable insights for researchers looking to optimize LLM architectures. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization of Findings:** While the paper presents compelling findings, the degree to which these observations hold across various types of tasks and different architectures could be further clarified. 2. **Lack of Complex Mechanisms Discussion:** Although planning is discussed, the mechanisms underlying these emergent behaviors are not deeply analyzed, which could limit the understanding of how to harness or replicate these features. 3. **Empirical Validation Needed:** The claims are primarily based on probing methods, and there is a potential need for more direct empirical validation through task performance or user studies. Overall, while the paper possesses significant insights and practical implications, its limitations in generalization and deeper theoretical exploration downplay its transformative impact in the landscape of LLM research. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to understanding LLMs while also indicating that it could benefit from deeper exploration of its findings and broader applicability across diverse tasks and models.

- **Authors**: Utkarsh Tiwari, Aryan Seth, Adi Mukherjee, Kaavya Mer, Kavish, Dhruv Kumar
- **Abstract**: We introduce DebateBench, a novel dataset consisting of an extensive collection of transcripts and metadata from some of the world's most prestigious competitive debates. The dataset consists of British Parliamentary debates from prestigious debating tournaments on diverse topics, annotated with detailed speech-level scores and house rankings sourced from official adjudication data. We curate 256 speeches across 32 debates with each debate being over 1 hour long with each input being an average of 32,000 tokens. Designed to capture long-context, large-scale reasoning tasks, DebateBench provides a benchmark for evaluating modern large language models (LLMs) on their ability to engage in argumentation, deliberation, and alignment with human experts. To do well on DebateBench, the LLMs must perform in-context learning to understand the rules and evaluation criteria of the debates, then analyze 8 seven minute long speeches and reason about the arguments presented by all speakers to give the final results. Our preliminary evaluation using GPT o1, GPT-4o, and Claude Haiku, shows that LLMs struggle to perform well on DebateBench, highlighting the need to develop more sophisticated techniques for improving their performance.

### Utilizing Novelty-based Evolution Strategies to Train Transformers in Reinforcement Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06301v1)
- **Authors**: Matyáš Lorenc
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we experiment with novelty-based variants of OpenAI-ES, the NS-ES and NSR-ES algorithms, and evaluate their effectiveness in training complex, transformer-based architectures designed for the problem of reinforcement learning such as Decision Transformers. We also test if we can accelerate the novelty-based training of these larger models by seeding the training by a pretrained models. By this, we build on our previous work, where we tested the ability of evolution strategies - specifically the aforementioned OpenAI-ES - to train the Decision Transformer architecture. The results were mixed. NS-ES showed progress, but it would clearly need many more iterations for it to yield interesting results. NSR-ES, on the other hand, proved quite capable of being straightforwardly used on larger models, since its performance appears as similar between the feed-forward model and Decision Transformer, as it was for the OpenAI-ES in our previous work.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the application of novelty-based evolution strategies (NS-ES and NSR-ES) on transformer architectures in reinforcement learning, particularly focusing on Decision Transformers. Building on prior research where OpenAI-ES was tested on Decision Transformers, the authors investigate whether seeding training with pretrained models can enhance the effectiveness of these novel strategies. The findings indicate that while NS-ES showed initial progress, it requires more iterations for substantial results. In contrast, NSR-ES demonstrated effective performance across larger models, with results comparable to those obtained using OpenAI-ES. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents several noteworthy aspects: 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The exploration of novelty-based evolution strategies in training transformer models within the reinforcement learning landscape is relatively underexplored. The focus on applying these strategies to Decision Transformers adds a new layer of understanding to the effectiveness of evolutionary methods. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** The inclusion of comparative analyses (e.g., between NS-ES, NSR-ES, and OpenAI-ES) strengthens the methodology. The use of pretrained models as a seeding mechanism is a forward-thinking approach that could inspire further research into hybrid training methods. 3. **Mixed Results:** The results were not uniformly positive; NS-ES required extensive iterations without meaningful gains, which highlights potential limitations in its applicability. Although NSR-ES performed well, this suggests that while one novelty-based strategy shows promise, others may not be as effective in the context of larger models. 4. **Significance to the Field:** The paper contributes to the ongoing discussion in AI about the efficacy of combining evolutionary strategies with deep learning, specifically within the reinforcement learning domain. However, the limited performance of one of the strategies (NS-ES) may temper the overall significance. **Strengths:** - Addresses a gap in the application of evolutionary strategies to transformer architectures. - Provides empirical data and insights into model training dynamics. - Expands on a previous study, adding depth to the existing knowledge. **Weaknesses:** - Mixed results may indicate the need for more extensive research before drawing firm conclusions about the viability of these strategies. - The paper might lack comprehensive evaluations of potential implications or future directions arising from the findings. Considering these points, the paper offers a meaningful contribution while also highlighting important challenges in the application of novelty-based strategies in training large language models for reinforcement learning. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a balanced perspective on the paper's contributions and limitations, indicating that while the work is significant and offers valuable insights, it also faces challenges that reduce its immediate impact within the field.

- **Authors**: Patricia Porretta, Sylvester Pakenham, Huxley Ainsworth, Gregory Chatten, Godfrey Allerton, Simon Hollingsworth, Vance Periwinkle
- **Abstract**: Token prediction stability remains a challenge in autoregressive generative models, where minor variations in early inference steps often lead to significant semantic drift over extended sequences. A structured modulation mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Latent Convergence Modulation in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Iterative Contextual Realignment" addresses a significant issue in autoregressive generative models, specifically the stability of token prediction.

Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both cell nuclei detection and classification tasks. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of CellNuc-DETR on large WSIs, showing that it not only outperforms current methods in accuracy but also significantly reduces inference times. Specifically, CellNuc-DETR is twice as fast as the fastest segmentation-based method, HoVer-NeXt, while achieving substantially higher accuracy. Moreover, it surpasses CellViT in accuracy and is approximately ten times more efficient in inference speed on WSIs. These results establish CellNuc-DETR as a superior approach for cell analysis in digital pathology, combining high accuracy with computational efficiency.

These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to assist in patent evaluation, reducing the workload for both examiners and applicants. Our contributions highlight the limitations of current models and provide a foundation for improving AI-driven patent analysis through advanced models and refined datasets.

- **Abstract**: Soft-tissue surgeries, such as tumor resections, are complicated by tissue deformations that can obscure the accurate location and shape of tissues. By representing tissue surfaces as point clouds and applying non-rigid point cloud registration (PCR) methods, surgeons can better understand tissue deformations before, during, and after surgery. Existing non-rigid PCR methods, such as feature-based approaches, struggle with robustness against challenges like noise, outliers, partial data, and large deformations, making accurate point correspondence difficult. Although learning-based PCR methods, particularly Transformer-based approaches, have recently shown promise due to their attention mechanisms for capturing interactions, their robustness remains limited in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we present DefTransNet, a novel end-to-end Transformer-based architecture for non-rigid PCR. DefTransNet is designed to address the key challenges of deformable registration, including large deformations, outliers, noise, and partial data, by inputting source and target point clouds and outputting displacement vector fields. The proposed method incorporates a learnable transformation matrix to enhance robustness to affine transformations, integrates global and local geometric information, and captures long-range dependencies among points using Transformers. We validate our approach on four datasets: ModelNet, SynBench, 4DMatch, and DeformedTissue, using both synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the generalization of our proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that DefTransNet outperforms current state-of-the-art registration networks across various challenging conditions. Our code and data are publicly available.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents DefTransNet, a Transformer-based method aimed at improving non-rigid point cloud registration (PCR) in the context of soft-tissue deformation during surgeries. The authors address the limitations of existing non-rigid PCR techniques, particularly feature-based approaches, which often fail in the presence of noise, outliers, partial data, and large deformations. DefTransNet introduces an end-to-end architecture that processes point clouds to output displacement vector fields, integrating a learnable transformation matrix to enhance robustness and utilizing Transformers to capture both local and global geometric relationships among points. The method was validated across four datasets, showing superior performance against state-of-the-art registration networks under various challenging conditions. The authors provide their code and data publicly, making their contributions accessible for further research. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Architecture**: The introduction of DefTransNet as a Transformer-based model tailored for non-rigid PCR is a significant advancement, leveraging the strengths of Transformers to manage complex relationships within the data. 2. **Robustness to Challenges**: By directly addressing the common challenges in non-rigid registration—like noise, large deformations, and partiality—the paper provides a noteworthy contribution to the field. 3. **Comprehensive Validation**: The authors validated their method against multiple diverse datasets, including synthetic and real-world data, which enhances the credibility and applicability of their findings. 4. **Public Accessibility**: Making code and data publicly available is a strong point, encouraging further exploration and validation by the community. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparison with Baselines**: While the paper claims to outperform state-of-the-art methods, a more detailed exploration of comparative performances and limitations would strengthen the claims. 2. **Potential Computational Complexity**: The use of Transformers, while beneficial for capturing dependencies, might introduce computational complexity. The practical implications for real-time applications in surgery are not sufficiently discussed. 3. **Testing on Real Surgical Data**: More emphasis on testing within actual surgical scenarios may improve the significance; real-world validation is essential in surgical applications. 4. **Generalizability**: Although results on four datasets are promising, the potential limitations regarding the types of deformations in those datasets compared to real-life scenarios may impact generalizability. Overall, while DefTransNet shows substantial promise and introduces innovative elements to the field of non-rigid PCR, the evaluation methods and certain practical implementations require further elucidation. The approach addresses significant issues, and its application to soft-tissue surgeries is particularly relevant. ### Score: 8 This score reflects the paper's strong contributions to the field, particularly in developing a novel method that addresses major challenges in non-rigid PCR. However, some shortcomings in comparative analysis and practical application indicate areas for further development.

### Zero-shot Depth Completion via Test-time Alignment with Affine-invariant Depth Prior
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06338v1)
- **Authors**: Lee Hyoseok, Kyeong Seon Kim, Kwon Byung-Ki, Tae-Hyun Oh
- **Abstract**: Depth completion, predicting dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements, is an ill-posed problem requiring prior knowledge. Recent methods adopt learning-based approaches to implicitly capture priors, but the priors primarily fit in-domain data and do not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a zero-shot depth completion method composed of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment. We use pre-trained depth diffusion models as depth prior knowledge, which implicitly understand how to fill in depth for scenes. Our approach aligns the affine-invariant depth prior with metric-scale sparse measurements, enforcing them as hard constraints via an optimization loop at test-time. Our zero-shot depth completion method demonstrates generalization across various domain datasets, achieving up to a 21\% average performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods while enhancing spatial understanding by sharpening scene details. We demonstrate that aligning a monocular affine-invariant depth prior with sparse metric measurements is a proven strategy to achieve domain-generalizable depth completion without relying on extensive training data. Project page: https://hyoseok1223.github.io/zero-shot-depth-completion/.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel zero-shot depth completion method that predicts dense depth maps from sparse measurements, focusing on enhancing generalization across out-of-domain datasets. It leverages a combination of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment to improve the process. By aligning pre-trained depth priors with sparse metric measurements within an optimization loop, the proposed method effectively fills in depth information for various scenes while imposing hard constraints. The results show a significant performance boost, achieving up to a 21% improvement over the current state-of-the-art and enhancing spatial detail understanding without the need for extensive training data. --- **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty:** The paper introduces an innovative approach to depth completion that diverges from traditional in-domain learning-based methods. The use of an affine-invariant depth prior combined with a test-time alignment strategy is noteworthy. Traditional methods often struggle to generalize across varying data domains, making this approach significant as it offers a solution to a well-acknowledged limitation in the field. 2. **Technical Rigor:** The utilization of depth diffusion models as priors and the optimization loop for alignment presents a technically sound framework. The authors provide strong experimental evidence to support their claims of improved performance and spatial detail enhancement, which adds credibility to their approach. 3. **Impact:** The ability to perform depth completion without extensive training data is a valuable advancement, especially in contexts where data availability is limited. This ensures that the research could have practical implications for various applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics, thereby enhancing its significance in real-world settings. 4. **Generalization:** Demonstrating that the method applies successfully across multiple datasets is a strength, showcasing the potential for broader applicability. However, the exact conditions under which the method excels or struggles could have been elaborated further, offering insights into potential limitations. 5. **Clarity and Presentation:** The paper articulates its methodology and findings clearly, making it accessible to a broader audience. However, a more detailed discussion on potential shortcomings of the approach and comparisons with a wider range of existing methods could strengthen the paper's quality. 6. **Future Work:** While the paper lays a strong foundation, it could benefit from proposed future avenues of research, particularly regarding the adaptability of the method to even more diverse datasets and the potential integration with other learning paradigms. Given these considerations, I rate the paper an **8 out of 10**.  **Score: 8** **Rationale:** The research demonstrates a significant advance in the depth completion field, particularly with its zero-shot learning aspect and effective use of prior knowledge. However, while it is an important contribution that pushes the boundaries of existing methodologies, full exploration of its limitations and comparisons with an even broader spectrum of current approaches could elevate its impact further.

- **Abstract**: Fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence, particularly when trained on small datasets, resulting in poor calibration and inaccurate uncertainty estimates. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL), an uncertainty-aware approach, enables uncertainty estimation in a single forward pass, making it a promising method for calibrating fine-tuned LLMs. However, despite its computational efficiency, EDL is prone to overfitting, as its training objective can result in overly concentrated probability distributions. To mitigate this, we propose regularizing EDL by incorporating an information bottleneck (IB). Our approach IB-EDL suppresses spurious information in the evidence generated by the model and encourages truly predictive information to influence both the predictions and uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments across various fine-tuned LLMs and tasks demonstrate that IB-EDL outperforms both existing EDL and non-EDL approaches. By improving the trustworthiness of LLMs, IB-EDL facilitates their broader adoption in domains requiring high levels of confidence calibration. Code is available at https://github.com/sandylaker/ib-edl.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the calibration of large language models (LLMs), which tend to be overconfident, especially when fine-tuned on smaller datasets. The authors introduce Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method for uncertainty estimation during inference, but highlight its susceptibility to overfitting and concentration in probability distributions. To counteract this issue, they propose a novel regularization technique called Information Bottleneck Evidential Deep Learning (IB-EDL), which reduces spurious information in model evidence and focuses on predictive accuracy. Through extensive experimental evaluation, they demonstrate that IB-EDL significantly enhances the performance of fine-tuned LLMs in terms of calibration and trustworthiness compared to existing EDL and non-EDL methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in the integration of the Information Bottleneck (IB) concept into the framework of Evidential Deep Learning for LLM calibration. This combination addresses a critical issue in machine learning - model overconfidence and subsequent miscalibration, particularly in scenarios where data is scarce. The paper's method is well-structured, and the experiments show promising results across several fine-tuned LLMs, which indicates a thorough validation of the proposed approach. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of IB to mitigate overfitting in EDL is a novel approach that adds depth to the current understanding of uncertainty estimation for LLMs. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The extensive experiments conducted across various tasks bolster the reliability of the findings and provide a solid baseline comparison. 3. **Practical Implications**: By addressing calibration issues, the proposed method has practical implications for fields where uncertainty estimation is crucial, potentially expanding the utility of LLMs in more sensitive applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Generality of Results**: While the results are significant, the performance may vary across different datasets and model architectures not included in the study, which raises questions about the universality of the proposed method. 2. **Theoretical Justification**: A deeper theoretical underpinning regarding how the Information Bottleneck specifically aids in maintaining predictive information without overfitting would strengthen the discussion and appeal to academically rigorous audiences. 3. **Complexity and Interpretability**: The introduction of additional regularization techniques may complicate the training process and model interpretation, which might deter practitioners. Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of LLMs by addressing a relevant challenge in uncertainty estimation and calibration with an innovative solution. While it raises valuable insights and shows promising results, its broader applicability and theoretical grounding could use further exploration. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Tatsuhiro Eguchi, Shumpei Takezaki, Mihoko Shimano, Takayuki Yagi, Ryoma Bise
- **Abstract**: Photoacoustic(PA) imaging is a non-destructive and non-invasive technology for visualizing minute blood vessel structures in the body using ultrasonic sensors. In PA imaging, the image quality of a single-shot image is poor, and it is necessary to improve the image quality by averaging many single-shot images. Therefore, imaging the entire subject requires high imaging costs. In our study, we propose a method to improve the quality of PA images using diffusion models. In our method, we improve the reverse diffusion process using sensor information of PA imaging and introduce a guidance method using imaging condition information to generate high-quality images.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to enhance the quality of photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which typically suffers from low image quality when capturing single-shot images. The authors propose using guidance-based diffusion models to improve the reverse diffusion process by incorporating sensor information specific to PA imaging. This method aims to enhance image quality using contextual imaging condition data, potentially minimizing the need for averaging multiple images and reducing overall imaging costs. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The proposed method to enhance PA imaging quality through guidance-based diffusion models represents a notable step forward in the ongoing efforts to improve non-invasive imaging techniques. Traditionally, the reliance on averaging multiple single-shot images has limited the feasibility of efficient and cost-effective imaging, particularly for real-time applications. By leveraging advanced diffusion models, the authors tackle this challenge directly, suggesting a method that not only enhances the imaging outcome but may also reduce operational costs and increase accessibility of the technology. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of diffusion models to enhance PA imaging directly addresses a key deficiency in current methodologies. 2. **Potential Cost Reduction:** By mitigating the need for multiple images, the method may streamline the imaging process and reduce costs. 3. **Interdisciplinary Relevance:** This research intersects the fields of medical imaging, machine learning, and signal processing, suggesting broad applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Validation and Comparisons:** The paper does not sufficiently discuss the validation of the proposed diffusion model against established techniques or evaluate its performance rigorously. 2. **Parameter Sensitivity:** There may be concerns regarding the sensitivity of the model parameters, and without thorough analysis, it is difficult to ascertain the robustness of the results across varying conditions. 3. **Limited Real-world Application Testing:** The actual implementation of this model in clinical settings is not addressed, which raises questions about its practical usability. **Potential Influence:** While the method shows promise, its applicability depends on rigorous validation and testing across diverse imaging conditions. If successful, it could significantly enhance photoacoustic imaging's status in medical diagnostics, but real-world impact hinges on further research. **Score: 7**   This score reflects substantial novelty and a meaningful contribution to the field, though tempered by the need for detailed validation and real-world application insights. The paper is significant, but its practical implications require further exploration.

- **Authors**: Timo Fudala, Vasileios Tsouvalas, Nirvana Meratnia
- **Abstract**: Multimodal transformers integrate diverse data types like images, audio, and text, advancing tasks such as audio-visual understanding and image-text retrieval; yet their high parameterization limits deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Split Learning (SL), which partitions models at a designated cut-layer to offload compute-intensive operations to the server, offers a promising approach for distributed training of multimodal transformers, though its application remains underexplored. We present MPSL, a parallel SL approach for computational efficient fine-tuning of multimodal transformers in a distributed manner, while eliminating label sharing, client synchronization, and per-client sub-model management. MPSL employs lightweight client-side tokenizers and a unified modality-agnostic encoder, allowing flexible adaptation to task-specific needs. Our evaluation across 7 multimodal datasets demonstrates that MPSL matches or outperforms Federated Learning, reduces client-side computations by 250x, and achieves superior scalability in communication cost with model growth. Through extensive analysis, we highlight task suitability, trade-offs, and scenarios where MPSL excels, inspiring further exploration.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Fine-tuning Multimodal Transformers on Edge: A Parallel Split Learning Approach" introduces MPSL, a novel parallel split learning (SL) method aimed at efficiently fine-tuning multimodal transformers on resource-constrained edge devices. It addresses the challenges posed by high model parameterization, which hinders the deployment of multimodal systems that process various data types (like images, audio, and text) simultaneously. MPSL allows for distributed training by offloading heavy computations to a server while avoiding issues like label sharing and client synchronization. It utilizes lightweight client-side tokenizers and a unified modality-agnostic encoder to cater to task-specific needs. Evaluation on seven multimodal datasets shows that MPSL not only matches or surpasses federated learning performance but also reduces client-side computations significantly while offering better scalability as model sizes increase. The paper discusses various scenarios where MPSL is particularly effective, providing insights into its advantages over existing approaches.  **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty:**    - The paper introduces a new approach (MPSL) to tackle the challenges of fine-tuning multimodal transformers in edge environments, which is a pressing issue given the growing interest in edge computing.    - By situating the method within the framework of split learning—a concept that has found limited application in multimodal contexts—the paper fills a gap in the existing literature. 2. **Significance:**    - The findings that MPSL significantly reduces client-side computations (by 250x) and has superior scalability characteristics have substantial implications for the field. This could enable broader adoption of multimodal models in edge applications, where computational resources are often limited.    - In discussing the practical implications and detailed trade-offs, the authors contribute valuable insights conducive to further research and application development. 3. **Strengths:**    - The paper provides a thorough evaluation across multiple datasets, lending credibility to the findings and encouraging reproducibility.    - The framework's flexibility and adaptability to different tasks broadens its potential applicability. 4. **Weaknesses:**    - While the proposed method shows promise, the depth of analysis could be enhanced by including more real-world scenarios or potential limitations of the approach in diverse environments.    - There is less focus on the qualitative aspects of model performance—such as output quality—when models grow in size or complexity. 5. **Potential Influence:**    - The methodology and findings may influence future research on distributed learning frameworks, especially in practical applications of multimodal processing on edge devices.    - It could spur more exploration into the intersection of multimodal transformers and lightweight learning methods. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, the paper makes a commendable attempt to advance the efficiency of multimodal transformers on edge devices while addressing some critical limitations found in conventional methods. However, more comprehensive evaluations could enhance the trust in its practical applications and scalability. Given the contributions made and potential influence on the field, I would assign the paper a score of: **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06379v1)
- **Authors**: Filip Ekström Kelvinius, Zheng Zhao, Fredrik Lindsten
- **Abstract**: A recent line of research has exploited pre-trained generative diffusion models as priors for solving Bayesian inverse problems. We contribute to this research direction by designing a sequential Monte Carlo method for linear-Gaussian inverse problems which builds on ``decoupled diffusion", where the generative process is designed such that larger updates to the sample are possible. The method is asymptotically exact and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) algorithm on both synthetic data and image reconstruction tasks. Further, we demonstrate how the approach can be extended to discrete data.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to solving linear-Gaussian Bayesian inverse problems using a Decoupled Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo (DDSMC) method. This approach leverages pre-trained generative diffusion models, allowing for more significant updates to samples during the Monte Carlo process. The authors claim the method is asymptotically exact and showcase its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic datasets and image reconstruction tasks. Moreover, they indicate the adaptability of their method for discrete data scenarios. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of Bayesian inference and computational statistics by presenting an innovative algorithm that combines sequential Monte Carlo methods with generative models—specifically, by adapting the notion of decoupled diffusion within this context.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The introduction of DDSMC is innovative as it bridges the gap between generative models and Bayesian inverse problems, a relatively unexplored area. The concept of "decoupling" the diffusion process to allow larger updates is a compelling advancement that could enhance convergence rates in sampling methods.     2. **Asymptotic Exactness:** The claim of asymptotic exactness provides theoretical grounding for the method, making it appealing in terms of reliability and feasibility for practical applications. 3. **Application Demonstrations:** The experimental results on synthetic data and image reconstruction tasks provide a practical validation of the method's effectiveness. This can encourage further research and application in real-world problems. 4. **Extension to Discrete Data:** The capability to extend the DDSMC method to discrete data adds to its versatility and potential broader applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the experiments are impressive, they may not adequately cover the wide range of complexities present in real-world inverse problems. Additionally, the paper could benefit from more extensive comparisons with existing methods to quantify improvements. 2. **Theoretical Context:** Although the algorithm is claimed to be asymptotically exact, a detailed discussion on the conditions necessary for this to hold true could enhance the rigor of the theoretical contributions. 3. **Generative Model Dependence:** The reliance on pre-trained generative models might restrict the method’s applicability to scenarios where such models are available, limiting its generalizability. **Potential Influence on the Field:** The work could significantly influence the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning, particularly in applications requiring efficient sampling methods. The introduction of DDSMC may provide a new direction for future research, encouraging the integration of advanced generative modeling techniques with traditional Bayesian inference frameworks. **Score: 8** This score reflects a high degree of novelty and practical applicability, combined with some limitations in experiment scope and theoretical detail. The work appears to be a solid advancement in its field, though room for refinement and broader testing remains.

### How Humans Help LLMs: Assessing and Incentivizing Human Preference Annotators
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06387v1)
- **Authors**: Shang Liu, Hanzhao Wang, Zhongyao Ma, Xiaocheng Li
- **Abstract**: Human-annotated preference data play an important role in aligning large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we investigate the questions of assessing the performance of human annotators and incentivizing them to provide high-quality annotations. The quality assessment of language/text annotation faces two challenges: (i) the intrinsic heterogeneity among annotators, which prevents the classic methods that assume the underlying existence of a true label; and (ii) the unclear relationship between the annotation quality and the performance of downstream tasks, which excludes the possibility of inferring the annotators' behavior based on the model performance trained from the annotation data. Then we formulate a principal-agent model to characterize the behaviors of and the interactions between the company and the human annotators. The model rationalizes a practical mechanism of a bonus scheme to incentivize annotators which benefits both parties and it underscores the importance of the joint presence of an assessment system and a proper contract scheme. From a technical perspective, our analysis extends the existing literature on the principal-agent model by considering a continuous action space for the agent. We show the gap between the first-best and the second-best solutions (under the continuous action space) is of $\Theta(1/\sqrt{n \log n})$ for the binary contracts and $\Theta(1/n)$ for the linear contracts, where $n$ is the number of samples used for performance assessment; this contrasts with the known result of $\exp(-\Theta(n))$ for the binary contracts when the action space is discrete. Throughout the paper, we use real preference annotation data to accompany our discussions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled **"How Humans Help LLMs: Assessing and Incentivizing Human Preference Annotators"** explores the critical role of human-annotated preference data in aligning large language models (LLMs). The authors address two primary challenges related to the quality of annotations: the variability among annotators, which limits the effectiveness of traditional assessment methods, and the ambiguous connection between annotation quality and downstream task performance. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a principal-agent model that captures the interactions between companies and human annotators, leading to the design of a bonus scheme that motivates annotators to produce high-quality data while benefiting the company. Their analysis highlights the importance of integrating an effective assessment system with a suitable contract to optimize performance. Furthermore, the paper presents a technical innovation by examining a continuous action space for the agent, revealing gaps between first-best and second-best solutions under this framework, which contrasts with previous findings involving discrete action spaces. The research is grounded in real preference annotation data, providing practical relevance to the theoretical insights. ### Critical Evaluation This paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of human-annotated data for machine learning, particularly in the context of alignment in LLMs. Several strengths are notable in the work: 1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The growing importance of LLMs makes the development of reliable human annotation methods critical. The paper tackles relevant questions that are highly pertinent in contemporary AI research.     2. **Innovative Approach**: By formulating a principal-agent model that accounts for continuous action spaces, the authors extend existing theoretical frameworks, providing novel insights that enhance our understanding of annotator behavior. 3. **Practical Implications**: The proposed bonus scheme not only promotes high-quality annotations but also does so in a manner that balances the interests of annotators and the company, hinting at scalable applications in model training. However, there are certain weaknesses that merit discussion: 1. **Complexity of the Model**: While the principal-agent model introduced is an innovative approach, the complexity may hinder its practical implementation in varying contexts within the industry. More guidance on real-world applicability or case studies could significantly enhance its utility. 2. **Assumption Limitations**: The assumptions made regarding action space and contract types may not hold universally across different domain applications, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper lacks a comprehensive exploration of the evaluation metrics used for assessing the quality of annotations and their direct correlation to model performance, which could provide deeper validation of the proposed methods. In conclusion, this paper combines theoretical rigor with practical implications, filling a critical gap in understanding how to evaluate and incentivize human annotators effectively within the context of LLMs. However, due to its complexity and assumption boundaries, there are questions about general applicability and ease of implementation.  **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Pengyu Long, Zijun Zhao, Min Ouyang, Qingcheng Zhao, Qixuan Zhang, Wei Yang, Lan Xu, Jingyi Yu
- **Abstract**: Hairstyles are intricate and culturally significant with various geometries, textures, and structures. Existing text or image-guided generation methods fail to handle the richness and complexity of diverse styles. We present TANGLED, a novel approach for 3D hair strand generation that accommodates diverse image inputs across styles, viewpoints, and quantities of input views. TANGLED employs a three-step pipeline. First, our MultiHair Dataset provides 457 diverse hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes, emphasizing complex and culturally significant styles to improve model generalization. Second, we propose a diffusion framework conditioned on multi-view linearts that can capture topological cues (e.g., strand density and parting lines) while filtering out noise. By leveraging a latent diffusion model with cross-attention on lineart features, our method achieves flexible and robust 3D hair generation across diverse input conditions. Third, a parametric post-processing module enforces braid-specific constraints to maintain coherence in complex structures. This framework not only advances hairstyle realism and diversity but also enables culturally inclusive digital avatars and novel applications like sketch-based 3D strand editing for animation and augmented reality.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "TANGLED: Generating 3D Hair Strands from Images with Arbitrary Styles and Viewpoints" presents a novel approach for creating realistic 3D hair strands that can accommodate a wide variety of styles and viewpoints. The authors introduce TANGLED, a three-step pipeline that includes (1) the development of the MultiHair Dataset, which holds 457 hairstyles annotated with 74 attributes to enhance model training and generalization; (2) a diffusion framework using multi-view linearts to capture essential hair features while minimizing noise; and (3) a post-processing module that applies braid-specific constraints for maintaining structural coherence. The proposed method aims to advance the realism and diversity of 3D hairstyles, promoting culturally inclusive avatars and enabling new applications in animation and augmented reality. **Critical Evaluation:** The significance of TANGLED lies in its comprehensive approach to generating 3D hairstyles, a complex task due to the intricate geometries and textures involved. By focusing on culturally significant styles and diverse input conditions, the paper addresses a gap in existing generation techniques that often struggle with the richness of hair representation. The innovative use of a diffusion framework conditioned on lineart input is noteworthy and contributes to the advancement of 3D generation technology. However, a key area of criticism pertains to the novelty of the dataset itself. While the MultiHair Dataset is an important asset, its contribution largely relies on the existing body of work in hairstyle classification and generation. Additionally, the practical applications of the model in real-world scenarios, particularly in augmented reality and animation, remain to be fully explored and validated, which could limit its immediate impact. Moreover, while the diffusion model promises robust generation, the effectiveness of this framework could vary based on the quality and diversity of the input data, which raises questions about its generalization capabilities across less-represented styles. In conclusion, although TANGLED makes significant strides in the field of 3D hair generation and offers thorough methodologies, some elements may fall short in demonstrating comprehensive novelty. Overall, it provides a valuable contribution toward enhancing digital representation and cultural inclusivity. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative approach to hairstyle generation and the constructive advancements in the methodology, while acknowledging limitations in dataset reliance and the need for further exploration of practical applications.

- **Authors**: Haofei Lu, Yifei Shen, Dongsheng Li, Junliang Xing, Dongqi Han
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have shown great promise in decision-making, also known as diffusion planning. However, the slow inference speeds limit their potential for broader real-world applications. Here, we introduce Habi, a general framework that transforms powerful but slow diffusion planning models into fast decision-making models, which mimics the cognitive process in the brain that costly goal-directed behavior gradually transitions to efficient habitual behavior with repetitive practice. Even using a laptop CPU, the habitized model can achieve an average 800+ Hz decision-making frequency (faster than previous diffusion planners by orders of magnitude) on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks D4RL, while maintaining comparable or even higher performance compared to its corresponding diffusion planner. Our work proposes a fresh perspective of leveraging powerful diffusion models for real-world decision-making tasks. We also provide robust evaluations and analysis, offering insights from both biological and engineering perspectives for efficient and effective decision-making.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Habitizing Diffusion Planning for Efficient and Effective Decision Making" addresses the limitations of diffusion models in decision-making, primarily their slow inference speed, which hampers their practical application. The authors introduce Habi, a framework designed to accelerate diffusion planning models by mimicking the cognitive transition from slow, goal-directed behavior to fast, habitual decision-making through repetitive practice. Their results demonstrate that the habitized model can achieve decision-making frequencies exceeding 800+ Hz, significantly faster than existing diffusion planners, while maintaining or improving performance on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks such as D4RL. The paper also explores the implications of this approach from both biological and engineering viewpoints, offering insights into the dynamics of decision-making processes. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The innovation of Habi in transforming diffusion planning models by integrating concepts from cognitive science represents a compelling advancement in the field of decision-making.  **Strengths:** 1. **Performance Improvement:** The significant increase in decision-making frequency (800+ Hz) showcases the effectiveness of the proposed model, addressing a critical barrier in the application of diffusion models. 2. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** By drawing inspiration from cognitive processes, the authors provide a novel perspective that could lead to further interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience and artificial intelligence. 3. **Robust Evaluation:** The paper includes thorough evaluations and comparisons with existing models, validating claims and ensuring credibility in the proposed framework. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Application:** The paper mainly focuses on offline reinforcement learning benchmarks, which may limit its immediate applicability in more complex, real-world scenarios that require dynamic adaptation. 2. **Potential Over-Simplification:** While the mimicry of habitual behavior is a clever approach, it may oversimplify the complexities involved in real-world decision-making, which often requires nuanced and adaptative strategies. 3. **Lack of Theoretical Grounding:** Although the empirical results are impressive, further grounding in theoretical principles could enhance the framework's foundational understanding and applicability beyond the benchmarks. **Overall Significance:** The work contributes meaningfully to the acceleration of decision-making processes in machine learning, offering a fresh perspective that amalgamates insights from cognitive science with computational methods. However, its broader applicability and theoretical underpinning could be fortified in future research. ### Score Taking into account the aforementioned strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score reflecting the paper's contribution, recognition of its limitations, and its potential influence on the field:  **Score: 8**

### Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06415v1)
- **Authors**: Yongqi An, Xu Zhao, Tao Yu, Ming Tang, Jinqiao Wang
- **Abstract**: Outliers have been widely observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly impacting model performance and posing challenges for model compression. Understanding the functionality and formation mechanisms of these outliers is critically important. Existing works, however, largely focus on reducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an in-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of outliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers-activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers-and analyze their distributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections between their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention mechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the mechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through theoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the self-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit context-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers stem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study not only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows that structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve model compression. The code is avilable at https://github.com/an-yongqi/systematic-outliers.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models" examines the phenomenon of outliers within large language models (LLMs), addressing their impact on performance and the challenges they create for model compression. While previous research has predominantly focused on mitigating the effects of outliers through algorithmic strategies, this work emphasizes a deeper understanding of their causes and operational roles. The authors categorize outliers into three types: activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers, and detail their distribution and relationships within the attention mechanism. They propose that these outliers arise from the softmax operation in the self-attention mechanism and act as implicit context-aware scaling factors. Consequently, they introduce the term "systematic outliers" to describe these phenomena, which originate from systematic influences. The study's findings suggest that eliminating these outliers can enhance convergence rates and improve the effectiveness of model compression. The code accompanying the research is accessible through a specified GitHub link. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:**  This paper offers a fresh perspective by systematically characterizing outliers in LLMs rather than merely addressing their problematic aspects. It frames outliers as entities with functional roles within the model's architecture, which is a novel approach. The introduction of categories for different types of outliers is particularly significant because it provides a structured framework for future research in both understanding and mitigating outliers. Moreover, the idea that these outliers can enhance model performance when managed properly adds an interesting layer to the discourse surrounding LLM optimization. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors present a robust theoretical foundation for their arguments, which is supported by empirical experimentation to demonstrate the effects of systematic outliers. 2. **Insightful Distinction:** By clearly categorizing and analyzing different types of outliers, the paper enriches the existing literature, encouraging more nuanced discussions in the field. 3. **Practical Implications:** The potential for outlier mitigation to accelerate convergence and improve model compression is likely to be of great interest to researchers focused on optimizing LLM implementations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Depth of Analysis:** While the authors provide a theoretical basis and categorization of outliers, the depth of causal analysis could be expanded. Understanding the various influences that create these systematic outliers could yield even more practical insights. 2. **Generality of Findings:** The focus on LLMs, particularly the self-attention mechanism, might limit the applicability of findings to other types of models. Further exploration of whether systematic outliers exist in other neural architectures would enhance the impact of this work. 3. **Computational Resources:** The analysis may require significant computational resources, which could limit reproducibility for smaller research groups or institutions. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the complex role of systematic outliers in LLMs. It opens avenues for further research and offers practical applications for model optimization, making it a meaningful contribution to the field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and theoretical contributions while considering its limitations in depth and generalizability. The findings are likely to inspire further investigations into both the nature of outliers and their implications for model performance, shading a positive light on the paper's potential impact within the research community.

### Robust Watermarks Leak: Channel-Aware Feature Extraction Enables Adversarial Watermark Manipulation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06418v1)
- **Authors**: Zhongjie Ba, Yitao Zhang, Peng Cheng, Bin Gong, Xinyu Zhang, Qinglong Wang, Kui Ren
- **Abstract**: Watermarking plays a key role in the provenance and detection of AI-generated content. While existing methods prioritize robustness against real-world distortions (e.g., JPEG compression and noise addition), we reveal a fundamental tradeoff: such robust watermarks inherently improve the redundancy of detectable patterns encoded into images, creating exploitable information leakage. To leverage this, we propose an attack framework that extracts leakage of watermark patterns through multi-channel feature learning using a pre-trained vision model. Unlike prior works requiring massive data or detector access, our method achieves both forgery and detection evasion with a single watermarked image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 60\% success rate gain in detection evasion and 51\% improvement in forgery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining visual fidelity. Our work exposes the robustness-stealthiness paradox: current "robust" watermarks sacrifice security for distortion resistance, providing insights for future watermark design.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Robust Watermarks Leak: Channel-Aware Feature Extraction Enables Adversarial Watermark Manipulation" discusses the vulnerabilities of current watermarking techniques used in AI-generated content detection. While existing methods focus on robustness to distortions, this paper identifies a critical tradeoff: the robustness of watermarks can lead to enhanced redundancy in the encoded patterns, which can be exploited to leak information. The authors propose a novel attack framework that utilizes multi-channel feature learning with a pre-trained vision model to effectively extract watermark leakage from a singular watermarked image, achieving significant improvements in detection evasion (60% success rate gain) and forgery accuracy (51% improvement) while retaining visual fidelity. The work underscores a paradox in watermark design, revealing that robust watermarks may compromise security, which presents crucial implications for future watermarking strategies. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:**   The paper presents a significant advancement in understanding the security vulnerabilities of watermarking methods in the context of AI-generated content. By highlighting the tradeoff between watermark robustness and security, it provides new insights into the implications of these design choices. The approach of using a pre-trained vision model for extracting watermark leakage is an innovative step forward, diverging from conventional methods that demand extensive datasets or access to detection systems. This novel framework can influence future research directions in watermarking techniques. **Significance:**   The significance of this work lies in its identification of a fundamental flaw in existing watermarking systems. It challenges the prevailing notion that robustness equates to security—an important consideration within the rapidly evolving domain of AI-generated content and its implications for copyright and authenticity. By showcasing that achieving robust watermarks can inadvertently lead to greater exploitability, this paper shifts the focus toward developing more secure and balanced watermarking methods. **Strengths:**   1. **Innovative Framework:** The use of multi-channel feature learning to extract watermark leakage is a valuable methodological contribution that may inspire further research. 2. **Clear Real-World Implications:** The findings have immediate applicability to digital copyright issues, emphasizing the need for better watermark designs in AI contexts. 3. **Impressive Experimental Results:** Achieving notable improvements in evasion and forgery metrics supports the authors' claims and demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed method. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Lack of Comprehensive Countermeasures Discussion:** The paper could benefit from discussing potential defenses against the attack framework it proposes, leaving a gap for future exploration. 2. **Generalization Concerns:** The method's performance across various watermarking techniques or types of distortions remains unspecified, which may limit its robustness in diverse scenarios. In summary, while the paper has distinct strengths and offers a critical perspective on current watermarking techniques, it also has areas that could be enhanced to bolster its impact further. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to understanding the security vulnerabilities of watermarking techniques in the AI context while acknowledging a few limitations related to countermeasures and generalization. It stands as a significant work that could direct future research in watermark design and security.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial advancements in the field of robotic and autonomous driving. This study presents the first Occupancy-based Large Language Model (Occ-LLM), which represents a pioneering effort to integrate LLMs with an important representation. To effectively encode occupancy as input for the LLM and address the category imbalances associated with occupancy, we propose Motion Separation Variational Autoencoder (MS-VAE). This innovative approach utilizes prior knowledge to distinguish dynamic objects from static scenes before inputting them into a tailored Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This separation enhances the model's capacity to concentrate on dynamic trajectories while effectively reconstructing static scenes. The efficacy of Occ-LLM has been validated across key tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, self-ego planning, and occupancy-based scene question answering. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Occ-LLM significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving gains of about 6\% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 4\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for the task of 4D occupancy forecasting. These findings highlight the transformative potential of Occ-LLM in reshaping current paradigms within robotic and autonomous driving.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents Occ-LLM, an innovative Occupancy-based Large Language Model designed to enhance autonomous driving capabilities by integrating occupancy data with LLMs. To address challenges like category imbalances in occupancy representation, the authors introduce the Motion Separation Variational Autoencoder (MS-VAE), which differentiates between dynamic and static elements in a scene before processing. Occ-LLM's effectiveness is demonstrated in tasks such as 4D occupancy forecasting, self-ego planning, and question answering related to occupancy-based scenes. The results show significant performance improvements over existing methods, marked by increases of approximately 6% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 4% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 4D occupancy forecasting, indicating a strong potential for transforming methodologies in robotic and autonomous driving. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its unique integration of LLMs with occupancy representation, which is less explored in current research on autonomous driving. The introduction of MS-VAE presents a compelling approach to distinguishing between dynamic and static elements, which is critical for improving the accuracy of occupancy forecasting. This aspect highlights the authors' understanding of the complexities in autonomous driving environments. However, the evaluation methods used to validate the effectiveness of Occ-LLM could be more comprehensive. While the improvement in IoU metrics is commendable, the paper lacks a detailed comparison of the model’s performance across various conditions or in real-world scenarios, which could provide deeper insights into its robustness. Furthermore, the potential limitations of applying LLMs in real-time driving situations, such as computational overhead and processing speed, are not sufficiently addressed. This could affect the generalizability of the model in practical applications. Overall, the paper represents a significant progression in the intersection of LLMs and autonomous driving, demonstrating an innovative approach that could influence future research and applications. However, the evaluation's lack of depth and the absence of a discussion on real-world applicability slightly diminish its impact. **Score: 7**  **Justification:** The score of 7 reflects the paper's solid contribution to the field, leveraging novel methodologies and showing promising results. However, the need for more comprehensive evaluations and discussions on practical implications holds back a higher score, as they are essential for assessing the broader impact of the research.

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in domains such as finance, healthcare, and interpersonal relationships to provide advice tailored to user traits and contexts. However, this personalization often relies on sensitive data, raising critical privacy concerns and necessitating data minimization. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, specifically zkVM, with LLM-based chatbots. This integration enables privacy-preserving data sharing by verifying user traits without disclosing sensitive information. Our research introduces both an architecture and a prompting strategy for this approach. Through empirical evaluation, we clarify the current constraints and performance limitations of both zkVM and the proposed prompting strategy, thereby demonstrating their practical feasibility in real-world scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper proposes a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology, specifically zkVM, to enable privacy-preserving personalized advice across sensitive domains such as finance, healthcare, and interpersonal relationships. The primary concern addressed is the privacy of user data, which is often compromised during the personalization process. By utilizing zkVM, the framework allows for verification of user traits without revealing sensitive information, thereby minimizing data exposure. The authors provide an architecture and prompting strategy tailored for this integration, assessing their practical feasibility through empirical evaluation, while highlighting limitations and constraints of zkVM and proposed strategies. **Critical Evaluation:** In terms of novelty, the paper presents a significant advancement by addressing the intersection of personal data privacy and LLMs through the application of zero-knowledge proofs. The use of zkVM to validate user data without revealing it introduces a fresh perspective in the realm of personalized advice systems, which is crucial given the increasing attention to privacy issues in AI applications. This novel approach demonstrates the innovative use of existing technologies in a new context. The strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Integration**: The framework effectively marries the capabilities of LLMs with zkVM, identifying a pathway to reduce privacy risks associated with personalized AI interactions. 2. **Focus on Real-World Applications**: By targeting domains where privacy is paramount, the work addresses a pressing need in the application of LLMs. 3. **Empirical Evaluation**: The authors provide an empirical assessment of their proposals, which adds practical value to theoretical claims. However, there are weaknesses: 1. **Technical Constraints**: The paper acknowledges limitations of zkVM and the proposed prompting strategy yet might benefit from more extensive discussion on overcoming these issues. 2. **Limited Scope of Application**: While the framework is promising, its effectiveness in various real-world scenarios remains to be comprehensively validated, potentially making broader implementation challenging. 3. **Generalizability**: The reliance on specific technologies may limit applicability outside the discussed contexts. Overall, while the paper is both innovative and relevant, its impact will largely depend on how well it can be applied beyond the controlled circumstances outlined. The approach is timely and represents a noteworthy contribution to the field of privacy-preserving AI systems. **Score: 8**

### CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06428v1)
- **Authors**: Jian Hu, Zixu Cheng, Chenyang Si, Wei Li, Shaogang Gong
- **Abstract**: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with long videos due to the need for excessive visual tokens. These tokens exceed massively the context length of MLLMs, resulting in filled by redundant task-irrelevant shots. How to select shots is an unsolved critical problem: sparse sampling risks missing key details, while exhaustive sampling overwhelms the model with irrelevant content, leading to video misunderstanding. To solve this problem, we propose Chain-of-Shot prompting (CoS). The key idea is to frame shot selection as test-time visual prompt optimisation, choosing shots adaptive to video understanding semantic task by optimising shots-task alignment. CoS has two key parts: (1) a binary video summary mechanism that performs pseudo temporal grounding, discovering a binary coding to identify task-relevant shots, and (2) a video co-reasoning module that deploys the binary coding to pair (learning to align) task-relevant positive shots with irrelevant negative shots. It embeds the optimised shot selections into the original video, facilitating a focus on relevant context to optimize long video understanding. Experiments across three baselines and five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of CoS. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/CoS.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting for Long Video Understanding" addresses the challenges faced by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in comprehending long videos, primarily due to the overwhelming number of visual tokens that these videos generate. The core issue lies in effectively selecting relevant shots from a video; both sparse and exhaustive sampling methods present significant trade-offs. To mitigate this, the authors propose Chain-of-Shot (CoS) prompting, which optimizes shot selection at test time based on the semantic tasks related to video understanding. The CoS method includes two main components: a binary video summary mechanism for identifying relevant shots and a co-reasoning module that links positive task-relevant shots with irrelevant ones. This approach aims to enhance understanding by focusing the model on contextually pertinent video segments. The experiments conducted demonstrate the method's effectiveness across multiple datasets and baselines, validating the adaptability of the CoS framework. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The significance of the CoS framework lies in its innovative approach to shot selection for long video comprehension, a problem that is increasingly pertinent with the growing prevalence of video content in multi-modal AI tasks. The emphasis on optimizing shot selection specifically for task alignment demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the requirements of MLLMs, which is often oversimplified in existing approaches. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Approach:** The idea of treating shot selection as a form of test-time visual prompt optimization is a compelling and original perspective, suggesting a need for a dynamic and task-sensitive selection methodology. 2. **Technical Depth:** The dual mechanism of binary video summary and co-reasoning adds depth to the proposed method, allowing for a sophisticated interplay between selected shots and their relevance to the task. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide experimental results across various baselines and datasets, building a strong case for the effectiveness of their approach. 4. **Reproducibility:** The availability of the code enhances transparency and encourages further research and development in this area. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of the Approach:** While CoS shows promise in specific contexts, it remains to be seen how well it generalizes across diverse use cases and varying lengths of video inputs. 2. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The paper does not extensively discuss the limitations or potential biases of the selected datasets or baselines, which may affect the understanding of the method's applicability. 3. **Dependency on Model Architecture:** The performance gains rely heavily on existing MLLM architectures; future research may need to explore its applicability across various models. In conclusion, "CoS: Chain-of-Shot Prompting" presents a fresh perspective on long video understanding, providing a viable solution to a complex issue in the realm of multi-modal AI. While it excels in novelty and empirical testing, the need for broader application and subtle limitations in generalizability warrant a carefully considered score. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks, which has triggered the discussion of whether the performance is achieved by true reasoning capability or memorization. To investigate this question, prior work has constructed mathematical benchmarks when questions undergo simple perturbations -- modifications that still preserve the underlying reasoning patterns of the solutions. However, no work has explored hard perturbations, which fundamentally change the nature of the problem so that the original solution steps do not apply. To bridge the gap, we construct MATH-P-Simple and MATH-P-Hard via simple perturbation and hard perturbation, respectively. Each consists of 279 perturbed math problems derived from level-5 (hardest) problems in the MATH dataset (Hendrycksmath et. al., 2021). We observe significant performance drops on MATH-P-Hard across various models, including o1-mini (-16.49%) and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking (-12.9%). We also raise concerns about a novel form of memorization where models blindly apply learned problem-solving skills without assessing their applicability to modified contexts. This issue is amplified when using original problems for in-context learning. We call for research efforts to address this challenge, which is critical for developing more robust and reliable reasoning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "MATH-Perturb: Benchmarking LLMs' Math Reasoning Abilities against Hard Perturbations" investigates the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) in light of perturbations to standard problems. It builds upon previous work that explored simple perturbations and introduces two specific benchmarks: MATH-P-Simple (based on simple perturbations) and MATH-P-Hard (involving hard perturbations that alter the fundamental nature of problems). Both benchmarks include 279 challenging perturbed math problems derived from the MATH dataset. The authors observe a significant drop in performance among various models when faced with MATH-P-Hard, indicative of a potential reliance on memorization techniques rather than genuine mathematical reasoning. They point to concerns about models applying learned problem-solving skills inappropriately and call for more research focused on enhancing the robustness and applicability of reasoning models. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its introduction of hard perturbations as a means to evaluate LLMs beyond traditional tests of performance, which predominantly focus on memorization or simple inference. By systematically addressing a gap in existing methodologies—where the response mechanisms of LLMs to complex problem modifications were largely unexplored—this work offers a fresh perspective on the genuine reasoning capabilities of these models. One major strength of the paper is its empirical approach, providing clear data on how various models perform under different types of challenge, which is critical for assessing their true reasoning capabilities. The valid concern raised about a new form of memorization could prompt researchers to refine the design of benchmarks, fostering the development of more sophisticated and capably reasoning AI systems. However, while the analysis of results offers significant insights, the interpretation could be further strengthened by cross-comparison with other reasoning models, or investigation into why certain models, like o1-mini and gemini-2.0-flash-thinking, show specific patterns of decline. Moreover, the implications of the findings could be articulated more deeply in terms of future AI applications, as well as the broader philosophical implications of AI reasoning capabilities. Given these considerations, the paper represents an essential contribution to the field by shifting the focus towards understanding whether LLMs can adapt their reasoning to unfamiliar contexts. Nevertheless, it falls short of revolutionary change, as it builds on existing concerns regarding model performance.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects its significant contributions while recognizing that further depth in analysis and application could enhance its impact.

- **Authors**: Hieu Minh "Jord" Nguyen
- **Abstract**: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to attribute mental states to others and predict their behaviour, is fundamental to social intelligence. In this paper, we survey studies evaluating behavioural and representational ToM in Large Language Models (LLMs), identify important safety risks from advanced LLM ToM capabilities, and suggest several research directions for effective evaluation and mitigation of these risks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "A Survey of Theory of Mind in Large Language Models: Evaluations, Representations, and Safety Risks" explores the concept of Theory of Mind (ToM) in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). It reviews existing studies that assess both the behavioral and representational aspects of ToM in LLMs, shedding light on the models' ability to understand and predict mental states and behaviors of others. The authors also highlight significant safety risks associated with the advanced ToM capabilities of these models, proposing several avenues for research aimed at evaluating and mitigating these risks effectively. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a critical area in the intersection of artificial intelligence and social cognition, namely the ability of LLMs to exhibit ToM characteristics. This is particularly relevant as AI systems are increasingly integrated into social contexts, where understanding human mental states can profoundly affect interactions. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The investigation into ToM capabilities of LLMs is timely, given the prominence of AI technology in everyday life and its implications for social and ethical considerations. 2. **Comprehensive Survey:** The paper compiles existing research on ToM in LLMs, making it a valuable resource for understanding current advancements and limitations. 3. **Focus on Safety Risks:** The discussion of safety risks associated with LLMs possessing advanced ToM insights is crucial for responsible AI development, highlighting an area often overlooked in technical evaluations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Data:** While it reviews existing literature, the paper may benefit from empirical case studies or novel experimental data to substantiate claims made about ToM capabilities. 2. **Generalizability:** The treatment of safety risks could be more robust, with a detailed analysis of specific consequences or real-world implications of these risks, beyond theoretical discussions. 3. **Scope of Research Directions:** The suggested research directions could be expanded upon with specific methodologies or frameworks that could address the identified safety issues effectively. Overall, while the paper provides a valuable overview and raises essential questions and considerations about ToM in LLMs, it does not deeply engage with empirical evidence or the nuances of the challenges it outlines. Therefore, while the paper is significant in addressing an important area, its limited empirical grounding and depth of analysis reduce its overall impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's important contribution to the conversation around LLMs and ToM, while recognizing the need for further empirical exploration and deeper treatment of suggested research directions.

- **Authors**: Yuxing Lu, Jinzhuo Wang
- **Abstract**: Maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) is critical for modern AI systems, but manual curation struggles to scale with the rapid growth of scientific literature. This paper presents KARMA, a novel framework employing multi-agent large language models (LLMs) to automate KG enrichment through structured analysis of unstructured text. Our approach employs nine collaborative agents, spanning entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution that iteratively parse documents, verify extracted knowledge, and integrate it into existing graph structures while adhering to domain-specific schema. Experiments on 1,200 PubMed articles from three different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of KARMA in knowledge graph enrichment, with the identification of up to 38,230 new entities while achieving 83.1\% LLM-verified correctness and reducing conflict edges by 18.6\% through multi-layer assessments.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces KARMA, a framework designed to enhance knowledge graph (KG) enrichment through automated processes using multi-agent large language models (LLMs). Given the challenges of manual curation amidst the explosive growth of scientific literature, KARMA employs nine specialized agents that work collaboratively to perform key tasks such as entity discovery, relation extraction, schema alignment, and conflict resolution. The agents process unstructured text by iteratively parsing documents, verifying the extracted information, and integrating it into pre-existing graph structures while conforming to specific domain schemas. The efficacy of KARMA was tested on 1,200 PubMed articles from diverse domains, resulting in the identification of 38,230 new entities, with a verified correctness rate of 83.1% and an 18.6% reduction in conflict edges through rigorous multi-layered assessments. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: KARMA presents a significant advancement in the field of automated knowledge graph enrichment. Its innovative use of multi-agent LLMs distinguishes it from existing approaches that tend to rely heavily on solitary models or manual intervention. By automating the processes fundamentally tied to KG maintenance, KARMA addresses the scalability issue that plagues the field, especially with the massive uptick in available scientific literature.  **Strengths:** 1. **Multi-Agent Design:** The collaborative nature of nine agents allows for more nuanced handling of diverse tasks, which reflects a sophisticated understanding of the challenges involved in KG enrichment. 2. **Performance Metrics:** The reported metrics, such as the identification of a large number of new entities and a notable correctness rate, provide compelling evidence of the framework's operational viability and efficiency. 3. **Domain Applicability:** Testing across three different domains highlights the versatility and robust application of KARMA, enhancing its generalizability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the multi-agent system is a strength, it also introduces complexity that might hinder adoption by organizations lacking the expertise to manage such systems. 2. **Dependence on LLM Quality:** The effectiveness of the framework is contingent on the performance of the underlying LLMs, which may vary based on the domain and the nature of the text being analyzed. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** The paper would benefit from a more extensive comparative analysis with existing KG enrichment methodologies to highlight its advantages and limitations more clearly. **Impact on the Field:** KARMA represents a potentially transformative approach to managing knowledge graphs in AI applications, particularly in fields where rapid data accumulation is the norm. If adopted widely, it could lead to a paradigm shift in how KGs are curated, making them more robust and up to date. Based on these considerations, I assign the paper a score of **8**. This reflects its notable contributions in addressing scalability through an innovative framework, while acknowledging the challenges posed by complexity and reliance on LLM quality. Overall, KARMA stands out as a strong candidate for advancing the automation of knowledge graph enrichment, with the potential for significant impact if further refined and compared against existing solutions.  **Score: 8**

### UniMoD: Efficient Unified Multimodal Transformers with Mixture-of-Depths
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06474v1)
- **Authors**: Weijia Mao, Zhenheng Yang, Mike Zheng Shou
- **Abstract**: Unified multimodal transformers, which handle both generation and understanding tasks within a shared parameter space, have received increasing attention in recent research. Although various unified transformers have been proposed, training these models is costly due to redundant tokens and heavy attention computation. In the past, studies on large language models have demonstrated that token pruning methods, such as Mixture of Depths (MoD), can significantly improve computational efficiency. MoD employs a router to select the most important ones for processing within a transformer layer. However, directly applying MoD-based token pruning to unified transformers will result in suboptimal performance because different tasks exhibit varying levels of token redundancy. In our work, we analyze the unified transformers by (1) examining attention weight patterns, (2) evaluating the layer importance and token redundancy, and (3) analyzing task interactions. Our findings reveal that token redundancy is primarily influenced by different tasks and layers. Building on these findings, we introduce UniMoD, a task-aware token pruning method that employs a separate router for each task to determine which tokens should be pruned. We apply our method to Show-o and Emu3, reducing training FLOPs by approximately 15% in Show-o and 40% in Emu3, while maintaining or improving performance on several benchmarks. Code will be released at https://github.com/showlab/UniMoD.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces UniMoD, a novel task-aware token pruning method designed specifically for unified multimodal transformers, which address both generation and understanding tasks within a shared framework. Traditional unified transformers face inefficiencies during training due to extraneous tokens and intensive attention computations. While previous research leveraging Mixture of Depths (MoD) has shown promise in enhancing the computational efficiency of large language models through effective token pruning, direct application to unified transformers has proven inadequate due to the diverse token redundancy across different tasks. This study dissects the operational mechanisms of these unified models by analyzing attention patterns, layer significance, and task interactions, revealing that token redundancy is task- and layer-dependent. As a solution, UniMoD employs dedicated routers for each task, optimizing the selection process for token pruning. The implementation of UniMoD results in a significant decrease in training floating-point operations (FLOPs)—around 15% for Show-o and 40% for Emu3—while preserving or enhancing performance across various benchmarks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** UniMoD's introduction of task-aware token pruning effectively addresses a crucial limitation in existing unified multimodal transformers, adding a new dimension to token efficiency and model adaptability based on task requirements. 2. **Strong Empirical Results:** The reduction in training FLOPs by significant margins (15% and 40%) suggests that UniMoD is both practical and beneficial for large-scale applications, likely appealing to both researchers and practitioners. 3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The paper rigorously examines various factors contributing to token redundancy, providing a solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method which enhances its credibility. 4. **Open Science Commitment:** The authors' intent to release code fosters transparency and encourages community engagement, promoting further research based on their work. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Application Scope:** While the method shows significant improvements in the tested models, the extent of its generalizability to other unified transformers remains unclear. The specific improvements could be dataset- or architecture-dependent. 2. **Limited Context on Performance Maintenance:** Although some benchmarks showed performance maintenance or improvements, the paper does not extensively investigate specific cases where performance may degrade, or under what conditions UniMoD could be less effective. 3. **Complexity of Implementation:** The introduction of separate routers for each task might lead to increased model complexity and potential issues with scaling or integration into existing systems. ### Conclusion: Overall, UniMoD presents a meaningful advancement in the field of multimodal transformers, underscoring the importance of task-awareness in optimizing model performance and efficiency. It effectively addresses a notable gap in existing research and offers promising empirical results supporting its application. However, the need for broader validation across diverse tasks and models remains. Therefore, the novelty and significance of this paper merit a high score, but one that acknowledges the challenges of generalizability and complexity. **Score: 8**

### WyckoffDiff - A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06485v1)
- **Authors**: Filip Ekström Kelvinius, Oskar B. Andersson, Abhijith S. Parackal, Dong Qian, Rickard Armiento, Fredrik Lindsten
- **Abstract**: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents WyckoffDiff, a generative diffusion model designed specifically for generating crystal structures that respect the inherent symmetries of crystalline materials. Traditional generative models often overlook symmetry, treating atoms independently without constraining their arrangements or types. WyckoffDiff addresses this gap by employing a crystal structure representation that encodes symmetry characteristics, coupled with a custom neural network architecture that facilitates the application of this representation within a discrete generative framework. The model's discrete nature ensures rapid generation of crystal structures. The authors introduce a new evaluation metric, the Fréchet Wrenformer Distance, which assesses the quality of generated crystals, particularly focusing on their symmetry properties. The authors benchmark WyckoffDiff against existing generative models, highlighting its advantages. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: WyckoffDiff is a significant advancement in the field of materials science, particularly in the computational generation of crystal structures. The explicit incorporation of symmetry into the generative process represents a substantial departure from conventional models. Traditional approaches have largely ignored the symmetric constraints inherent in crystalline materials, which can lead to unrealistic or non-physical structures. By addressing this oversight, WyckoffDiff appears to fulfill a crucial need within the domain, marking a novel contribution. **Significance**: The potential impact of this work is notable. By generating structures that adhere to the symmetry constraints of crystallography, WyckoffDiff can facilitate more accurate modeling and simulation of materials, crucial for industries such as semiconductor manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and materials engineering. Furthermore, the introduction of a metric that quantifies symmetry in generated structures can propel future research in this area, providing a standard for evaluating generative models. **Strengths**: - The approach directly addresses a critical gap in existing generative models regarding crystal symmetry. - The design of a dedicated neural network architecture for this purpose showcases innovative thinking. - The proposed metric not only supports the evaluation of the generated output but also enhances systematic comparisons across different models. **Weaknesses**: - While the paper benchmarks WyckoffDiff against existing methods, it would be beneficial to include more extensive comparisons to assess robustness across diverse crystal systems and to explore its limitations in complexity and scalability. - The implementation details regarding the neural network architecture may not be sufficiently detailed for reproducibility, which is essential for any rigorous scientific contribution. **Conclusion**: WyckoffDiff demonstrates a targeted effort to advance computational generative methods for crystalline structures by incorporating essential physical principles such as symmetry. Although offers significant novelty and potential influence in the field, comprehensive validation and elucidation of its system limitations should be addressed in future work. **Score**: 8

### Adaptive Prompting: Ad-hoc Prompt Composition for Social Bias Detection
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06487v1)
- **Authors**: Maximilian Spliethöver, Tim Knebler, Fabian Fumagalli, Maximilian Muschalik, Barbara Hammer, Eyke Hüllermeier, Henning Wachsmuth
- **Abstract**: Recent advances on instruction fine-tuning have led to the development of various prompting techniques for large language models, such as explicit reasoning steps. However, the success of techniques depends on various parameters, such as the task, language model, and context provided. Finding an effective prompt is, therefore, often a trial-and-error process. Most existing approaches to automatic prompting aim to optimize individual techniques instead of compositions of techniques and their dependence on the input. To fill this gap, we propose an adaptive prompting approach that predicts the optimal prompt composition ad-hoc for a given input. We apply our approach to social bias detection, a highly context-dependent task that requires semantic understanding. We evaluate it with three large language models on three datasets, comparing compositions to individual techniques and other baselines. The results underline the importance of finding an effective prompt composition. Our approach robustly ensures high detection performance, and is best in several settings. Moreover, first experiments on other tasks support its generalizability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents an adaptive prompting technique tailored for social bias detection tasks involving large language models. Traditional approaches to prompting often involve trial-and-error to find effective strategies, but the authors argue that existing methods largely focus on optimizing individual prompting techniques rather than evaluating compositions of techniques based on specific context and input. Their proposed method predicts optimal prompt compositions dynamically, and they apply this to social bias detection, which is highly context-sensitive. The authors conduct evaluations using three large language models against three different datasets, demonstrating that finding effective prompt compositions significantly improves detection performance. Their approach not only outperforms individual techniques and existing baselines in many scenarios but also shows promise in being applicable to other tasks beyond social bias detection. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The concept of adaptive prompting, which emphasizes the dynamic composition of prompts based on context, offers a fresh perspective on prompting strategies for large language models. This contrasts with existing techniques predominantly focused on isolated prompt forms.     2. **Contextual Relevance**: The paper directly targets the pressing issue of social bias, a critical challenge in natural language processing. The focus on context-dependent tasks reflects a significant step toward improving practical applications of language models. 3. **Evaluation and Robustness**: The robust evaluation against multiple datasets and models provides a strong foundation for the findings, contributing to the reliability of the proposed method.  **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the preliminary experiments on other tasks suggest that the approach might generalize, these findings are not thoroughly validated in the paper. Without extensive testing across additional domains, the broader applicability remains unclear. 2. **Complexity and Usability**: The concept of adaptive prompting may introduce complexity in prompt engineering processes, potentially limiting adoption unless user-friendly tools or guidelines are developed alongside the technique. 3. **Comparative Baselines**: More thorough comparisons against state-of-the-art methods in both prompting and bias detection rise can strengthen the argument for adaptability's importance. The paper would benefit from including a wider variety of baselines to evaluate the method's relative effectiveness comprehensively. **Conclusion**: The approach presented is novel and addresses a meaningful challenge in the field of NLP. Its contributions could influence future research on prompting mechanisms and bias detection. However, concerns regarding generalizability and practical usability warrant a cautious appraisal. Overall, the paper advances the field while leaving areas for future exploration. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.

- **Abstract**: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) succeed in human-guided conversations such as instruction following and question answering, the potential of LLM-guided conversations-where LLMs direct the discourse and steer the conversation's objectives-remains under-explored. In this study, we first characterize LLM-guided conversation into three fundamental components: (i) Goal Navigation; (ii) Context Management; (iii) Empathetic Engagement, and propose GuideLLM as an installation. We then implement an interviewing environment for the evaluation of LLM-guided conversation. Specifically, various topics are involved in this environment for comprehensive interviewing evaluation, resulting in around 1.4k turns of utterances, 184k tokens, and over 200 events mentioned during the interviewing for each chatbot evaluation. We compare GuideLLM with 6 state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, from the perspective of interviewing quality, and autobiography generation quality. For automatic evaluation, we derive user proxies from multiple autobiographies and employ LLM-as-a-judge to score LLM behaviors. We further conduct a human-involved experiment by employing 45 human participants to chat with GuideLLM and baselines. We then collect human feedback, preferences, and ratings regarding the qualities of conversation and autobiography. Experimental results indicate that GuideLLM significantly outperforms baseline LLMs in automatic evaluation and achieves consistent leading performances in human ratings.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "GuideLLM: Exploring LLM-Guided Conversation with Applications in Autobiography Interviewing" investigates the relatively unexplored domain of LLM-guided conversations, where Language Models (LLMs) take the lead in directing dialogues and establishing conversational goals. The authors define three critical components of LLM-guided conversation: Goal Navigation, Context Management, and Empathetic Engagement, presenting GuideLLM as a framework for implementing these ideas. To evaluate its effectiveness, an interview environment was created, encompassing diverse topics, leading to a dataset of approximately 1.4k conversational turns. Comparisons were made between GuideLLM and six other prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama-3-70b-Instruct, focusing on the quality of both the conversational interaction and resulting autobiographies. The study employed automatic scoring through LLM-judged metrics and included human evaluations from 45 participants, who engaged with GuideLLM and other models. Findings revealed that GuideLLM significantly outperformed baseline models in both automatic evaluations and human feedback assessments. **Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Novelty**:     The concept of LLM-guided conversations is an innovative angle in human-computer interaction, as most prior research has centered on user-guided conversations. By shifting focus to a model-directed approach, the paper provides a fresh perspective that could redefine how LLMs are utilized in interactive settings. 2. **Methodology**:     The structured approach to evaluating LLMs through a designed interviewing environment is commendable. By assessing various LLMs within the same framework, the study ensures a level of fairness in comparative analysis. The obtaining of qualitative and quantitative data strengthens its findings. 3. **Impact on the Field**:     The significant findings regarding GuideLLM's performance suggest that it can play a pivotal role in applications requiring guided conversational dynamics, such as psychotherapy, coaching, or interactive storytelling. This could have implications for developing more empathetic and context-aware AI systems. 4. **Strengths**:     - Comprehensive evaluation metrics (automatic and human-involved).    - Clear articulation of the framework (Goal Navigation, Context Management, Empathetic Engagement).    - Strong experimental design, with a large dataset facilitating robustness in the evaluations. 5. **Weaknesses**:    - The paper may benefit from further exploration of the limitations of GuideLLM compared to user-driven models.     - Scalability and generalizability of results beyond the interview context remain to be discussed potentially.    - While the findings are promising, the paper lacks extensive theoretical grounding on how LLM-guided paradigms could evolve into practical applications. Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in understanding LLM-guided interactions, yet it could delve deeper into theoretical implications and limitations. This balance of innovation and ethical considerations will be crucial for its future impact. **Score: 8**  This score is justified as the paper introduces a novel concept with practical implications, evidenced by robust experimental methods and significant results. However, the lack of discussion on broader applicability and comparative limitations tempers the impact slightly.

### Boost-and-Skip: A Simple Guidance-Free Diffusion for Minority Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06516v1)
- **Authors**: Soobin Um, Beomsu Kim, Jong Chul Ye
- **Abstract**: Minority samples are underrepresented instances located in low-density regions of a data manifold, and are valuable in many generative AI applications, such as data augmentation, creative content generation, etc. Unfortunately, existing diffusion-based minority generators often rely on computationally expensive guidance dedicated for minority generation. To address this, here we present a simple yet powerful guidance-free approach called Boost-and-Skip for generating minority samples using diffusion models. The key advantage of our framework requires only two minimal changes to standard generative processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. We highlight that these seemingly-trivial modifications are supported by solid theoretical and empirical evidence, thereby effectively promoting emergence of underrepresented minority features. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip greatly enhances the capability of generating minority samples, even rivaling guidance-based state-of-the-art approaches while requiring significantly fewer computations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Boost-and-Skip: A Simple Guidance-Free Diffusion for Minority Generation" addresses the challenge of generating minority samples in datasets using diffusion models. Minority samples are those underrepresented instances often found in low-density areas of data manifolds, and generating them efficiently is essential for applications like data augmentation and creative content generation. The authors introduce a novel, guidance-free methodology named Boost-and-Skip, which enhances minority generation by implementing two key modifications to standard diffusion processes: (i) variance-boosted initialization and (ii) timestep skipping. These modifications are both theoretically motivated and empirically supported, showing effectiveness in producing minority features without the cost of guidance typically required in existing methods. Overall, the experiments presented demonstrate that Boost-and-Skip can rival and even outperform standard guidance-based methods while being computationally less intensive. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Innovation:** The paper proposes a straightforward but innovative approach to generating minority samples, addressing a significant limitation in existing methods reliant on guidance mechanisms. The idea of variance-boosted initialization and timestep skipping, though simple, is a clever adaptation that shows promise in the realm of generative models. However, the conceptual leap from the existing guidance-based methods to a guidance-free model does lack a comprehensive exploration of alternative past attempts in the literature that similarly aimed to tackle the underrepresentation problem but perhaps did not succeed as effectively.  **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential applications across various domains where data augmentation and creative content generation are needed. The move towards efficiency in generating these samples can lead to broader implementation offerings, especially for resource-constrained environments. However, it remains to be seen how well these results generalize to more complex datasets or real-world scenarios, which might limit its immediate applicability and the robustness of its claims. **Strengths:** - The methodology is introduced clearly with adequate theoretical backing. - The empirical results demonstrate improved performance relative to existing methods. - The approach is resource-efficient, making it accessible for broader user adoption. **Weaknesses:** - The novelty might be seen as incremental since it builds upon existing frameworks without a deeper comparative analysis of previous attempts at guidance-free methods. - Potential limitations and scenarios where the method may struggle are not sufficiently explored, which could pose risks for using the method in critical applications. In summary, while "Boost-and-Skip" presents a valuable addition to the ongoing discourse on generative modeling for underrepresented classes, its contributions offer a blend of modest novelty and considerable practical value.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution with effective results and efficient techniques, balanced against considerations of novelty relative to the broader context of earlier work in minority sample generation.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06527v1)
- **Authors**: D. She, Mushui Liu, Jingxuan Pang, Jin Wang, Zhen Yang, Wanggui He, Guanghao Zhang, Yi Wang, Qihan Huang, Haobin Tang, Yunlong Yu, Siming Fu
- **Abstract**: Customized generation has achieved significant progress in image synthesis, yet personalized video generation remains challenging due to temporal inconsistencies and quality degradation. In this paper, we introduce CustomVideoX, an innovative framework leveraging the video diffusion transformer for personalized video generation from a reference image. CustomVideoX capitalizes on pre-trained video networks by exclusively training the LoRA parameters to extract reference features, ensuring both efficiency and adaptability. To facilitate seamless interaction between the reference image and video content, we propose 3D Reference Attention, which enables direct and simultaneous engagement of reference image features with all video frames across spatial and temporal dimensions. To mitigate the excessive influence of reference image features and textual guidance on generated video content during inference, we implement the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB) strategy, dynamically modulating reference bias over different time steps. Additionally, we introduce the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module, aligning highly activated regions of key entity tokens with reference feature injection by adjusting attention bias. To thoroughly evaluate personalized video generation, we establish a new benchmark, VideoBench, comprising over 50 objects and 100 prompts for extensive assessment. Experimental results show that CustomVideoX significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of video consistency and quality.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents CustomVideoX, a framework designed to enhance personalized video generation from reference images by addressing key limitations such as temporal inconsistencies and quality issues. CustomVideoX utilizes a video diffusion transformer model, focusing on the efficient training of LoRA parameters for extracting relevant reference features. A novel 3D Reference Attention mechanism allows for interactive use of reference features across both spatial and temporal dimensions, improving integration with video frames. To reduce the over-influence of reference inputs, the authors introduce the Time-Aware Reference Attention Bias (TAB), which adjusts how reference features are factored in during video generation over time. Furthermore, the Entity Region-Aware Enhancement (ERAE) module refines attention bias to align active regions of key tokens with reference features. The introduction of a new benchmark, VideoBench, facilitates comprehensive evaluation of the method using diverse objects and prompts, demonstrating that CustomVideoX advances performance in video consistency and quality compared to existing approaches. **Critical Evaluation:** The novel contributions of CustomVideoX lie primarily in its 3D Reference Attention and the combination of LoRA parameter training with the TAB and ERAE modules, which show a proactive approach to addressing challenges in personalized video generation. The use of existing pre-trained networks adds to the framework's appeal in terms of efficiency but raises questions about its adaptability across diverse scenarios—notably, how well it can generalize beyond its training parameters. Strengths of the paper include its methodological innovation and the establishment of the VideoBench benchmark, which may prove valuable for future research in this area. The emphasis on dynamically modulating reference influence in video content generation is particularly noteworthy, indicating a thoughtful approach to balancing textual and visual inputs. However, the paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion on potential limitations, including how the model performs with highly dynamic or complex scenes, or how it may handle inconsistencies in the reference images. Furthermore, clear comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods would provide stronger context for evaluating the improvements claimed by the authors. In summary, CustomVideoX presents a significant step forward in the field of personalized video generation, notably through its innovative attention mechanisms. It addresses long-standing challenges effectively, evidenced by the experimental results, though further validation is necessary to ensure robustness across a wider array of scenarios. **Score: 8**

### Ignore the KL Penalty! Boosting Exploration on Critical Tokens to Enhance RL Fine-Tuning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06533v1)
- **Authors**: Jean Vassoyan, Nathanaël Beau, Roman Plaud
- **Abstract**: The ability to achieve long-term goals is a key challenge in the current development of large language models (LLMs). To address this, pre-trained LLMs can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning (RL) to explore solutions that optimize a given goal. However, exploration with LLMs is difficult, as a balance has to be struck between discovering new solutions and staying close enough to the pre-trained model, so as not to degrade basic capabilities. This is typically controlled with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty. In this paper, we investigate the exploration dynamics of a small language model on a simple arithmetic task. We show how varying degrees of pre-training influence exploration and demonstrate the importance of "critical tokens" which have a dramatic impact on the final outcome. Consequently, we introduce a simple modification to the KL penalty that favors exploration on critical tokens, increasing the efficiency of the RL fine-tuning stage.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper titled "Ignore the KL Penalty! Boosting Exploration on Critical Tokens to Enhance RL Fine-Tuning" addresses the challenge of achieving long-term goals in Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). The authors investigate how to manage exploration during fine-tuning, traditionally controlled by a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty that balances novelty and the retention of pre-trained capabilities. Their research emphasizes the role of "critical tokens" in achieving efficient exploration and demonstrates that adjusting the KL penalty can encourage exploration focused on these tokens, leading to improved performance on specific tasks, such as arithmetic. **Evaluation**: **Novelty**: The paper presents a novel perspective on the exploration-exploitation dilemma in RL fine-tuning, specifically by re-evaluating the KL penalty's role and suggesting a mechanism that targets the exploration of critical tokens. This approach reflects a fresh take on enhancing the efficiency of RL applications in language models, addressing an important aspect that could be overlooked in conventional methodologies. **Significance**: The findings regarding critical tokens could significantly influence how future research and practical applications approach fine-tuning in LLMs. By providing a method to effectively explore vital components of a task, the impact could extend beyond the specific arithmetic task used in their experiments, potentially applicable to a variety of complex LLM tasks. **Strengths**:  - The focus on critical tokens provides a targeted improvement to the RL fine-tuning process, which is a needed enhancement in the current landscape of LLM research. - The experiment's simplicity allows for clear interpretation of results and implications for further research. **Weaknesses**: - The study is limited to a small language model and a specific task, raising concerns about the generalizability of the results to larger models or more complex tasks.  - The paper could benefit from a more extensive empirical evaluation across diverse tasks to strengthen claims about the improvement in exploration efficiency. Overall, while the paper is innovative and provides a new approach to an existing challenge, its broader context and application need to be more thoroughly explored. However, it lays the groundwork for future investigations into RL fine-tuning strategies. **Score: 7**

### Efficient Scientific Full Text Classification: The Case of EICAT Impact Assessments
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06551v1)
- **Authors**: Marc Felix Brinner, Sina Zarrieß
- **Abstract**: This study explores strategies for efficiently classifying scientific full texts using both small, BERT-based models and local large language models like Llama-3.1 8B. We focus on developing methods for selecting subsets of input sentences to reduce input size while simultaneously enhancing classification performance. To this end, we compile a novel dataset consisting of full-text scientific papers from the field of invasion biology, specifically addressing the impacts of invasive species. These papers are aligned with publicly available impact assessments created by researchers for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that various sources like human evidence annotations, LLM-generated annotations or explainability scores can be used to train sentence selection models that improve the performance of both encoder- and decoder-based language models while optimizing efficiency through the reduction in input length, leading to improved results even if compared to models like ModernBERT that are able to handle the complete text as input. Additionally, we find that repeated sampling of shorter inputs proves to be a very effective strategy that, at a slightly increased cost, can further improve classification performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates methods for effectively classifying scientific texts using BERT-based and local large language models, particularly in the context of assessing the impacts of invasive species in biology. The authors present a new dataset compiled from full-text papers aligned with IUCN impact assessments. The study emphasizes the importance of selecting relevant subsets of sentences to reduce input sizes while enhancing classification performance. Through various experiments, the authors demonstrate that employing human annotations, LLM-generated annotations, and explainability scores can significantly improve the performance of language models. They find that reducing the input length while still sampling shorter inputs from the dataset can lead to better classification outcomes compared to models that analyze full texts, like ModernBERT.  **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this research lies in its dual approach that integrates sentence selection strategies with efficient classification methods utilizing both small and large language models. By focusing on the niche area of invasion biology and linking scientific texts to standardized impact assessments, the paper fills an important gap in the field regarding the impact of invasive species, a subject of significant ecological concern. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Dataset Creation**: The development of a novel dataset adds valuable resources to the community, which may foster further research in this area. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The use of both annotations and explainability scores to train models showcases a well-rounded approach to tackling classification challenges. 3. **Practical Relevance**: The research addresses real-world applications, providing methodologies that can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of text classification in ecological research, which is increasingly important in conservation efforts. However, there are some weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the study is robust in its context, the results may not easily generalize to other fields, limiting the broad applicability of the findings. 2. **Implementation Complexity**: Techniques such as repeated sampling may present implementation challenges in practice, potentially deterring adoption outside of well-resourced research environments. 3. **Limited Exploration of Model Variability**: The study primarily focuses on specific models and does not delve deeply into the comparative limitations of different model architectures, which could have enriched the findings. Overall, while the paper presents innovative methodologies and has practical implications, its scope is somewhat limited to a niche area and specific models. Therefore, it may not have an extraordinarily broad influence on the field.  Given the strengths of its contributions and potential applications, while also acknowledging its limitations, I would assign it a score of **7**. **Score: 7**

### Is API Access to LLMs Useful for Generating Private Synthetic Tabular Data?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06555v1)
- **Authors**: Marika Swanberg, Ryan McKenna, Edo Roth, Albert Cheu, Peter Kairouz
- **Abstract**: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data is a versatile tool for enabling the analysis of private data. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have inspired a number of algorithm techniques for improving DP synthetic data generation. One family of approaches uses DP finetuning on the foundation model weights; however, the model weights for state-of-the-art models may not be public. In this work we propose two DP synthetic tabular data algorithms that only require API access to the foundation model. We adapt the Private Evolution algorithm (Lin et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2024) -- which was designed for image and text data -- to the tabular data domain. In our extension of Private Evolution, we define a query workload-based distance measure, which may be of independent interest. We propose a family of algorithms that use one-shot API access to LLMs, rather than adaptive queries to the LLM. Our findings reveal that API-access to powerful LLMs does not always improve the quality of DP synthetic data compared to established baselines that operate without such access. We provide insights into the underlying reasons and propose improvements to LLMs that could make them more effective for this application.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the use of API access to large language models (LLMs) for generating differentially private (DP) synthetic tabular data, an essential tool for analyzing private datasets. The authors introduce two novel algorithms based on the Private Evolution method, which was previously applied to image and text data. They adapt this technique for tabular data and define an innovative query workload-based distance measure. By employing a one-shot API access approach rather than adaptive querying, the authors assess the effectiveness of using powerful LLMs for this task. However, their research finds that access to LLMs does not consistently enhance the quality of DP synthetic data compared to existing methods without such access. The authors also offer insights into why this might be the case and suggest potential improvements for LLMs to better serve this application. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Application**: The paper takes a significant step by adapting a modern technique to a new domain (tabular data), highlighting the versatility of LLMs beyond traditional text and image domains. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The development of a query workload-based distance measure is a substantive contribution that could be of independent relevance in the realm of synthetic data generation. 3. **Practical Implications**: The study raises important questions regarding the practical utility of LLMs through API access, which is increasingly relevant as organizations seek efficient methods for data privacy. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Empirical Findings**: The conclusion that API access does not improve the quality of synthetic data compared to established baselines may limit the perceived utility of LLMs, leading to concerns about practical implementation in real-world scenarios. 2. **Limited Innovations**: While the paper suggests improvements for LLMs, it lacks detailed mechanisms or pathways for these enhancements, leaving the reader wanting more actionable insights. 3. **Scope of Evaluation**: The research primarily evaluates the quality of synthetic data in the specific context provided, which may not encompass broader use cases or varying data types within tabular formats. In summary, the paper presents innovative ideas and a solid foundation for applying LLMs in synthetic data generation with privacy considerations. However, it encounters practical limitations regarding the efficacy of its approach. The insights are valuable, although presented findings may not cause a paradigm shift in the field. **Score: 7**  This score reflects recognition of the paper's novel contribution to the adaptation of algorithms for new applications while also acknowledging limitations in empirical utility and the need for more actionable recommendations.

### Large Language Models Meet Symbolic Provers for Logical Reasoning Evaluation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06563v1)
- **Authors**: Chengwen Qi, Ren Ma, Bowen Li, He Du, Binyuan Hui, Jinwang Wu, Yuanjun Laili, Conghui He
- **Abstract**: First-order logic (FOL) reasoning, which involves sequential deduction, is pivotal for intelligent systems and serves as a valuable task for evaluating reasoning capabilities, particularly in chain-of-thought (CoT) contexts. Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework. Code available at: https://github.com/opendatalab/ProverGen
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Large Language Models Meet Symbolic Provers for Logical Reasoning Evaluation" introduces a novel framework called ProverGen, which aims to enhance the accessibility and evaluation of reasoning capabilities through the generation of first-order logic (FOL) reasoning problems. The authors argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating FOL reasoning are limited due to the reliance on extensive human annotations and handcrafted templates, which hinder complexity and scalability. ProverGen integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic provers, resulting in a new FOL reasoning dataset called ProverQA. This dataset is characterized by diverse, high-quality problems accompanied by clear intermediate reasoning steps, making it unique in the field. The evaluation reveals that leading LLMs find ProverQA challenging, even with chain-of-thought prompting. Further, the authors finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct using training data from their framework, achieving notable improvements on various test sets, signaling the effectiveness of their approach. The code for ProverGen is made openly available for further exploration. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The introduction of ProverGen is a noteworthy attempt to bridge the gap between generative language models and symbolic reasoning frameworks, which is relatively unexplored territory. While there are various approaches to improving LLM capabilities, the combination of generative models with symbolic provers to create a dedicated dataset for FOL reasoning represents a fresh perspective. However, the concept of using symbolic reasoning to evaluate LLMs has been discussed previously, which slightly diminishes the novelty of the approach. **Significance:** The potential significance of this work lies in addressing a critical gap in the evaluation of reasoning capabilities in AI. By focusing on creating a dataset that reflects complex reasoning tasks with accessible intermediary steps, the authors contribute to setting new standards for future benchmarks, which is vital for advancing research in logical reasoning. The demonstrated challenges that LLMs face on ProverQA suggest that current models have limitations that future research should address, fostering further innovation in both model architecture and training methodologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework:** ProverGen introduces a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both LLMs and symbolic provers. 2. **High-Quality Dataset:** ProverQA could serve as an essential resource for evaluating logical reasoning abilities across AI models, encouraging a more rigorous assessment standard. 3. **Open Code Availability:** The provision of code enhances reproducibility and enables other researchers to build on this work easily. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Challenges of Evaluation Metrics:** The paper could benefit from a more nuanced discussion about the metrics used for evaluating reasoning in the presence of varying problem complexities. 2. **Limited Scope of LLM Comparison:** The comparison focuses primarily on a specific finetuned model, and broader evaluations across multiple models could provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLM limitations in this context. 3. **Potential Redundancy:** While the methodology for generating datasets is innovative, there is potential redundancy in the symbolic reasoning community that may exist already—though not specifically coupled with LLMs, this could dilute the perceived innovation of the paper. **Influence on the Field:** This work could significantly influence how logical reasoning is assessed within AI systems, potentially guiding future research initiatives towards developing more capable logical reasoning systems through enhanced datasets. Its implications stretch beyond just evaluation; it could also inform model design choices in how AI frameworks handle logical reasoning tasks. **Score: 7** Given the combination of innovation, the quality of the generated dataset, and the implications of the research, I assign a score of 7. This reflects a solid contribution to the field, although it acknowledges the existing discussions around symbolic reasoning approaches and the need for broader validation across various models. Overall, the paper is a valuable addition to the literature but has room for deeper exploration and impact.

- **Authors**: Zhi Zhou, Kun-Yang Yu, Shi-Yu Tian, Jiang-Xin Shi, Xiao-Wen Yang, Pengxiao Song, Yi-Xuan Jin, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs), both proprietary and open-source, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. However, they face significant limitations in legal reasoning tasks. Proprietary models introduce data privacy risks and high inference costs, while open-source models underperform due to insufficient legal domain training data. To address these limitations, we study data generation for legal reasoning to improve the legal reasoning performance of open-source LLMs with the help of proprietary LLMs. This is challenging due to the lack of legal knowledge in proprietary LLMs and the difficulty in verifying the generated data. We propose KgDG, a knowledge-guided data generation framework for legal reasoning.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in generative models enable highly realistic image manipulations, creating an urgent need for robust forgery detection methods. Current datasets for training and evaluating these methods are limited in scale and diversity. To address this, we propose a methodology for creating high-quality inpainting datasets and apply it to create DiQuID, comprising over 95,000 inpainted images generated from 78,000 original images sourced from MS-COCO, RAISE, and OpenImages. Our methodology consists of three components: (1) Semantically Aligned Object Replacement (SAOR) that identifies suitable objects through instance segmentation and generates contextually appropriate prompts, (2) Multiple Model Image Inpainting (MMII) that employs various state-of-the-art inpainting pipelines primarily based on diffusion models to create diverse manipulations, and (3) Uncertainty-Guided Deceptiveness Assessment (UGDA) that evaluates image realism through comparative analysis with originals. The resulting dataset surpasses existing ones in diversity, aesthetic quality, and technical quality. We provide comprehensive benchmarking results using state-of-the-art forgery detection methods, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating and improving detection algorithms. Through a human study with 42 participants on 1,000 images, we show that while humans struggle with images classified as deceiving by our methodology, models trained on our dataset maintain high performance on these challenging cases. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mever-team/DiQuID.

### Scaling Multi-Document Event Summarization: Evaluating Compression vs. Full-Text Approaches
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06617v1)
- **Authors**: Adithya Pratapa, Teruko Mitamura
- **Abstract**: Automatically summarizing large text collections is a valuable tool for document research, with applications in journalism, academic research, legal work, and many other fields. In this work, we contrast two classes of systems for large-scale multi-document summarization (MDS): compression and full-text. Compression-based methods use a multi-stage pipeline and often lead to lossy summaries. Full-text methods promise a lossless summary by relying on recent advances in long-context reasoning. To understand their utility on large-scale MDS, we evaluated them on three datasets, each containing approximately one hundred documents per summary. Our experiments cover a diverse set of long-context transformers (Llama-3.1, Command-R, Jamba-1.5-Mini) and compression methods (retrieval-augmented, hierarchical, incremental). Overall, we find that full-text and retrieval methods perform the best in most settings. With further analysis into the salient information retention patterns, we show that compression-based methods show strong promise at intermediate stages, even outperforming full-context. However, they suffer information loss due to their multi-stage pipeline and lack of global context. Our results highlight the need to develop hybrid approaches that combine compression and full-text approaches for optimal performance on large-scale multi-document summarization.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Scaling Multi-Document Event Summarization: Evaluating Compression vs. Full-Text Approaches" investigates the effectiveness of two contrasting methodologies for summarizing large collections of documents: compression-based and full-text summarization. The authors evaluated these approaches on datasets containing around one hundred documents each, utilizing various long-context transformers and compression methods. Their findings reveal that full-text and retrieval augmentation methods generally outperform others, although the compression methods demonstrate competitive performance at certain intermediate stages, despite suffering from information loss due to their multi-stage nature. The paper suggests the potential for developing hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both approaches to enhance summarization in large-scale contexts. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper presents a relevant and timely exploration of multi-document summarization (MDS), particularly the comparison between compression-based and full-text summarization approaches. While previous literature has addressed MDS, the specific focus on the trade-offs between these two methodologies and their performance on large-scale datasets, along with the evaluation of various transformer models, adds a fresh perspective to the field. **Significance:** The implications of this research are significant; it highlights the limitations of compression-based approaches, which are traditionally thought to be efficient, and emphasizes the growing advantages of full-text methods in retaining information. By advocating for hybrid methods, the paper opens avenues for future research that could lead to more effective summarization systems, addressing both quality and efficiency in large-scale contexts, which is a critical issue in document-intensive fields such as academia and journalism. **Strengths:**  - The paper's systematic comparison across multiple datasets and methods enhances the robustness of its conclusions. - It addresses a crucial gap in existing MDS methodologies concerning the retention of salient information. - The combination of empirical evaluations with theoretical insights into the performance of different methods enriches the discourse on summarization strategies. **Weaknesses:**  - The paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion of the limitations of the evaluated methods, particularly in real-world applications where computational efficiency and time constraints may significantly affect practicality. - There may also be areas for further exploration regarding user-centered evaluations—assessing how these summaries meet the needs of end-users could provide deeper insights. Given these points of analysis, the paper undeniably adds value to the ongoing research in multi-document summarization as it effectively bridges a foundational gap and suggests further directions for innovation. While it is a strong contribution, it stops short of a groundbreaking shift in methodology or theoretical frameworks. **Score: 8**

### Unleashing the Potential of Pre-Trained Diffusion Models for Generalizable Person Re-Identification
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06619v1)
- **Authors**: Jiachen Li, Xiaojin Gong
- **Abstract**: Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a new method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) aimed at improving domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID). Recognizing the limitations of existing methods that typically utilize discriminative and contrastive learning but suffer from shortcut learning issues, the authors propose a novel approach that combines these frameworks with a pre-trained diffusion model. The key innovation is the incorporation of ID classification probabilities and learnable ID-wise prompts through a conditioning scheme, which infuses ID correlations into the diffusion process. This synergy allows both models to share insights, enhancing the generalization of Re-ID features. The authors substantiate their claims with extensive experimental validation, achieving state-of-the-art results for single and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks, as well as comprehensive ablation studies that confirm the robustness of their methodology. ### Critical Evaluation: This paper occupies a notable space in the growing body of literature on DG Re-ID, a challenging problem that remains relevant due to real-world applications of person recognition. The proposed DCAC method is innovative as it fuses knowledge from both discriminative learning models and diffusion models, representing a multi-faceted approach to improving feature representation in Re-ID tasks. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The integration of a correlation-aware conditioning scheme with pre-trained diffusion models is a significant novel aspect. It expands on traditional methods by tackling the shortcut learning issues commonly found in DG Re-ID approaches. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The authors provide extensive experimental results that demonstrate the efficacy of their method against state-of-the-art benchmarks, lending credibility to their claims. 3. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The thorough ablation studies not only affirm the methodology's robustness but also shed light on the internal dynamics of the model, aiding future research directions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** The added complexity of integrating diffusion models may pose challenges in practical implementation and might require significant computational resources. 2. **Generalizability Outside Context:** While the paper excels in DG Re-ID tasks, the generalizability of such methods to other domains (e.g., different datasets or tasks) might need further exploration and validation. 3. **Comparative Analysis:** While the paper claims state-of-the-art performance, more detailed comparisons with a broader range of existing methods may enhance the reader's understanding of relative strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, while the paper proposes a novel and potentially impactful method that addresses key issues in DG Re-ID, the complexity and reliance on specific models may limit its immediate applicability in various contexts. However, its contributions and the solid empirical foundation provide a step forward in the field. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's strong novelty and contribution to the field, recognizing its potential to influence future research while also acknowledging certain limitations that may affect its practical adoption.

### Combining Large Language Models with Static Analyzers for Code Review Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06633v1)
- **Authors**: Imen Jaoua, Oussama Ben Sghaier, Houari Sahraoui
- **Abstract**: Code review is a crucial but often complex, subjective, and time-consuming activity in software development. Over the past decades, significant efforts have been made to automate this process. Early approaches focused on knowledge-based systems (KBS) that apply rule-based mechanisms to detect code issues, providing precise feedback but struggling with complex, context-dependent cases. More recent work has shifted toward fine-tuning pre-trained language models for code review, enabling broader issue coverage but often at the expense of precision. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of KBS and learning-based systems (LBS) to generate high-quality, comprehensive code reviews. Our method integrates knowledge at three distinct stages of the language model pipeline: during data preparation (Data-Augmented Training, DAT), at inference (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and after inference (Naive Concatenation of Outputs, NCO). We empirically evaluate our combination strategies against standalone KBS and LBS fine-tuned on a real-world dataset. Our results show that these hybrid strategies enhance the relevance, completeness, and overall quality of review comments, effectively bridging the gap between rule-based tools and deep learning models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Combining Large Language Models with Static Analyzers for Code Review Generation" addresses the challenge of automating code reviews, which are critical yet cumbersome tasks in software development. The authors highlight the limitations of traditional knowledge-based systems (KBS), which provide precise feedback through rule-based mechanisms but often falter with complex code issues. Conversely, modern approaches have adopted learning-based systems (LBS), particularly fine-tuned language models, which allow for broader coverage but sacrifice precision. To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce a hybrid method that synergizes KBS and LBS, thus aiming to improve the quality of code review outputs. The proposed approach employs knowledge at three stages of the language model pipeline: during data preparation (Data-Augmented Training, DAT), at inference (Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and after inference (Naive Concatenation of Outputs, NCO). The authors conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations against standalone KBS and LBS using a real-world dataset. The results indicate that their hybrid strategy significantly boosts the relevance, completeness, and quality of review comments, effectively bridging the strengths of traditional rule-based tools and modern deep learning techniques. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Hybrid Approach:** The paper’s contribution lies in its novel hybrid methodology, which integrates the strengths of both KBS and LBS—this is a valuable addition as it addresses a well-known gap in automated code review systems. 2. **Practical Evaluation:** The empirical evaluation using a real-world dataset provides robust validation for the proposed methods, enhancing the credibility and applicability of the findings. 3. **Addressing Key Challenges:** The focus on improving both precision and coverage in code reviews directly addresses significant pain points in software development, making the research relevant to industry needs. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the results are promising, the study primarily focuses on one dataset. Broader evaluation across diverse programming languages and codebases would strengthen the findings and generalizability. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper contrasts its proposed model with KBS and fine-tuned LBS, yet a more detailed analysis of the individual contributions of the three hybrid components (DAT, RAG, NCO) could clarify their unique impacts. 3. **Existing Work Review:** A deeper discussion on how the proposed approach aligns or diverges from existing methods could provide readers with better contextual understanding of its uniqueness. **Overall Impact:** The integration of traditional and modern techniques in code review generation can significantly influence both academic research and practical implementations in software development. As codebases continue to grow in complexity, hybrid automated tools may become essential for enhancing productivity and maintaining software quality. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and its potential impact on the field while acknowledging areas for improvement regarding the depth of evaluation and contextual analysis.

- **Authors**: Stephanie Schoch, Yangfeng Ji
- **Abstract**: Large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities to learn in-context, where exemplar input-output pairings are appended to the prompt for demonstration. However, existing work has demonstrated the ability of models to learn lexical and label biases in-context, which negatively impacts both performance and robustness of models. The impact of other statistical data biases remains under-explored, which this work aims to address. We specifically investigate the impact of length biases on in-context learning. We demonstrate that models do learn length biases in the context window for their predictions, and further empirically analyze the factors that modulate the level of bias exhibited by the model. In addition, we show that learning length information in-context can be used to counter the length bias that has been encoded in models (e.g., via fine-tuning). This reveals the power of in-context learning in debiasing model prediction behaviors without the need for costly parameter updates.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "In-Context Learning (and Unlearning) of Length Biases" investigates the phenomenon of length biases in large language models (LLMs) that utilize in-context learning. While previous research has primarily focused on lexical and label biases, this study shines a light on the underexplored area of length biases that can negatively impact model performance and robustness. The authors demonstrate that LLMs do indeed learn these biases from the input context, and they identify various factors that influence the extent of the biases. Notably, the research unveils the potential of in-context learning not only to recognize these biases but also to counteract them without necessitating parameter modifications through methods like fine-tuning. The findings underscore the adaptability of LLMs and introduce a novel approach for debiasing models, which can have significant implications for the deployment of LLMs across various applications. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents an intriguing exploration of length biases that are often overlooked in the context of in-context learning in large language models. The novelty lies in the focus on an unexplored type of bias and the demonstration that in-context learning can effectively counteract these biases, offering a new perspective on model behavior without the overhead of parameter updates. This approach could be significant for researchers and engineers working in AI, particularly in understanding and mitigating model biases. However, several strengths and weaknesses should be highlighted.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelties Addressed**: The topic is timely and important for the field, given the rising concerns about biases in AI systems. 2. **Methodological Insight**: The paper highlights methodological advances by showing that length biases can be managed through in-context learning, which may facilitate more robust model applications. 3. **Empirical Analysis**: The empirical investigations into factors modulating bias lend credibility to the claims made. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the study addresses length biases, it does not explore other forms of biases, which could enhance the robustness of the findings. 2. **Generalizability**: The extent to which findings about length biases can be generalized to other types of biases or different model architectures is not thoroughly discussed. 3. **Practical Applicability**: While the debiasing via in-context learning is introduced, the practical implications and limitations for real-world applications remain somewhat vague and need further elaboration. Overall, while the contributions are significant, the scope of exploration and generalization of findings to a broader context are limitations that temper the impact of the work. Nonetheless, the paper advances our understanding of bias management in LLMs and introduces a promising approach that might encourage further empirical studies in this domain. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Benchmark contamination has become a significant concern in the LLM evaluation community. Previous Agents-as-an-Evaluator address this issue by involving agents in the generation of questions. Despite their success, the biases in Agents-as-an-Evaluator methods remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical formulation of evaluation bias, providing valuable insights into designing unbiased evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we identify two type of bias in Agents-as-an-Evaluator through carefully designed probing tasks on a minimal Agents-as-an-Evaluator setup. To address these issues, we propose the Unbiased Evaluator, an evaluation protocol that delivers a more comprehensive, unbiased, and interpretable assessment of LLMs.Extensive experiments reveal significant room for improvement in current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Unbiased Evaluator not only offers strong evidence of benchmark contamination but also provides interpretable evaluation results.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Unbiased Evaluation of Large Language Models from a Causal Perspective" addresses the critical issue of benchmark contamination in the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). Previous methods, particularly those that utilize agents to generate evaluation questions (Agents-as-an-Evaluator), have shown success in mitigating this contamination. However, the authors note that the biases inherent in these agents have not been thoroughly examined. The paper introduces a theoretical framework for understanding evaluation bias and highlights two specific types of bias identified through probing tasks on a simplified version of the Agents-as-an-Evaluator framework. To counter these biases, the authors propose a new evaluation protocol called the Unbiased Evaluator, which aims to provide a more reliable, unbiased, and interpretable assessment of LLMs. Their extensive testing uncovers considerable weaknesses in existing LLMs and offers compelling evidence of benchmark contamination, coupled with interpretable evaluation outputs. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper presents several novel contributions. Firstly, it deepens the understanding of evaluation bias in the context of LLM assessment, an area that has received limited attention amidst growing concerns of benchmark contamination. The introduction of a theoretical framework for evaluating this bias is a significant advance. Additionally, the identification of two specific biases in existing evaluation methods adds a critical layer to the ongoing discussion about the reliability of LLM evaluations. The proposal of the Unbiased Evaluator contributes a practical solution to the identified problems. **Significance:** The significance of the findings is substantial, considering the increasing reliance on LLMs across various applications. By highlighting existing evaluations' biases and providing a thorough evaluation protocol, the paper offers a pathway for more accurate assessments of LLMs, directly impacting future research and application in AI and computational linguistics. The clear evidence of benchmark contamination reinforces the need for improved evaluation practices. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The formulation of evaluation bias offers a foundational understanding that can influence future research methodologies. 2. **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments reveal weaknesses in existing models, which can guide future improvements. 3. **Practical Protocol:** The Unbiased Evaluator serves as a viable tool for practitioners, potentially standardizing LLM assessments. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of Findings:** While the paper identifies biases, the scope of the Agents-as-an-Evaluator setup may limit generalizability across various evaluation scenarios. 2. **Experimental Design:** The extent and diversity of the experiments may need further elaboration to substantiate the claims adequately. 3. **Interpretation of Results:** While interpretations are presented, further clarity on implications for model architecture and training could enhance the study's impact. **Influence on the Field:** The paper has the potential to shift the landscape of LLM evaluation practices. By addressing a core concern (evaluation bias), it sets the stage for more nuanced and effective assessment strategies moving forward, ensuring that benchmarks used in performance evaluations genuinely reflect a model's capabilities. **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, blending theoretical insights with practical applications, although some factors regarding generalizability and experimental rigor could be improved for an even greater impact.

- **Abstract**: Modern large language models (LLMs) driven by scaling laws, achieve intelligence emergency in large model sizes. Recently, the increasing concerns about cloud costs, latency, and privacy make it an urgent requirement to develop compact edge language models. Distinguished from direct pretraining that bounded by the scaling law, this work proposes the pruning-aware pretraining, focusing on retaining performance of much larger optimized models. It features following characteristics: 1) Data-scalable: we introduce minimal parameter groups in LLM and continuously optimize structural pruning, extending post-training pruning methods like LLM-Pruner and SparseGPT into the pretraining phase. 2) Architecture-agnostic: the LLM architecture is auto-designed using saliency-driven pruning, which is the first time to exceed SoTA human-designed LLMs in modern pretraining. We reveal that it achieves top-quality edge language models, termed EfficientLLM, by scaling up LLM compression and extending its boundary. EfficientLLM significantly outperforms SoTA baselines with $100M \sim 1B$ parameters, such as MobileLLM, SmolLM, Qwen2.5-0.5B, OLMo-1B, Llama3.2-1B in common sense benchmarks. As the first attempt, EfficientLLM bridges the performance gap between traditional LLM compression and direct pretraining methods, and we will fully open source at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing2/EfficientLLM.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "EfficientLLM: Scalable Pruning-Aware Pretraining for Architecture-Agnostic Edge Language Models" addresses the need for compact language models suitable for edge deployment, considering limitations in cloud costs, latency, and privacy. It introduces a novel approach called pruning-aware pretraining, which retains the performance of larger models while optimizing for smaller architectures. Key features of this approach include: 1. **Data-scalable Construction**: The authors implement minimal parameter groups and continuously optimize structural pruning throughout the pretraining phase, improving upon existing methods like LLM-Pruner and SparseGPT.    2. **Architecture-agnostic Model Design**: Saliency-driven pruning is employed to automatically design LLM architectures, surpassing current state-of-the-art human-designed models during pretraining. The resulting models, termed EfficientLLM, demonstrate superior performance in common benchmarks compared to existing compact models with parameter sizes between 100M to 1B. The authors plan to open-source their methodology and models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The approach of combining pruning-aware pretraining with architecture-agnostic design is relatively innovative, particularly the application of saliency-driven pruning in the auto-design of LLMs. The work seeks to bridge gaps between traditional model compression techniques and direct pretraining, which is a notable advancement. **Significance**:  The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the accessibility and usability of language models in edge scenarios. Given the current emphasis on deploying lightweight models, the ability to maintain performance while reducing size is crucial. **Strengths**: - The introduction of a new pretraining paradigm that considers both structural pruning and the flexibility in architecture showcases a new direction for efficient AI model development. - The comparison with multiple state-of-the-art models on common sense benchmarks highlights the practical applicability and effectiveness of their approach. **Weaknesses**: - While the results are promising, the paper could strengthen its impact by providing more extensive comparisons with a broader array of existing methods or by including additional benchmarks to validate performance. - The practical implications of deploying EfficientLLM, including considerations of resource requirements for training and runtime efficiency, could be more thoroughly explored. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field by introducing a compelling new methodology aimed at optimizing LLMs for edge applications. However, its robustness could benefit from more comprehensive validation and comparative analysis. Considering the novelty, significance, strengths, and weaknesses of the paper, I would assign it a score of **8**. This score acknowledges the originality and practical implications of the research while recognizing the need for further validation and extensive comparative studies. Score: 8

- **Abstract**: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) benchmarks are often based on open-ended or close-ended QA evaluations, avoiding the requirement of human labor. Close-ended measurements evaluate the factuality of responses but lack expressiveness. Open-ended capture the model's capacity to produce discourse responses but are harder to assess for correctness. These two approaches are commonly used, either independently or together, though their relationship remains poorly understood. This work is focused on the healthcare domain, where both factuality and discourse matter greatly. It introduces a comprehensive, multi-axis suite for healthcare LLM evaluation, exploring correlations between open and close benchmarks and metrics. Findings include blind spots and overlaps in current methodologies. As an updated sanity check, we release a new medical benchmark--CareQA--, with both open and closed variants. Finally, we propose a novel metric for open-ended evaluations --Relaxed Perplexity-- to mitigate the identified limitations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the healthcare domain, moving beyond traditional question-answering (QA) metrics. It critiques existing evaluation frameworks, which usually focus either on factual correctness (close-ended) or expressive discourse (open-ended), noting the limitations of both approaches. The authors propose a multi-axis evaluation suite tailored for healthcare LLMs to illuminate the relationship between open and close-ended assessments and highlight existing blind spots and overlaps in methodologies. Moreover, they introduce a new benchmark, CareQA, which consists of both open and closed variants, supplemented by a novel metric termed Relaxed Perplexity aimed at improving the assessment of open-ended responses. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents significant contributions by addressing a clear gap in the evaluation of healthcare LLMs. Although there is existing research in LLM evaluation, the specific focus on healthcare applications and the dual evaluation framework (combining factual correctness with the need for nuanced discourse) is relatively novel. By combining and contrasting open and closed measurement approaches, the authors provide a more comprehensive understanding of how to evaluate LLMs effectively in a critical domain. One of the key strengths is the introduction of CareQA, a new benchmark tailored to the healthcare context, which can serve as a valuable resource for researchers. This demonstrates a proactive approach to advancing evaluation practices, which is crucial given the potential application of LLMs in sensitive areas like healthcare, where understanding context and discourse is essential. The introduction of Relaxed Perplexity is another notable strength. This new metric seeks to reconcile the discrepancies found within open-ended evaluation methods, offering a potential solution to a known challenge in LLM assessment. However, the paper could be critiqued on a few fronts. The extent to which the proposed metrics and benchmarks have been tested in diverse healthcare scenarios is not sufficiently detailed, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, while the findings related to known blind spots and overlaps provide insight, the practical implications of these findings in real-world applications could be better articulated. **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the field with novel insights, but acknowledges areas where further validation and practical application examples could reinforce their significance. The focus on healthcare is particularly timely and relevant, adding to the paper's impact. Overall, it is a commendable step towards more holistic LLM evaluation strategies in critical domains.

### Boosting Self-Efficacy and Performance of Large Language Models via Verbal Efficacy Stimulations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06669v1)
- **Authors**: Rui Chen, Tailai Peng, Xinran Xie, Dekun Lin, Zhe Cui, Zheng Chen
- **Abstract**: Significant improvements have been observed in the zero-shot capabilities of the Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to their high sensitivity to input, research has increasingly focused on enhancing LLMs' performance via direct and simple prompt engineering rather than intricate domain adaptation. Studies suggest that LLMs exhibit emotional intelligence, and both positive and negative emotions can potentially enhance task performances. However, prior interaction prompts have predominantly concentrated on a single stimulus type, neglecting to compare different stimulus effects, examine the influence of varying task difficulties, or explore underlying mechanisms. This paper, inspired by the positive correlation between self-efficacy and task performance within the social cognitive theory, introduces Verbal Efficacy Stimulations (VES). Our VES comprises three types of verbal prompts: encouraging, provocative, and critical, addressing six aspects such as helpfulness and competence. And we further categorize task difficulty, aiming to extensively investigate how distinct VES influence the self-efficacy and task achievements of language models at varied levels of difficulty. The experimental results show that the three types of VES improve the performance of LLMs on most tasks, and the most effective VES varies for different models. In extensive experiments, we have obtained some findings consistent with psychological theories, providing novel insights for future research.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Boosting Self-Efficacy and Performance of Large Language Models via Verbal Efficacy Stimulations" investigates methods to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) through novel interaction prompts termed Verbal Efficacy Stimulations (VES). The authors suggest that existing research has largely overlooked how different emotional and motivational prompts influence the effectiveness of LLMs, instead focusing primarily on a single type of stimulus. By applying the principles of social cognitive theory, the study categorizes these VES into three types: encouraging, provocative, and critical. It examines their effects on LLM self-efficacy and performance across tasks of varying difficulties. The results demonstrate that different VES types enhance LLM performance, with varying efficacy depending on the model and task complexity. This work offers valuable insights and findings that can pave the way for further research into the role of verbal stimuli in machine performance. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:**  The paper presents a compelling idea by integrating psychological concepts, particularly self-efficacy from social cognitive theory, into the realm of AI and LLMs. The introduction of VES as a method to manipulate and assess model performance based on different types of verbal prompts is a novel approach and adds a layer of complexity to the understanding of LLM behavior. Moreover, the systematic investigation of task difficulty and its interaction with verbal prompts provides a strategic framework for future research, enriching the existing landscape of prompt engineering. **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The blending of psychological principles with machine learning is notable and promotes interdisciplinary innovation. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental backing for the proposed VES adds credibility to the findings, making it a solid contribution to the field. 3. **Potential for Broad Applications:** If the insights gained are applicable across various models and tasks, they could significantly influence how we design prompts and interactions with LLMs. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** While the three types of VES are explored, the paper might benefit from a broader set of stimuli or exploring real-world applications where these prompts could be employed. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** While the VES types are categorized, the comparative analysis between them may need more rigorous statistical evaluation to ensure reliability across diverse contexts. 3. **Generalizability Concerns:** The results may not extrapolate well across all LLMs or different tasks, potentially limiting the universality of the findings. **Conclusion:** The research presents worthwhile insights into enhancing LLM performance through motivational interaction methods, with implications for designing future LLM interfaces and training systems. However, the exploratory nature of the study and potential limitations in generalizability call for caution when applying the findings universally. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong but not groundbreaking contribution to the field, highlighting innovative intersections between psychology and AI while acknowledging the need for further validation and exploration.

### Transfer Your Perspective: Controllable 3D Generation from Any Viewpoint in a Driving Scene

- **Authors**: Tai-Yu Pan, Sooyoung Jeon, Mengdi Fan, Jinsu Yoo, Zhenyang Feng, Mark Campbell, Kilian Q. Weinberger, Bharath Hariharan, Wei-Lun Chao
- **Abstract**: Self-driving cars relying solely on ego-centric perception face limitations in sensing, often failing to detect occluded, faraway objects. Collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) seems like a promising direction, but collecting data for development is non-trivial. It requires placing multiple sensor-equipped agents in a real-world driving scene, simultaneously! As such, existing datasets are limited in locations and agents. We introduce a novel surrogate to the rescue, which is to generate realistic perception from different viewpoints in a driving scene, conditioned on a real-world sample - the ego-car's sensory data. This surrogate has huge potential: it could potentially turn any ego-car dataset into a collaborative driving one to scale up the development of CAV. We present the very first solution, using a combination of simulated collaborative data and real ego-car data. Our method, Transfer Your Perspective (TYP), learns a conditioned diffusion model whose output samples are not only realistic but also consistent in both semantics and layouts with the given ego-car data. Empirical results demonstrate TYP's effectiveness in aiding in a CAV setting. In particular, TYP enables us to (pre-)train collaborative perception algorithms like early and late fusion with little or no real-world collaborative data, greatly facilitating downstream CAV applications.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Transfer Your Perspective: Controllable 3D Generation from Any Viewpoint in a Driving Scene" addresses the challenges faced by self-driving cars that rely solely on ego-centric perception, particularly in detecting occluded or distant objects. The authors propose a solution to enhance the training and development of collaborative autonomous driving (CAV) systems by introducing a novel method called Transfer Your Perspective (TYP). This method generates realistic perception data from various viewpoints based on ego-car sensory data, thus enabling the use of existing ego-centric datasets to simulate collaborative scenarios. TYP employs a conditioned diffusion model to produce outputs that maintain semantic and layout consistency with the original data. Empirical results suggest that TYP effectively supports the training of collaborative perception algorithms with minimal reliance on real-world collaborative data, thus facilitating advancements in CAV applications. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a notable advancement in the field of autonomous driving by addressing a critical limitation of ego-centric datasets through the generation of synthetic collaborative data. The novelty lies in the use of conditioned diffusion models to transform existing datasets into more comprehensive collaborative scenarios without requiring extensive new data collection. This approach is significant as it not only opens up new avenues for CAV research but also has the potential to streamline the development process by using data that is already available. However, the paper does have some weaknesses. The empirical validation may need to be more thorough, as the effectiveness of TYP relies heavily on the quality of the ego-centric data and how well the model can generalize across different scenes. Moreover, while the innovation is promising, the long-term impacts on real-world performance of CAV systems remain uncertain as practical implementations and real-world validations are necessary to corroborate the benefits claimed. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative approach to data generation and its implications for improving collaborative perception systems, potentially fostering greater collaboration in autonomous driving. However, the reliance on existing data and the necessity for further validation present constraints that temper the perceived impact. Therefore, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. This score reflects a robust contribution with clear potential implications for advancing collaborative driving systems, balanced by the need for further validation of the proposed method's effectiveness and real-world application.  **Score: 7**

### Can 1B LLM Surpass 405B LLM? Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06703v1)
- **Authors**: Runze Liu, Junqi Gao, Jian Zhao, Kaiyan Zhang, Xiu Li, Biqing Qi, Wanli Ouyang, Bowen Zhou
- **Abstract**: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Can 1B LLM Surpass 405B LLM? Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling" investigates the potential of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) as a means to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing computation during inference. It addresses a gap in existing literature by systematically analyzing how various factors—policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty—impact TTS. The authors explore two main questions: the optimal scaling approach across differing models and problem complexities, and whether increased computation enables smaller models to outperform larger ones. Through experiments conducted on MATH-500 and AIME24 tasks, the study reveals that the effectiveness of TTS strategies is significantly influenced by model choice and task difficulty. Remarkably, findings indicate that smaller models can indeed outperform larger counterparts; for instance, a 1 billion parameter LLM can exceed the performance of a 405 billion parameter LLM on MATH-500. Additional results show even smaller models outperforming larger ones, indicating that tailored TTS strategies can enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The paper offers a fresh perspective on TTS by systematically considering the roles of different models and problem complexities, addressing a notable gap in existing research. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: Robust experimental results provide compelling evidence that smaller models can outperform significantly larger ones under optimized conditions, challenging conventional wisdom that larger models are inherently superior. 3. **Practical Implications**: The findings have practical implications for model selection and deployment in environments where computational resources are limited, making the research relevant to anyone working with LLMs. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the empirical results are promising, they are derived from specific tasks (MATH-500 and AIME24). Further research is needed to test the scalability of these findings across various domains and types of LLM applications. 2. **Measurement of Performance**: The paper may benefit from more detailed analysis on how performance is measured—specifically, clarity on metrics used to compare different LLMs would enhance reproducibility and understanding. 3. **Complexity of Real-World Applications**: The findings present a favorable view of smaller models, but real-world applications may involve additional complexities (e.g., data variability, competing tasks) that are not fully captured in the experiments. **Impact on the Field:** The insights provided by this research could shift paradigms in model development, with implications for efficiency in training and deployment of LLMs. However, the actual impact will demand validation in a broader range of contexts. ### Score: 8 **Rationale for Score:** The paper presents significant novelty and offers valuable insights into the optimization of LLMs through TTS strategies. It challenges established norms regarding model size and performance, which could lead to more efficient use of resources in LLM research and application. While there are limitations in scope and external validity, the empirical contributions and practical implications warrant a high score. Thus, a score of 8 reflects both its strengths and the need for further exploration to confirm broader applicability.

### Dynamic Loss-Based Sample Reweighting for Improved Large Language Model Pretraining
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733v1)
- **Authors**: Daouda Sow, Herbert Woisetschläger, Saikiran Bulusu, Shiqiang Wang, Hans-Arno Jacobsen, Yingbin Liang
- **Abstract**: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally, overlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the training process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on group-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level information and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as training progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the model to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the current training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to systematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or uninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on the convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal characterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We empirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining 7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear regression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can lead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces innovative algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting designed to enhance the pretraining of large language models (LLMs) on robust and diverse datasets. It critiques existing paradigms that treat all training samples equally, arguing that this approach neglects the varying importance of individual samples. By incorporating a loss-based reweighting mechanism that adjusts sample weights in real-time based on their contribution to error, the authors claim to increase both training efficiency and model performance. They also present a theoretical framework addressing the convergence of gradient-based optimization with regards to these reweighting strategies. Empirical results indicate that this method accelerates convergence and leads to improved outcomes on a variety of modeling tasks, including LLMs and smaller-scale problems. **Critical Evaluation:** - **Novelty:** The paper’s primary contribution lies in its dynamic, instance-level reweighting strategy, which improves upon existing static and group-level methodologies. The authors argue persuasively that traditional reweighting approaches do not adapt to the changing importance of samples throughout the training process. Introducing a theoretically grounded approach that enhances optimization convergence specifically through loss-based reweighting provides a fresh perspective on sample utilization in LLM pretraining. - **Significance:** The concept of dynamically adjusting sample weights holds significant implications for training efficiency, particularly as LLMs grow in size and complexity. As these models continue to be pivotal in various applications, advancing their training methodologies is crucial. The empirical validation across diverse datasets and tasks enhances the paper's applicability and relevance. - **Strengths:**   - The methodology is well thought out, addressing a clear gap in existing literature.   - The theoretical contributions provide a rigorous foundation for the proposed strategies and their expected impacts on convergence.   - Empirical results illustrate the practicality of the approach, showcasing notable improvements in performance metrics and convergence speed across multiple scenarios. - **Weaknesses:**   - While the paper demonstrates improved performance, it could benefit from more thorough comparisons with alternative methods beyond traditional reweighting strategies.   - Details regarding computational overhead and scalability of implementing the proposed algorithms could be elaborated further.   - The theoretical implications would be stronger with more extensive formal proofs or a broader scope of analysis to guard against edge cases in specific contexts. Overall, the paper delivers a valuable contribution by addressing a critical limitation in current LLM training techniques while providing robust theoretical backing and practical validation. Its potential to influence future research and methodologies in the LLM domain, particularly for optimization practices, is significant. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to the field through novel methodologies and solid empirical validation, balanced by minor gaps in comprehensive comparative assessments and implementation specifics.

- **Abstract**: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce VersaPRM, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline -- surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents VersaPRM, a multi-domain Process Reward Model (PRM) aimed at improving the performance of large language models (LLMs) in areas beyond mathematical reasoning. The authors identify a significant limitation in existing PRMs, which are primarily trained on mathematical data and consequently underperform in non-mathematical domains. To rectify this, they propose a novel data generation and annotation method to create synthetic reasoning data, which is used to train VersaPRM. The results demonstrate notable improvements across diverse domains, exemplified by a 7.9% performance increase in the Law category compared to other PRMs. The study promotes openness by making all data, code, and models publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to enhance the generalizability of PRMs through the development of synthetic reasoning data tailored for multiple domains. This expansion from a mathematical focus to broader applications could significantly impact the effectiveness of LLMs in various fields. The introduction of VersaPRM fills a gap in the current literature, addressing a critical limitation of previous models that were underperforming outside their trained contexts. Strengths of the paper include its innovative data generation method, empirical results demonstrating clear performance gains, and the commitment to open-sourcing resources, which facilitates future research and development in this area. Furthermore, the use of a robust evaluation technique (weighted majority voting) to validate performance enhancements adds credibility to the findings. However, the paper does have some weaknesses. The generalization of synthetic data can sometimes introduce biases or limitations; the effectiveness of synthetic data in truly diverse real-world applications could be questioned. Additionally, while the paper mentions performance gains, it does not extensively address the potential trade-offs or challenges associated with training on synthetic data versus real-world examples. Overall, the combination of innovative methodology, significant empirical results, and open-source contributions marks this work as a meaningful advancement in the field of LLMs and process reward modeling. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to improving the applicability of PRMs beyond mathematics, though it slightly acknowledges the caveats surrounding synthetic data usage and the need for further exploration of real-world applicability.

- **Abstract**: Purpose: Earth system models (ESMs) integrate the interactions of the atmosphere, ocean, land, ice, and biosphere to estimate the state of regional and global climate under a wide variety of conditions. The ESMs are highly complex, and thus, deep neural network architectures are used to model the complexity and store the down-sampled data. In this paper, we propose the Vision Transformer Sinusoidal Representation Networks (ViSIR) to improve the single image SR (SR) reconstruction task for the ESM data. Methods: ViSIR combines the SR capability of Vision Transformers (ViT) with the high-frequency detail preservation of the Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to address the spectral bias observed in SR tasks. Results: The ViSIR outperforms ViT by 4.1 dB, SIREN by 7.5 dB, and SR-Generative Adversarial (SR-GANs) by 7.1dB PSNR on average for three different measurements. Conclusion: The proposed ViSIR is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed algorithm is outperforming other methods in terms of Mean Square Error(MSE), Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio(PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure(SSIM).
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "ViSIR: Vision Transformer Single Image Reconstruction Method for Earth System Models" presents a new approach utilizing Vision Transformers (ViT) combined with Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN) for enhancing single image super-resolution (SR) tasks in Earth System Models (ESMs). These models are essential in predicting climate patterns, utilizing complex interactions of various components like the atmosphere and oceans. The proposed method, ViSIR, addresses spectral bias in SR tasks, delivering improved performance over existing methods such as ViT, SIREN, and SR-GANs by achieving better Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and other evaluations measures. The results demonstrate ViSIR’s effectiveness in improving image reconstruction quality, making it a valuable tool for analyzing ESM data. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**: The integration of ViT and SIREN to enhance single image reconstruction is a notable advancement in the field of applied deep learning, particularly in computational climate science. Both ViT and SIREN represent significant architectures in their respective domains, and their combination to address specific issues such as spectral bias in imaging makes this work innovative. **Significance**: The implications of this research are substantial for the Earth system modeling community. The enhancement in image reconstruction capabilities directly influences the accuracy of models used for climate predictions and environmental assessments. Improved model performance in terms of MSE, PSNR, and SSIM could lead to more reliable climate interventions and policy-making. **Strengths**: 1. **Methodological Depth**: The paper effectively combines two advanced architectures, providing a strong theoretical foundation for the proposed approach. 2. **Performance Metrics**: The improvement in PSNR by significant margins over existing methods showcases the practical impact of the proposed method. 3. **Applicability**: The direct application to Earth System Models underlines the relevance of the findings in a critical area of research (climate science). **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper presents a thorough comparison with specific architectures, it could benefit from a broader evaluation that includes additional contexts and types of ESM data. 2. **Generalizability**: The performance improvements demonstrated may not extend to all types of ESM data or could vary across different climate scenarios. More detailed discussion or analysis in this area would strengthen claims regarding generalizability. **Potential Impact**: The introduction of ViSIR positions itself well to influence future research in climate modeling and image processing techniques within the domain. If proven effective across more datasets, it could become a standard technique in the field.

### Gradient Multi-Normalization for Stateless and Scalable LLM Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06742v1)
- **Authors**: Meyer Scetbon, Chao Ma, Wenbo Gong, Edward Meeds
- **Abstract**: Training large language models (LLMs) typically relies on adaptive optimizers like Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015) which store additional state information to accelerate convergence but incur significant memory overhead. Recent efforts, such as SWAN (Ma et al., 2024) address this by eliminating the need for optimizer states while achieving performance comparable to Adam via a multi-step preprocessing procedure applied to instantaneous gradients. Motivated by the success of SWAN, we introduce a novel framework for designing stateless optimizers that normalizes stochastic gradients according to multiple norms. To achieve this, we propose a simple alternating scheme to enforce the normalization of gradients w.r.t these norms. We show that our procedure can produce, up to an arbitrary precision, a fixed-point of the problem, and that SWAN is a particular instance of our approach with carefully chosen norms, providing a deeper understanding of its design. However, SWAN's computationally expensive whitening/orthogonalization step limit its practicality for large LMs. Using our principled perspective, we develop of a more efficient, scalable, and practical stateless optimizer. Our algorithm relaxes the properties of SWAN, significantly reducing its computational cost while retaining its memory efficiency, making it applicable to training large-scale models. Experiments on pre-training LLaMA models with up to 1 billion parameters demonstrate a 3X speedup over Adam with significantly reduced memory requirements, outperforming other memory-efficient baselines.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Gradient Multi-Normalization for Stateless and Scalable LLM Training" addresses the challenges of training large language models (LLMs) with standard adaptive optimizers like Adam due to their high memory consumption. It builds upon recent advances such as SWAN, which seeks to improve performance without needing optimizer states while utilizing preprocessing on instantaneous gradients. The authors propose a new framework for stateless optimizers that normalize stochastic gradients using multiple norms. They present an alternating scheme for gradient normalization that leads to a fixed point, showing that SWAN is a specific case of their broader methodology. By relaxing the properties of SWAN, the authors introduce a more efficient and scalable optimizer, achieving significant computational cost reductions without sacrificing memory efficiency. Their experimental results on pre-training LLaMA models demonstrate a threefold speedup over Adam while drastically reducing memory usage, outperforming other similar optimizers. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The introduction of a framework that utilizes multi-norm normalization provides a fresh perspective in the design of stateless optimizers, which is currently a hot research topic due to the increasing model sizes. 2. **Practical Implications**: By addressing the computational inefficiencies of existing methods such as SWAN while maintaining lower memory requirements, the work promises practical benefits for large-scale LLM training. 3. **Experimental Validation**: The experiments conducted on sizable models like LLaMA provide solid empirical support for the proposed method, showcasing clear improvements over established baselines. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Incremental Improvement**: While the method does streamline certain processes, the foundational concepts around normalization and gradient methods are well-trodden territory. The novelty largely stems from integration rather than a groundbreaking new approach. 2. **Complexity Concerns**: Despite the authors’ efforts to simplify the method compared to SWAN, the complexity of understanding and tuning the new framework may still present challenges, which could limit its adoption by the community. 3. **Limited Scope of Results**: It remains uncertain whether the results will hold across a wider range of models beyond those examined, and further validations are required. **Influence on the Field**: Given the necessity of optimizing memory and computational costs in LLM training, this paper has the potential to influence future work, prompting further research into stateless optimizers and their broader application. However, the field remains competitive, and adoption will depend on how well the proposed framework compares against emerging alternatives. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's solid contributions in proposing an effective framework for stateless optimizer design and offering empirical evidence of its benefits. However, it also acknowledges that the improvements may be more incremental rather than revolutionary within the highly active landscape of LLM optimization.

### Rationalization Models for Text-to-SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06759v1)
- **Authors**: Gaetano Rossiello, Nhan Pham, Michael Glass, Junkyu Lee, Shankar Subramanian
- **Abstract**: We introduce a framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to enhance text-to-SQL model fine-tuning. These rationales consist of intermediate SQL statements and explanations, serving as incremental steps toward constructing the final SQL query. The process begins with manually annotating a small set of examples, which are then used to prompt a large language model in an iterative, dynamic few-shot knowledge distillation procedure from a teacher model. A rationalization model is subsequently trained on the validated decomposed queries, enabling extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. To evaluate the approach, we fine-tune small language models with and without these rationales on the BIRD dataset. Results indicate that step-by-step query generation improves execution accuracy, especially for moderately and highly complex queries, while also enhancing explainability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales to improve the fine-tuning of text-to-SQL models. These rationales include intermediate SQL queries and accompanying explanations, which help in incrementally building the final SQL query. The approach starts with a small set of manually annotated examples that guide a large language model in an iterative, dynamic knowledge distillation process. A rationalization model is then developed to train on these decomposed queries, which facilitates the generation of extensive synthetic CoT annotations for text-to-SQL datasets. The evaluation, conducted using the BIRD dataset, demonstrates that incorporating CoT rationales significantly enhances the execution accuracy of generated queries, particularly for more complex SQL queries, while also improving the model's explainability. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a valuable contribution to the text-to-SQL domain by addressing the often complex nature of translating natural language into SQL queries. The introduction of CoT rationales is a significant innovation in enhancing model explainability and accuracy, particularly for complex queries. The methodology of using a teacher-student model approach for knowledge distillation is strategically sound and capitalizes on existing large language models, which helps in overcoming some of the challenges present in traditional text-to-SQL systems. A key strength of the paper is its empirical evaluation, which not only tests the effectiveness of the proposed method but also situates it in the context of well-established datasets. The results indicating improved execution accuracy provide compelling evidence for the efficacy of the approach. However, the paper has notable weaknesses that inhibit its overall impact. The reliance on manually annotated data, while creating a foundation for the CoT rationales, may introduce bias and limit scalability. Additionally, the paper could have better highlighted comparisons with existing methods in terms of both performance and explainability to strengthen claims of superiority. Lastly, the synthetic annotation process, while innovative, raises questions about the quality and generalizability of the generated CoT rationales across different contexts or datasets. Overall, while this work is a meaningful step forward in the text-to-SQL field, particularly through its emphasis on explainability and intermediate reasoning, it could benefit from addressing the limitations regarding annotation dependency and robustness against overfitting in synthetic data generation. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong contribution with solid empirical validation and a novel framework, yet acknowledges the limitations in scalability, potential bias, and the need for a broader comparative analysis against existing methodologies. The work is likely to influence future research directions in the area, particularly in integrating explainability within deep learning models for structured query generation.

### History-Guided Video Diffusion
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06764v1)
- **Authors**: Kiwhan Song, Boyuan Chen, Max Simchowitz, Yilun Du, Russ Tedrake, Vincent Sitzmann
- **Abstract**: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a key technique for improving conditional generation in diffusion models, enabling more accurate control while enhancing sample quality. It is natural to extend this technique to video diffusion, which generates video conditioned on a variable number of context frames, collectively referred to as history. However, we find two key challenges to guiding with variable-length history: architectures that only support fixed-size conditioning, and the empirical observation that CFG-style history dropout performs poorly. To address this, we propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), a video diffusion architecture and theoretically grounded training objective that jointly enable conditioning on a flexible number of history frames. We then introduce History Guidance, a family of guidance methods uniquely enabled by DFoT. We show that its simplest form, vanilla history guidance, already significantly improves video generation quality and temporal consistency. A more advanced method, history guidance across time and frequency further enhances motion dynamics, enables compositional generalization to out-of-distribution history, and can stably roll out extremely long videos. Website: https://boyuan.space/history-guidance
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "History-Guided Video Diffusion" addresses the challenges in applying classifier-free guidance (CFG), a technique used in diffusion models to enhance conditional generation, to video generation scenarios that involve varying lengths of conditioning information derived from previous frames, known as history. The authors identify two primary obstacles: existing architectures that necessitate fixed-size conditioning and the observed ineffectiveness of CFG-style history dropout in this context. To overcome these challenges, they propose the Diffusion Forcing Transformer (DFoT), which allows for flexible conditioning based on an arbitrary number of history frames. The paper introduces "History Guidance", a set of methods designed to leverage the capabilities of DFoT. The simplest method, vanilla history guidance, demonstrates considerable improvements in video quality and temporal coherence. More complex variants, such as history guidance across time and frequency, further enhance dynamic motion representation and extend capabilities for handling long-duration video generation while allowing for compositional generalization with out-of-distribution history.  ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Contribution**: The introduction of DFoT and the concept of History Guidance represents a significant advancement in video diffusion methodologies, particularly with the capacity to condition on variable-length history, which has been a notable limitation in previous research. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of their proposed methods, demonstrating improved sample quality and temporal coherence in generated videos. 3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper roots its architectural design and training objectives in solid theoretical principles, enhancing the reliability of the proposed methods. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Comparison**: While the authors showcase the improvements with their models, the comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods could be more extensive. Highlighting the limitations of existing methods parallel to their improvements would provide deeper context to the significance of their contribution. 2. **Complexity and Scalability**: The practical implications of scaling up DFoT for real-world applications and its computational efficiency are not thoroughly addressed, which could limit wider adoption in demanding video generation scenarios. Overall, the paper's novelty in addressing a specific challenge within video diffusion and the provision of a theoretically and empirically validated solution are commendable. However, the strengths through innovative methodologies are slightly tempered by the lack of deep comparative analysis and practical scalability discussions. ### Final Score: 8 This score reflects the paper's considerable contributions to the field of video generation within the diffusion model landscape, while also highlighting some areas for improvement in terms of depth of analysis and practical applicability. The work significantly pushes the boundaries of how temporal contexts can be utilized in video generation, making it a noteworthy piece in the ongoing research discourse.

- **Authors**: Ryan Synk, Monte Hoover, John Kirchenbauer, Neel Jain, Alex Stein, Manli Shu, Josue Melendez Sanchez, Ramani Duraiswami, Tom Goldstein
- **Abstract**: There is growing demand for performing inference with hundreds of thousands of input tokens on trained transformer models. Inference at this extreme scale demands significant computational resources, hindering the application of transformers at long contexts on commodity (i.e not data center scale) hardware. To address the inference time costs associated with running self-attention based transformer language models on long contexts and enable their adoption on widely available hardware, we propose a tunable mechanism that reduces the cost of the forward pass by attending to only the most relevant tokens at every generation step using a top-k selection mechanism. We showcase the efficiency gains afforded by our method by performing inference on context windows up to 1M tokens using approximately 16GB of GPU RAM. Our experiments reveal that models are capable of handling the sparsity induced by the reduced number of keys and values. By attending to less than 2% of input tokens, we achieve over 95% of model performance on common long context benchmarks (LM-Eval, AlpacaEval, and RULER).
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Exploiting Sparsity for Long Context Inference: Million Token Contexts on Commodity GPUs" addresses the challenges associated with running inference on transformer models that require processing very large input contexts, specifically up to 1 million tokens. The authors introduce a tunable mechanism that utilizes a top-k selection strategy to focus on the most relevant tokens during inference, significantly reducing the computation cost of the self-attention mechanism. Their approach enables efficient use of GPU resources, allowing inference on large contexts with about 16GB of GPU RAM. Experimentation indicates that by only attending to less than 2% of input tokens, the models retain over 95% performance on long context benchmarks such as LM-Eval, AlpacaEval, and RULER. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The paper’s introduction of a top-k selection mechanism for long-context inference offers a fresh perspective on improving the efficiency of transformer models, which have traditionally required high computational resources to process large contexts. 2. **Significant Efficiency Gains:** Demonstrating that substantial computational savings can be achieved without severely sacrificing performance (maintaining over 95% performance with only 2% of tokens attended) presents a practical solution for deploying these models on commodity hardware, thus broadening accessibility. 3. **Real-World Application:** The work targets a pressing challenge in the field, making the findings very relevant for researchers and developers dealing with large language models (LLMs) and practical applications of AI technologies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Novelty in Mechanism:** While the top-k selection mechanism is interesting, similar approaches have been explored in the context of sparsity in neural networks and attention mechanisms. Therefore, the novelty lies more in the application to long contexts rather than the fundamental concept. 2. **Scope of Evaluation:** The experiments are conducted on specific benchmarks, which, while significant, may not encompass the full range of complexities encountered in diverse applications of large language models. Further validation on additional datasets might strengthen claims of generalizability. 3. **Dependency on Hardware Limitations:** The reliance on commodity GPUs means that while accessibility is improved, the method might not scale or perform optimally on more resource-intensive tasks or within high-performance computing environments. **Impact on the Field:** The findings have the potential to influence how researchers approach the scaling of transformer models for practical applications, especially in environments with constrained resources. However, the effectiveness of the proposed method in more complex, real-world scenarios remains to be fully demonstrated. ### Conclusion: Overall, while the paper presents a commendable and innovative solution to a relevant problem, aspects of the novelty could be seen as incremental rather than revolutionary. The practical implications are significant, but rigor in testing and broader applicability will be critical in defining its long-term impact. **Score: 7**

### Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06768v1)
- **Authors**: Jaeyeon Kim, Kulin Shah, Vasilis Kontonis, Sham Kakade, Sitan Chen
- **Abstract**: In recent years, masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising alternative approach for generative modeling over discrete domains. Compared to autoregressive models (ARMs), MDMs trade off complexity at training time with flexibility at inference time. At training time, they must learn to solve an exponentially large number of infilling problems, but at inference time, they can decode tokens in essentially arbitrary order. In this work, we closely examine these two competing effects. On the training front, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that MDMs indeed train on computationally intractable subproblems compared to their autoregressive counterparts. On the inference front, we show that a suitable strategy for adaptively choosing the token decoding order significantly enhances the capabilities of MDMs, allowing them to sidestep hard subproblems. On logic puzzles like Sudoku, we show that adaptive inference can boost solving accuracy in pretrained MDMs from $<7$% to $\approx 90$%, even outperforming ARMs with $7\times$ as many parameters and that were explicitly trained via teacher forcing to learn the right order of decoding.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "Train for the Worst, Plan for the Best: Understanding Token Ordering in Masked Diffusions" explores the capabilities and training complexities of masked diffusion models (MDMs) in generative modeling for discrete domains. MDMs offer advantages over autoregressive models (ARMs) by allowing flexible token decoding at inference but face challenges during training due to the necessity of solving a vast number of infilling problems. The authors present both theoretical and empirical evidence indicating that MDMs tackle significantly harder subproblems compared to ARMs during training. They introduce an effective adaptive strategy for choosing token decoding orders at inference, which demonstrably increases the performance of MDMs on logic puzzles such as Sudoku—showing a notable accuracy improvement from less than 7% to around 90%, surpassing ARMs with significantly larger parameter counts and training via teacher forcing. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper presents a clear advancement in the understanding of MDMs by revealing their training complexities and demonstrating the benefits of adaptive decoding order at inference. This investigation into token ordering is relatively novel, especially as it compares MDMs against ARMs directly and emphasizes practical application through logic puzzles. The study offers new insights into model performance dynamics influenced by training structures and inference strategies, which is essential as we seek to refine generative modeling approaches. #### Strengths: 1. **Theoretical and Empirical Contributions**: The dual approach of both theoretical proofs and empirical validations strengthens the findings, allowing for a well-rounded perspective. 2. **Significant Performance Improvement**: The results shown in performance tests for Sudoku solve a critical gap in existing models, particularly in demonstrating that MDMs can exceed the performance of ARMs despite training challenges. 3. **Applicability**: The implications of adaptive token decoding in MDMs have broad applicability to various discrete generative tasks, enhancing the practical relevance of the research. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the focus on Sudoku is compelling, further exploration across a broader array of tasks and datasets would strengthen the argument for the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The adaptive inference strategy may introduce additional complexity in implementation, which could deter practical usage in some scenarios where computational efficiency is critical. 3. **Connection to Theoretical Frameworks**: The paper could benefit from a more explicit connection between the findings and existing theoretical frameworks surrounding generative models and their training efficiencies. ### Conclusion: Overall, this paper provides significant insights into MDMs and their comparative effectiveness as generative models. The innovative approach to adaptive token ordering represents meaningful progress within the field, although further studies are needed to establish broader applicability and ease of implementation. Therefore, I assign a score of **Score: 8** based on its strong contributions and clear potential influence in advancing research surrounding generative modeling algorithms.

- **Abstract**: Recent advancements have established Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) as a dominant framework in generative modeling. Building on this success, Lumina-Next achieves exceptional performance in the generation of photorealistic images with Next-DiT. However, its potential for video generation remains largely untapped, with significant challenges in modeling the spatiotemporal complexity inherent to video data. To address this, we introduce Lumina-Video, a framework that leverages the strengths of Next-DiT while introducing tailored solutions for video synthesis. Lumina-Video incorporates a Multi-scale Next-DiT architecture, which jointly learns multiple patchifications to enhance both efficiency and flexibility. By incorporating the motion score as an explicit condition, Lumina-Video also enables direct control of generated videos' dynamic degree. Combined with a progressive training scheme with increasingly higher resolution and FPS, and a multi-source training scheme with mixed natural and synthetic data, Lumina-Video achieves remarkable aesthetic quality and motion smoothness at high training and inference efficiency. We additionally propose Lumina-V2A, a video-to-audio model based on Next-DiT, to create synchronized sounds for generated videos. Codes are released at https://www.github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Video.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents Lumina-Video, a novel video generation framework that builds on the established Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) model, specifically utilizing the Next-DiT architecture for enhanced efficiency and flexibility in video synthesis. Lumina-Video addresses challenges related to spatiotemporal complexity by adopting a Multi-scale Next-DiT design, which learns various patchifications. This approach allows the framework to optimize both the generation process and the control over video dynamics through the inclusion of motion scores. The authors also implement a progressive training scheme that enhances resolution and frames per second (FPS) incrementally, alongside a multi-source training strategy using a mix of natural and synthetic data. This results in high-quality, smooth video outputs. Additionally, Lumina-V2A is proposed, extending the framework to generate synchronized audio for the resulting video content. The code for the framework is publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of Lumina-Video lies in its innovative application of the Next-DiT architecture to video generation, alongside its integration of multi-scale learning and explicit motion control, which aims to improve both the quality and efficiency of the video synthesis process. By addressing an underexplored area within the generative modeling landscape—specifically, the synthesis of coherent video content from diffusion models—the paper tackles significant challenges in spatiotemporal representation and dynamic control. One of the strengths of this paper is its clear theoretical contributions and practical advancements in video generation. The proposed framework not only promises aesthetic improvements but also benefits from promising training strategies that could make it more applicable in real-world scenarios. Additionally, introducing Lumina-V2A indicates an awareness of multimedia generation that could broaden the tool's applicability. However, the paper could improve in areas such as a comprehensive evaluation against existing state-of-the-art video generation methods and a clearer articulation of how the proposed methods distinctively overcome limitations of current techniques. While the results are commendable, without robust comparative analysis, it remains difficult to contextualize the level of advancement truly. Overall, considering Lumina-Video's innovative applications, methodological rigor, and the collaborative nature of its contributions to both video and audio generation, I would assign it a score reflecting its strong potential while acknowledging the need for further validation against competitors. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s significant contributions in terms of novelty and influence potential within the field of generative modeling, while also recognizing the need for more thorough comparative analysis and real-world application demonstrations.

### DeepCrossAttention: Supercharging Transformer Residual Connections
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06785v1)
- **Authors**: Mike Heddes, Adel Javanmard, Kyriakos Axiotis, Gang Fu, MohammadHossein Bateni, Vahab Mirrokni
- **Abstract**: Transformer networks have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains, leveraging a variety of architectural innovations, including residual connections. However, traditional residual connections, which simply sum the outputs of previous layers, can dilute crucial information. This work introduces DeepCrossAttention (DCA), an approach that enhances residual learning in transformers. DCA employs learnable, input-dependent weights to dynamically combine layer outputs, enabling the model to selectively focus on the most relevant information in any of the previous layers. Furthermore, DCA incorporates depth-wise cross-attention, allowing for richer interactions between layers at different depths. Our language modeling experiments show that DCA achieves improved perplexity for a given training time. Moreover, DCA obtains the same model quality up to 3x faster while adding a negligible number of parameters. Theoretical analysis confirms that DCA provides an improved trade-off between accuracy and model size when the ratio of collective layer ranks to the ambient dimension falls below a critical threshold.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "DeepCrossAttention: Supercharging Transformer Residual Connections" presents a novel method for enhancing traditional residual connections in transformer networks, which can sometimes dilute essential information during learning. The proposed method, DeepCrossAttention (DCA), uses learnable, input-dependent weights to augment residual learning, allowing the model to selectively prioritize information from previous layers. Additionally, DCA integrates depth-wise cross-attention to facilitate richer interactions across layers of varying depths. Experimental results in language modeling demonstrate that DCA improves perplexity for a given training duration, achieves comparable model performance 3 times faster, and adds a minimal number of parameters. Theoretical analysis indicates that DCA enhances the trade-off between accuracy and model size, particularly when certain dimensional conditions are met. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: DCA's use of input-dependent weights is a novel innovation that improves upon standard residual connections by adding flexibility in how information is aggregated from various layers. 2. **Enhanced Performance**: Empirical results showing improved perplexity and training speed suggest that DCA has practical implications for language modeling tasks, making it a relevant contribution. 3. **Layer Interactions**: The integration of depth-wise cross-attention is an important advancement that could inspire further exploration of inter-layer dynamics in transformers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Limitations**: While the theoretical underpinning of DCA's effectiveness is presented, greater clarity and empirical validation regarding the critical threshold for layer ranks versus ambient dimensions may be necessary to solidify claims. 2. **Generality of Results**: The results, while promising, are largely founded on language modeling tasks. The broader applicability of DCA to other domains within deep learning, such as vision or multimodal systems, remains uncertain. 3. **Parameter Efficiency**: Although DCA reportedly adds a "negligible" number of parameters, more detailed comparisons with existing models regarding parameter count and computational cost could enhance understanding of its efficiency. **Potential Influence**: The introduction of DCA could significantly influence how future transformer architectures are designed, potentially inspiring a wave of research focused on innovative means of inter-layer communication and adaptive residual connections. However, without a wider validation across diverse tasks and clearer theoretical insights, DCA's impact may be limited. **Score**: 7 **Rationale**: The score of 7 reflects a strong contribution to the field with clear innovation and promising empirical results that enhance transformer architectures. The strengths around novel approaches to residual connections and performance improvements are weighed against the insufficient exploration of broader applicability and the need for further theoretical validation. Overall, DCA is a noteworthy advancement, but more evidence is necessary to gauge its full impact on the field of deep learning.
