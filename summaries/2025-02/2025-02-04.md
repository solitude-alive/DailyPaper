- **Abstract**: This paper presents SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces SANA-1.5, a refined linear Diffusion Transformer designed to enhance efficiency in the text-to-image generation domain. It builds on SANA-1.0 with three innovative techniques: (1) a depth-growth paradigm allowing for the expansion of model parameters from 1.6B to 4.8B while minimizing computational costs and employing an 8-bit memory-efficient optimizer; (2) a model depth pruning method that utilizes block importance analysis to compress models with little loss in quality; and (3) an inference-time scaling strategy that adjusts computation based on model capacity, permitting smaller models to yield results comparable to larger models during inference. SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on the GenEval benchmark, which can be further improved to 0.80 through additional inference scaling, marking a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) in this evaluation framework. The paper highlights the potential for high-quality image generation to become more accessible by optimizing models for various compute budgets. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents several advancements that merit a closer examination.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Scaling Approaches:** The introduction of a depth-growth paradigm and a memory-efficient optimizer signifies a thoughtful approach to handling increased model sizes while minimizing overhead. This feature is crucial in the current trend where larger models often demand exponentially more computational resources. 2. **Model Depth Pruning:** The block importance analysis technique for model compression is innovative and could facilitate broader usability of the technology in environments with limited resources. This is particularly relevant in practical applications where deployment constraints exist. 3. **Inference-time Efficiency:** The repeated sampling strategy is a significant contribution as it addresses a common bottleneck in the deployment of large models—how to balance quality and computational demands at inference time. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Context:** While the paper provides improved scores on GenEval, further validation against a variety of benchmarks or real-world applications would strengthen claims of generalizability. Dependence on a single benchmark may not comprehensively exhibit the model's capabilities. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a detailed comparison with existing methods to elucidate how these innovations concretely improve performance metrics beyond just scoring. There needs to be a clearer discussion of the trade-offs involved in implementation to aid practitioners in decision-making. 3. **Potential Limitations:** The implications of model capacity adjustments on other tasks, especially outside of text-to-image generation, are not fully explored. A broader discussion might provide insights into the versatility of the proposed techniques. **Overall Significance:** SANA-1.5 contributes positively to the field of efficient machine learning model design, addressing two essential aspects: scalability and accessibility of high-quality image generation methods. Its innovative techniques provide important frameworks that could influence future research and practical deployments in generating AI models. Considering the balance between these strengths and weaknesses, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. This reflects its notable contributions while acknowledging that there is room for expansion in validation and comparative analysis. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold immense potential for advancing healthcare, offering rich, longitudinal data that combines structured information with valuable insights from unstructured clinical notes. However, the unstructured nature of clinical text poses significant challenges for secondary applications. Traditional methods for structuring EHR free-text data, such as rule-based systems and multi-stage pipelines, are often limited by their time-consuming configurations and inability to adapt across clinical notes from diverse healthcare settings. Few systems provide a comprehensive attribute extraction for terminologies. While giant large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA 405B excel at structuring tasks, they are slow, costly, and impractical for large-scale use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GENIE, a Generative Note Information Extraction system that leverages LLMs to streamline the structuring of unstructured clinical text into usable data with standardized format. GENIE processes entire paragraphs in a single pass, extracting entities, assertion statuses, locations, modifiers, values, and purposes with high accuracy. Its unified, end-to-end approach simplifies workflows, reduces errors, and eliminates the need for extensive manual intervention. Using a robust data preparation pipeline and fine-tuned small scale LLMs, GENIE achieves competitive performance across multiple information extraction tasks, outperforming traditional tools like cTAKES and MetaMap and can handle extra attributes to be extracted. GENIE strongly enhances real-world applicability and scalability in healthcare systems. By open-sourcing the model and test data, we aim to encourage collaboration and drive further advancements in EHR structurization.

### CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18457v1)
- **Authors**: Yumeng Wang, Zhiyuan Fan, Qingyun Wang, May Fung, Heng Ji
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on extensive multilingual corpora to acquire both language-specific cultural knowledge and general knowledge. Ideally, while LLMs should provide consistent responses to culture-independent questions across languages, we observe significant performance disparities. To address this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given question, we sample multiple responses across different languages, and select the most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining responses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing cross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval augmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages involved in CALM training leads to even higher accuracy and consistency. We offer a qualitative analysis of how cross-lingual consistency can enhance knowledge alignment and explore the method's generalizability. The source code and data of this paper are available on GitHub.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering" presents a novel approach to improving the cross-lingual performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering tasks. It identifies and investigates the performance disparities observed when LLMs respond to culture-independent questions across different languages. The proposed method, termed CALM (Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models), focuses on selecting the most self-consistent multilingual responses to enhance knowledge alignment. By sampling multiple responses from varying languages for a given question and using direct preference optimization (DPO) to refine the model’s consistency across languages, the authors demonstrate an improvement in the model's performance on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets. The effectiveness of the approach is shown in both zero-shot and retrieval-augmented settings, with further gains noted as the number of languages in the training process increases. The paper concludes with a qualitative analysis highlighting the benefits of cross-lingual consistency for knowledge alignment in LLMs, and it provides access to the source code and data via GitHub. ### Rigorous Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The novelty of the CALM approach primarily lies in its innovative application of direct preference optimization between sampled multilingual responses to improve consistency and accuracy in LLMs. Unlike previous methods that may rely exclusively on large-scale training or fine-tuning techniques, CALM’s strategy focuses on leveraging self-consistency and cross-lingual alignment. This represents a shift in focus from simply improving raw accuracy to refining the underlying knowledge base of LLMs. One of the significant strengths of the paper is its empirical evaluation on established datasets (MEDQA and X-CSQA). This substantiates its claims and demonstrates the practical applicability of CALM in real-world scenarios. The findings that increasing the diversity of languages in training leads to enhanced outcomes supports the robustness of the proposed methodology. However, potential weaknesses include the reliance on the quality and homogeneity of the multilingual corpora used and whether the method effectively scales across all language pairs. The implications of applying this method to low-resource languages or various dialects need further exploration. Additionally, while the qualitative analysis presents promising insights, it would benefit from quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art systems to contextualize CALM's improvements more clearly. In conclusion, CALM manages to contribute to the field by offering a structured approach that addresses cross-lingual inconsistencies, enhancing multilingual question answering. Its direct preference optimization method is a thoughtful and innovative solution that could inspire further research in LLM advancement. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a robust contribution to language model development, particularly in multilingual contexts, while acknowledging some limitations regarding the universality and applicability of the approach across diverse linguistic landscapes.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18460v2)
- **Authors**: Minghua He, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Wenjie Yin, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code translation is a crucial activity in the software development and maintenance process, and researchers have recently begun to focus on using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for code translation. However, existing LLMs only learn the contextual semantics of code during pre-training, neglecting executability information closely related to the execution state of the code, which results in unguaranteed code executability and unreliable automated code translation. To address this issue, we propose ExeCoder, an LLM specifically designed for code translation, aimed at utilizing executability representations such as functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in code translation. To evaluate the effectiveness of ExeCoder, we manually enhanced the widely used benchmark TransCoder-test, resulting in a benchmark called TransCoder-test-X that serves LLMs. Evaluation of TransCoder-test-X indicates that ExeCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in code translation, surpassing existing open-source code LLMs by over 10.88% to 38.78% and over 27.44% to 42.97% on two metrics, and even outperforms the renowned closed-source LLM GPT-4o. Website: https://execoder4trans.github.io/
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "ExeCoder: Empowering Large Language Models with Executability Representation for Code Translation" introduces ExeCoder, a large language model (LLM) tailored for code translation. The authors argue that existing LLMs are limited in their ability to guarantee code executability because they primarily focus on contextual semantics without incorporating executability information, such as functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies. To rectify this, ExeCoder is designed to leverage executability representations in its architecture. The paper presents a benchmark enhancement of the widely used TransCoder-test, resulting in the creation of TransCoder-test-X, which serves to evaluate the performance of code translation models. The results demonstrate that ExeCoder surpasses existing open-source LLMs by significant margins (10.88% to 38.78%) across two performance metrics and outperforms the well-recognized closed-source model GPT-4o. ### Critical Evaluation: The paper showcases a notable advancement in code translation, a field increasingly reliant on LLMs. Its primary contribution lies in addressing a clear gap in existing models — the lack of incorporative executability information, which can lead to inefficient or non-executable translations. #### Strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: By incorporating executability representations, ExeCoder addresses a pertinent issue that affects the reliability of code translation, marking a significant shift from traditional LLM training focuses. 2. **Benchmark Development**: The introduction and validation of a new benchmark (TransCoder-test-X) aids in establishing a clearer standard for evaluating code translation models. This is an important contribution to the field, allowing for systematic comparisons. 3. **Performance Validation**: The empirical results demonstrating substantial improvements over existing models provide solid evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach, potentially motivating further research and application of similar techniques. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: The specifics of how executability representations are integrated into the model architecture could be elaborated further. For instance, details about performance under varying programming languages or complexity levels remain unclear. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the paper reports significant improvements, it would benefit from a discussion on the evaluation metrics used and their alignment with real-world coding challenges outside benchmark settings. 3. **Broader Impact**: The paper briefly touches on the implications of improved executability but lacks a deep dive into how this could transform software development practices beyond just performance metrics. ### Overall Influence: ExeCoder is positioned to significantly influence the field of code translation by presenting a clear methodology to improve LLMs. Its focus on executability represents an important direction for future research, encouraging other scholars to consider execution context in model training for improved software practices. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a strong but not unassailable contribution. While the paper’s novelty and effectiveness are evident and significant improvements are made, the need for more detailed discussion on generalizability and broader impacts tempers the overall assessment. Nonetheless, ExeCoder can be expected to spur advancements and further research in the area of code translation and LLM integration.

- **Authors**: Yanxia Deng, Aozhong Zhang, Naigang Wang, Selcuk Gurses, Zi Yang, Penghang Yin
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "CLoQ: Enhancing Fine-Tuning of Quantized LLMs via Calibrated LoRA Initialization" presents a novel approach designed to improve the fine-tuning of quantized large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The authors identify the challenges presented by reduced representational precision of quantized weights in LLMs when applying LoRA.

### A Tool for In-depth Analysis of Code Execution Reasoning of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18482v1)
- **Authors**: Changshu Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand
- **Abstract**: Code Executing Reasoning is becoming a new non-functional metric that assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) in programming tasks. State-of-the-art frameworks (CodeMind or REval) and benchmarks (CruxEval) usually focus on LLM's prediction of a given code's input/output or intermediate variable states/values on limited programs. However, there is no tool for more in-depth analysis of the results. Without such a tool, the observations about LLM's code execution reasoning cannot be generalized to more datasets, preventing the research community and practitioners from devising the next generation of LLMs with better code execution reasoning abilities. This paper introduces ExeRScope, a series of tools and heuristics to analyze the result of code execution reasoning frameworks to understand better the impact of code properties in the studied benchmarks on the code execution reasoning. With such tooling, analysis can be generalized to code with similar properties without the urgent need to design more benchmarks, which is a cumbersome effort.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces ExeRScope, a novel tool designed to facilitate an in-depth analysis of Code Executing Reasoning (CER) capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While existing frameworks and benchmarks such as CodeMind, REval, and CruxEval focus primarily on evaluating LLMs based on their ability to predict outputs or intermediate states for limited programming tasks, they lack comprehensive tools for deeper analysis. ExeRScope aims to fill this gap by providing mechanisms to analyze the results from existing frameworks, thereby allowing for a better understanding of how various code properties influence CER on benchmarks. This approach enables researchers and practitioners to generalize findings to similar datasets without the pressing necessity to create new benchmarks, promoting the advancement of LLMs with enhanced coding reasoning capabilities. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a thoughtful and timely contribution to the field of natural language processing, particularly in the context of code execution reasoning. The novelty lies in its focus on providing a structured approach to analyzing CER beyond the traditional prediction metrics, which is vital for improving LLMs’ programming capabilities. **Strengths:** 1. **Gap Identification**: The paper effectively identifies a significant gap in the existing research landscape regarding the analysis of LLMs’ code reasoning skills. 2. **Practical Tool Development**: The introduction of ExeRScope as a set of tools for deeper analysis promises to provide much-needed support for researchers, facilitating a more profound understanding of the LIModel's performance in programming tasks. 3. **Generalizability**: The framework’s ability to generalize insights across code properties offers practical implications for future research and LLM development. 4. **Increasing Research Efficiency**: By reducing the immediacy of creating new benchmarks for each study, the proposed tool can streamline research efforts within this space. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Application**: While ExeRScope contributes valuable analysis techniques, the paper does not thoroughly explore its applicability across a wide range of programming languages or diverse programming contexts. 2. **Evaluation of Effectiveness**: The paper could benefit from empirical data demonstrating the effectiveness of ExeRScope in practice, such as case studies or user feedback from deployers. 3. **Complexity and Usability**: A critical analysis of the usability and accessibility of the tools described would strengthen the contribution, especially for less experienced researchers. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents a promising advancement in the evaluation of LLMs’ programming capabilities, addressing a notable research gap. However, it would benefit from further empirical validation and wider applicability discussions. **Score: 8**

### Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18512v1)

- **Abstract**: Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch" addresses the challenges encountered in training large language models (LLMs) across distributed systems. Traditional methods require co-located accelerators equipped with low-latency, high-bandwidth communication to effectively exchange parameter gradients at each gradient step. The authors propose enhancements to the existing DiLoCo algorithm by implementing three significant modifications:  1. They synchronize only a subset of parameters sequentially, lowering the peak bandwidth requirement. 2. The training process continues in workers during synchronization, which reduces the training time. 3. Data exchanged among workers is quantized, further minimizing bandwidth usage.  Through experiments, the authors demonstrate that their improved method can distribute the training of billion-scale parameters while maintaining performance quality comparable to traditional methods, achieving a bandwidth reduction by two orders of magnitude. **Evaluation**: The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to alleviating the rigorous communication demands typically associated with the distributed training of LLMs. By allowing asynchronous communication and reducing bandwidth needs through parameter subset synchronization and quantization, it offers a fresh perspective on efficient distributed training. Furthermore, it stands out by allowing simultaneous training and synchronization, which is a considerable practical enhancement. However, while the improvements presented are innovative, the extent of contribution must be weighed against current research trends. Existing methods tend to incorporate various forms of communication reduction and model parallelism, and while the sequential synchronization of parameters is certainly a novel twist, the theoretical basis for the bandwidth estimation and the practical implications in varied network environments could have been addressed more rigorously. Moreover, the paper's reliance on experimental results without extensive theoretical backing leaves some questions about the scalability and robustness of the proposed modifications across diverse scenarios. In summary, the paper brings together several meaningful modifications that contribute positively to the distributed training discourse. However, the lack of deep theoretical insights and possible limitations in applicability slightly temper its overall impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a recognition of the paper's contributions to effective communication strategies in distributed training while also noting its limitations in theoretical grounding and comprehensive analysis of broader applicability. It is a solid contribution but may not redefine the landscape of the field dramatically.

### Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18516v1)
- **Authors**: Guanqun Cao, Ryan Mckenna, John Oyekan
- **Abstract**: Object rearrangement is a significant task for collaborative robots, where they are directed to manipulate objects into a specified goal state. Determining the placement of objects is a major challenge that influences the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position and are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and effectiveness.In this paper, we propose a framework of language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Particularly, our approach mimics human reasoning by using past successful experiences as a reference to infer the desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method can generalise to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequential orders.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with Large Language Models" addresses the challenges faced in object rearrangement tasks for collaborative robots. Current models typically rely on pre-collected datasets, limiting their effectiveness in real-world settings. The authors propose a new framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable robots to infer desired object placements by referencing past experiences, thereby mimicking human reasoning. This method allows for the interpretation of free-form language instructions and enhances generalizability to various objects without the need for extensive retraining. Experimental results indicate that the framework successfully handles complex rearrangement tasks, including those with extended instruction sequences. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of LLMs into the domain of robotic object rearrangement. By leveraging the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs, the authors have positioned their approach as a significant step forward from previous methods that depended heavily on curated datasets and rigid instruction sets. This innovation allows the model to operate in a zero-shot manner, which is a noteworthy advancement in the field as it broadens the scope of commands a robot can understand and act upon. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: By adapting LLMs for object rearrangement, the paper introduces a novel methodology that deviates from traditional dataset limitations. 2. **Generalizability**: The ability to handle free-form language instructions indicates the potential for broader applications in real-world scenarios. 3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors provide experimental results that validate the effectiveness of their approach, supporting their claims of improved performance over existing methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns**: While the zero-shot capability is impressive, the framework's performance in an uncontrolled environment with highly variable object types and complex instructions remains to be fully demonstrated. 2. **Contextual Understanding**: The reliance on past experiences may limit the system's ability to adapt to novel situations that deviate significantly from previously encountered scenarios. **Conclusion**: The paper represents a valuable contribution to the field of robotics, particularly in enhancing collaborative technologies with natural language capabilities. Its approach to combining human-like reasoning with robotic tasks could inspire further research and development. However, challenges regarding scalability and contextual adaptability may require additional attention in future work. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's meaningful advancements in the field and its robust experimental support, balanced against the potential limitations regarding scalability and adaptability to new contexts.

### Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18532v1)
- **Authors**: Anmol Goel, Yaxi Hu, Iryna Gurevych, Amartya Sanyal
- **Abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the \textit{\underline{P}rivate \underline{S}teering for LLM \underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation editing and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated probabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our \textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment" investigates the alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, particularly in terms of curbing undesirable behaviors like hallucinations during inference. It introduces the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm, which enhances LLM activation editing while ensuring differential privacy (DP) to prevent the leaking of private dataset information. The authors evaluate the PSA algorithm across seven benchmarks, demonstrating its capability to maintain alignment and text generation quality while adhering to DP guarantees. They also introduce a Membership Inference Attack (MIA) tailored for assessing privacy in the context of activation editing. The experimental results indicate that PSA achieves better privacy protections than existing non-private methods without significant degradation in performance. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: This paper contributes significantly to the intersection of LLM alignment and privacy, an area of growing importance due to the sensitive nature of training data. While the concept of alignment editing isn't entirely new, the specific integration of differential privacy into this process is innovative. The introduction of the PSA algorithm uniquely addresses the risk of information leakage in a context where direct privacy concerns have not been fully explored. **Strengths**: 1. **Timeliness**: Given the rising concerns about data privacy in AI, this work is timely and addresses a critical need to align models without compromising sensitive information. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The experimental framework appears robust, evaluating the PSA algorithm on various model sizes and types, which enhances the generalizability of the findings. 3. **Novel Evaluation Tool**: The development of a specialized MIA focused on the context of activation editing provides a new method for assessing privacy in this domain, diversifying the tools available for privacy auditing. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Practical Implementation**: While the theoretical framework is strong, the practical implications of implementing the PSA algorithm in real-world settings are less clear. The paper could benefit from additional discussion on scalability and computational costs. 2. **Performance Metrics**: While the paper states minimal loss in performance, a more detailed analysis could provide insight into where exactly performance might suffer (if at all), particularly in edge cases or highly nuanced applications. 3. **Broader Application Scope**: The focus is mainly on specific LLMs and benchmarks; it would be beneficial to see whether the findings apply universally across different architectures beyond those tested. **Influence on the Field**: The proposed work could profoundly impact the way privacy concerns are integrated into model training and deployment phases, potentially setting a precedent for future research at the intersection of ethical AI, privacy, and large-scale language models. It calls for attention to the necessity of privacy-preserving techniques in AI development, contributing to the unfolding discussions around responsible AI innovation. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper’s strong theoretical contributions and practical relevance in addressing a critical niche within LLM development. The novel application of differential privacy for model alignment is significant and opens avenues for future research.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18533v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Ding, Lijun Li, Bing Cao, Jing Shao
- **Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin. Data and Models are released under: \href{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}{\texttt{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}}
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models" addresses challenges in deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical applications. Traditional safety fine-tuning methods struggle with complex cases and disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. The authors identify a significant gap in safety visual reasoning within existing methods. To tackle this issue, they propose the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, which is designed for multi-image inputs with safety-focused Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels, enabling fine-grained reasoning. The evaluation shows that fine-tuning the model InternVL2.5-8B using the MIS dataset leads to substantial improvements in performance on multi-image tasks requiring safety reasoning, achieving an average accuracy increase of 0.83% across general tasks and a notable decrease in Attack Success Rate (ASR) on safety benchmarks. The dataset and models are available for public access. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the fine-tuning of Vision-Language Models by introducing the MIS dataset, which emphasizes safety visual reasoning.

We propose in this article, a neural architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) to provide this information. This solution can arguably capture spatial correlations more effectively than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the paper, we describe the methodology and proposed neural architecture and show the experiments' results with a standard dataset. We show that the proposed ViT architecture improves the metrics compared to a method based on a CNN.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Learning Priors of Human Motion With Vision Transformers" addresses the challenge of understanding human movement patterns in various contexts, which is important for applications like urban mobility studies and robotic navigation in populated spaces. The authors present a neural architecture utilizing Vision Transformers (ViTs) to capture spatial correlations in human motion more effectively than traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The paper details their methodology and the architecture of the proposed model, alongside experimental results using a standard dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed ViT architecture outperforms the CNN-based approach in relevant metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a novel approach by applying Vision Transformers to the task of human motion prediction and analysis, a field that has primarily relied on CNNs.

### BounTCHA: A CAPTCHA Utilizing Boundary Identification in AI-extended Videos
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18565v1)
- **Authors**: Lehao Lin, Ke Wang, Maha Abdallah, Wei Cai
- **Abstract**: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) especially multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has enabled it to understand text, images, videos, and other multimedia data, allowing AI systems to execute various tasks based on human-provided prompts. However, AI-powered bots have increasingly been able to bypass most existing CAPTCHA systems, posing significant security threats to web applications. This makes the design of new CAPTCHA mechanisms an urgent priority. We observe that humans are highly sensitive to shifts and abrupt changes in videos, while current AI systems still struggle to comprehend and respond to such situations effectively. Based on this observation, we design and implement BounTCHA, a CAPTCHA mechanism that leverages human perception of boundaries in video transitions and disruptions. By utilizing AI's capability to expand original videos with prompts, we introduce unexpected twists and changes to create a pipeline for generating short videos for CAPTCHA purposes. We develop a prototype and conduct experiments to collect data on humans' time biases in boundary identification. This data serves as a basis for distinguishing between human users and bots. Additionally, we perform a detailed security analysis of BounTCHA, demonstrating its resilience against various types of attacks. We hope that BounTCHA will act as a robust defense, safeguarding millions of web applications in the AI-driven era.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "BounTCHA: A CAPTCHA Utilizing Boundary Identification in AI-extended Videos" addresses the increasing challenge of AI-powered bots bypassing traditional CAPTCHA systems. It introduces BounTCHA, a new CAPTCHA mechanism that takes advantage of human sensitivity to video transitions and boundaries, which are areas where AI still struggles. BounTCHA generates short video snippets that incorporate unexpected changes, requiring human users to identify these boundaries effectively. The authors implement a prototype and conduct experiments focusing on human responses to video shifts, aiming to create a reliable distinction between humans and bots. The paper includes a security analysis of BounTCHA, asserting its effectiveness against various attack vectors, and advocates for its use in enhancing web application security in an AI-dominated landscape. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of BounTCHA lies primarily in its approach to leveraging the difference in boundary perception between humans and AI, especially in the context of video rather than static images or text, which are common in CAPTCHAs. This adds a layer of interaction that is not commonly explored in the CAPTCHA domain. The authors' focus on real-time video changes may offer a more robust method to thwart AI bots, given that current AI systems may not adequately interpret motion or abrupt visual shifts as humans do. However, the paper has some limitations that should be considered. Firstly, while the concept of utilizing video boundaries is innovative, the practical implementation of this approach might face challenges regarding accessibility and usability. Video CAPTCHAs could become frustrating for users if the boundaries are too intricate, resulting in a potential decline in user engagement. Additionally, the paper does not extensively discuss the adaptability of the BounTCHA mechanism, especially as AI technology continues to evolve – it is critical to anticipate how sophisticated AI might counteract this new form of CAPTCHA. The experimental data provided on human time biases in boundary identification is a strong point, offering empirical support to the hypothesis. Nevertheless, the scalability of this solution across diverse populations and video content types remains unaddressed in the abstract. Considering the innovation presented in using video and human perception for CAPTCHA design, alongside the recognized need for improved security measures against AI bots, the paper represents a significant step forward. The strengths largely outweigh the weaknesses, yet caution should be exercised regarding practical challenges in deployment and AI's fast-paced advancements. Overall, while BounTCHA presents a promising addition to the CAPTCHA landscape, its real-world application and long-term effectiveness against evolving AI threats will need ongoing assessment as technology progresses.  **Score: 7**

### Token-Hungry, Yet Precise: DeepSeek R1 Highlights the Need for Multi-Step Reasoning Over Speed in MATH
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18576v1)
- **Authors**: Evgenii Evstafev
- **Abstract**: This study investigates the performance of the DeepSeek R1 language model on 30 challenging mathematical problems derived from the MATH dataset, problems that previously proved unsolvable by other models under time constraints. Unlike prior work, this research removes time limitations to explore whether DeepSeek R1's architecture, known for its reliance on token-based reasoning, can achieve accurate solutions through a multi-step process. The study compares DeepSeek R1 with four other models (gemini-1.5-flash-8b, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, llama3.1:8b, and mistral-8b-latest) across 11 temperature settings. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves superior accuracy on these complex problems but generates significantly more tokens than other models, confirming its token-intensive approach. The findings highlight a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving with large language models: while DeepSeek R1 excels in accuracy, its reliance on extensive token generation may not be optimal for applications requiring rapid responses. The study underscores the importance of considering task-specific requirements when selecting an LLM and emphasizes the role of temperature settings in optimizing performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Token-Hungry, Yet Precise: DeepSeek R1 Highlights the Need for Multi-Step Reasoning Over Speed in MATH" examines the DeepSeek R1 language model's performance on complex mathematical problems from the MATH dataset. Unlike other models that struggled under time constraints, the study removes these limitations to test DeepSeek R1’s ability to provide accurate solutions using multi-step reasoning. The model's performance is compared to four others across varied temperature settings. Results indicate that DeepSeek R1 achieves superior accuracy but at the cost of generating significantly more tokens, revealing a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The study emphasizes that one must consider task-specific needs and the influence of temperature settings when selecting large language models (LLMs). **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel investigation into the balance between accuracy and efficiency in language model performance for mathematical problem solving, specifically emphasizing the need for multi-step reasoning. While the focus on token generation is insightful, other studies have already explored similar themes of speed versus accuracy in LLMs. However, the unique methodology of removing time constraints explicitly to measure performance with multi-step reasoning provides a fresh angle to this ongoing discourse. Strengths of the paper include its thorough empirical analysis of the models involved, systematic examination across different temperature settings, and its clear articulation of findings regarding token generation and accuracy trade-offs. These contribute substantially to understanding how to optimize LLM performance in specific contexts like mathematical reasoning. However, the paper could benefit from a more extensive exploration of the underlying reasons for DeepSeek R1's token-intensive approach and how this might relate to architectural design choices that distinguish it from others. Moreover, while the findings are compelling, the paper may underrepresent practical implications; for example, real-world applications often require both speed and accuracy, and this study primarily addresses the former through an experimental design that deprioritizes speed. The paper successfully highlights an important dimension of model performance and may influence future research to consider more nuanced approaches to tuning LLMs for specific tasks. Nevertheless, its impact may be limited by the extent to which its findings can be generalized to broader LLM applications outside the mathematical domain. **Score: 7**   The score reflects a solid contribution to the field with meaningful insights about the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in LLMs, which could influence future research and applications. However, the paper falls short of groundbreaking innovation due to its partial overlap with existing studies and the need for a deeper discussion on practical applications.

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores a phenomenon called "underthinking" in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's o1, where the model shifts between different reasoning paths without in-depth exploration, particularly affecting performance on complex mathematical tasks. The authors conducted experiments on three challenging datasets with two representative o1-like models, illustrating a correlation between rapid thought switching and incorrect outputs. They introduced a novel metric to quantify underthinking based on token efficiency and proposed a new decoding strategy—thought switching penalty TIP—to mitigate underthinking by promoting deeper reasoning before transitioning thoughts. The results indicate improved accuracy in challenging problem-solving without model fine-tuning, enriching the understanding of reasoning inefficiencies in LLMs and offering practical enhancements. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents a noteworthy investigation into the limitations of reasoning in o1-like LLMs, focusing on the issue of underthinking, which has not been thoroughly addressed in existing literature. Its introduction of the thought switching penalty TIP provides a fresh approach to enhancing problem-solving by encouraging more deliberate reasoning strategies. By quantifying underthinking with a novel metric, the authors provide a measurable aspect of this cognitive inefficiency, which could pave the way for future research. However, the paper's novelty may be somewhat tempered by the existing body of knowledge surrounding LLM behaviors and reasoning strategies. While the findings are significant in identifying a specific flaw—underthinking—they may not substantially advance the theoretical understanding of LLMs’ cognitive processes. The experiments are limited to two models and three datasets, which, while providing some insight, could benefit from broader validation across various architectures and problems. Furthermore, while the proposed TIP strategy shows promise, the lack of exploration into the underlying mechanisms that lead to underthinking might hinder the development of more comprehensive solutions. The results, while showing improvement, might also be influenced by other factors not sufficiently controlled in the experiments. In summary, the paper presents a valuable contribution by identifying a novel behavioral phenomenon in LLMs and introducing a method for improvement. However, its impact may be limited due to the narrow focus and experimental scope.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's solid identification of a real issue affecting LLM reasoning processes, alongside practical solutions, yet acknowledges its limitations in scope and depth of theoretical contribution to the field.

- **Abstract**: Understanding and modeling lighting effects are fundamental tasks in computer vision and graphics. Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces DiffusionRenderer, a novel neural framework designed for both inverse and forward rendering by utilizing video diffusion models. It seeks to solve challenges associated with traditional physically-based rendering (PBR), which requires detailed scene information—often difficult to acquire in practice. DiffusionRenderer employs an inverse rendering model to extract G-buffers from real-world video footage, facilitating image editing and generating training data for rendering. The forward rendering component produces photorealistic images based on these G-buffers without needing explicit light transport simulation. The experimental results indicate that DiffusionRenderer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both rendering tasks, presenting practical applications such as relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion from a single video input. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper showcases a noteworthy advancement by combining inverse and forward rendering tasks within a cohesive framework that leverages the strengths of video diffusion models. Such an approach is recognized as innovative since it integrates concepts from both traditional rendering and modern neural networks, thus pushing the boundaries of what is achievable with minimal scene data. **Significance:** By addressing practical limitations posed by PBR, particularly in real-world applications where scene geometry and lighting conditions can be challenging to obtain, DiffusionRenderer positions itself as a significant contribution to the field. Its ability to generate G-buffers from real video inputs and use these for photorealistic rendering can enhance workflows in graphics and computer vision. **Strengths:** 1. The integration of inverse and forward rendering is compelling and addresses a critical gap in existing methods. 2. Demonstrated superiority over state-of-the-art techniques suggests that it offers a more accessible and efficient approach to rendering tasks. 3. Practical applications mentioned—such as material editing and relighting from a single input—showcase the real-world utility of the model. **Weaknesses:** 1. While the results are promising, the reliance on high-quality video inputs may limit applicability in scenarios where video quality is suboptimal. 2. The methodology might require extensive computational resources, which could impact accessibility for broader user demographics. 3. The paper may benefit from more extensive comparisons with other emerging techniques beyond the state-of-the-art. A deeper analysis of the limitations and edge cases of the methodology would strengthen the discussion. **Potential Influence:** The paper is likely to foster further research into neural-based rendering methods, especially as it relates to the handling of real-world complexities in scene representation. It opens avenues for innovative applications in augmented reality, game development, and other interactive graphics areas. Given the strong foundation of novelty, practical implications, and performance improvements, the contribution is significant but tempered by some limitations in scope and dependence on certain conditions. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yinbo Chen, Rohit Girdhar, Xiaolong Wang, Sai Saketh Rambhatla, Ishan Misra
- **Abstract**: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel image tokenization method called the Diffusion Tokenizer (DiTo), which optimizes the process of generating compact visual representations for image generation models. The authors propose utilizing a single diffusion L2 loss as a learning objective, simplifying the training process compared to existing state-of-the-art methods that involve a complex mix of heuristics and multiple loss functions. DiTo is designed to facilitate scalability while maintaining competitive performance in terms of image reconstruction and downstream generative tasks. The approach is self-supervised, distinguishing it from prevailing supervised tokenizer models, and shows promise in achieving better or comparable quality outcomes. **Evaluation:** The paper stands out in the field of image generation and tokenization for several reasons. Firstly, by identifying a simple yet effective training criterion using diffusion L2 loss, the authors tackle a significant challenge in the image tokenizer landscape, where complexity often hinders practical implementations. This simplification may enable broader accessibility of advanced generative models by lowering the barrier to entry for researchers. Secondly, the theoretical grounding and design decisions provided reinforce the framework's scalability, which is critical in an era of increasing demands for high-dimensional representation efficiency. The self-supervised nature of DiTo adds a significant advantage, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. However, while the novelty of the approach is appreciable, there are some limitations. The comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art tokenizers primarily focuses on performance metrics without sufficiently addressing the underlying mechanisms that may influence the quality of learned representations across diverse datasets. More extensive experiments across varied conditions, data types, and potential challenges could provide a clearer view of the robustness of the proposed method. Overall, the paper successfully advances the discourse around image tokenization by providing a scalable and efficient method that could influence future designs in generative modeling. Given its contribution to simplifying training processes and enhancing image representation quality, I assess this work as a valuable addition to the field. **Score: 8**

Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces BARNN, a Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network aimed at addressing the limitations of traditional autoregressive and recurrent models in managing uncertainty, particularly in scientific applications like solving partial differential equations (PDEs), molecular generation, and machine learning force fields. BARNN employs a variational Bayesian framework, specifically leveraging variational dropout methods to ensure scalability for large recurrent networks. The authors propose a novel temporal variant of the “Variational Mixtures of Posteriors” prior (tVAMP-prior) to enhance the efficiency and calibration of Bayesian inference. Experimental results indicate that BARNN achieves competitive accuracy against current methods while significantly improving uncertainty quantification and the modeling of long-range dependencies. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of BARNN lies in its integration of Bayesian techniques with autoregressive and recurrent networks, which has not been comprehensively addressed in existing literature. The development of the tVAMP-prior is a notable contribution, given the increasing importance of efficient Bayesian inference in complex models. Furthermore, the empirical validation of BARNN across varied applications, including PDE modeling and molecular generation, shows its versatility and practical significance. However, the paper does present some weaknesses. The reliance on variational dropout methods might be seen as limiting, as alternative approaches for the Bayesian framework could also be explored. Moreover, while the experimental results are promising, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with a broader range of existing models. This would provide a clearer perspective on the specific advantages and potential limitations of BARNN in comparison to both traditional and modern Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods. Despite these weaknesses, the paper effectively addresses a crucial gap in the field regarding uncertainty management in autoregressive and recurrent architectures. The systematic approach to improving both predictive performance and uncertainty quantification positions BARNN as a significant addition to the landscape of machine learning and statistical modeling. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, marked by innovative methodology and practical implications. However, it is tempered by the need for a wider exploration of alternative frameworks and a more robust comparative analysis.

### Structure Development in List-Sorting Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18666v1)
- **Authors**: Einar Urdshals, Jasmina Urdshals
- **Abstract**: We study how a one-layer attention-only transformer develops relevant structures while learning to sort lists of numbers. At the end of training, the model organizes its attention heads in two main modes that we refer to as vocabulary-splitting and copy-suppression. Both represent simpler modes than having multiple heads handle overlapping ranges of numbers. Interestingly, vocabulary-splitting is present regardless of whether we use weight decay, a common regularization technique thought to drive simplification, supporting the thesis that neural networks naturally prefer simpler solutions. We relate copy-suppression to a mechanism in GPT-2 and investigate its functional role in our model. Guided by insights from a developmental analysis of the model, we identify features in the training data that drive the model's final acquired solution. This provides a concrete example of how the training data shape the internal organization of transformers, paving the way for future studies that could help us better understand how LLMs develop their internal structures.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Structure Development in List-Sorting Transformers" investigates how a one-layer attention-only transformer model learns to sort lists of numbers and develops relevant internal structures during training. The authors identify two primary organizational strategies of the model's attention heads: "vocabulary-splitting" and "copy-suppression." The former occurs consistently irrespective of the weight decay regularization, suggesting that simpler solutions are preferentially selected by neural networks. The authors correlate "copy-suppression" with mechanisms found in GPT-2, exploring its functional implications. They also analyze the training data to understand features influencing the model's final structure, highlighting the role of the data in shaping transformer configurations and paving the way for further research on internal structures of large language models. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several notable strengths. First, it contributes to a deeper understanding of attention mechanisms in transformers, specifically in relation to how these models simplify their structures during learning. This aspect is novel since it shifts the focus from just performance metrics to the underlying processes that allow models to operate efficiently. The experiments yield insights by demonstrating how certain functional strategies emerge in response to specific training tasks, which could have implications for the design of future models. Moreover, the relationship drawn between "copy-suppression" and existing mechanisms in GPT-2 allows for a comparative analysis, linking the findings of this study to broader transformations within the field of neural network architecture. However, the paper exhibits some weaknesses. Though it identifies important organizational structures, the limited scope of the "one-layer attention-only transformer" may constrain its applicability to more complex systems. The findings may not necessarily extrapolate to multi-layer or multi-head architectures, which are prevalent in state-of-the-art models. Additionally, while the insights regarding the training data's role are pertinent, the analysis may benefit from a wider range of datasets to confirm generalizability. Overall, while the paper provides essential insights and fosters dialogue about the internal workings of transformers, the limitations in model complexity and dataset variety temper its novelty. Given the contributions made and the corresponding weaknesses, I would assign this paper a score of 7.  **Score: 7**

### Simulation Streams: A Programming Paradigm for Controlling Large Language Models and Building Complex Systems with Generative AI
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18668v1)
- **Authors**: Peter Sunehag, Joel Z. Leibo
- **Abstract**: We introduce Simulation Streams, a programming paradigm designed to efficiently control and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex, dynamic simulations and agentic workflows. Our primary goal is to create a minimally interfering framework that harnesses the agentic abilities of LLMs while addressing their limitations in maintaining consistency, selectively ignoring/including information, and enforcing strict world rules. Simulation Streams achieves this through a state-based approach where variables are modified in sequential steps by "operators," producing output on a recurring format and adhering to consistent rules for state variables. This approach focus the LLMs on defined tasks, while aiming to have the context stream remain "in-distribution". The approach incorporates an Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture to write programs in a more intuitive manner, facilitating reuse of workflows across different components and entities. This ECS approach enhances the modularity of the output stream, allowing for complex, multi-entity simulations while maintaining format consistency, information control, and rule enforcement. It is supported by a custom editor that aids in creating, running, and analyzing simulations. We demonstrate the versatility of simulation streams through an illustrative example of an ongoing market economy simulation, a social simulation of three characters playing a game of catch in a park and a suite of classical reinforcement learning benchmark tasks. These examples showcase Simulation Streams' ability to handle complex, evolving scenarios over 100s-1000s of iterations, facilitate comparisons between different agent workflows and models, and maintain consistency and continued interesting developments in LLM-driven simulations.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces **Simulation Streams**, a novel programming paradigm aimed at effectively controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) for dynamic simulations and workflows. The approach addresses key limitations of LLMs, such as consistency and rule enforcement, by employing a state-based system where variables are manipulated sequentially through operators. This framework emphasizes task focus and context adherence by maintaining in-distribution context. Utilizing an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture enhances the modularity and intuitiveness of program creation, enabling effective reuse across different simulations. The authors present various illustrative examples, including a market economy simulation and social interactions, demonstrating the paradigm's capability to manage complex scenarios over extensive iterations and ensuring consistent outcomes from LLMs. The paper also features a custom editor to facilitate simulation design and analysis. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The introduction of Simulation Streams as a programming paradigm for LLMs offers a systematic way to conduct extensive simulations in a controlled manner. The combination of a state-based approach with ECS architecture is a notable innovation that enables better organization and modularity in programming. 2. **Practical Applications:** The illustrative examples provided are diverse and relevant, showcasing real-world applications of the proposed paradigm in economically and socially rich contexts. This enhances the paper's practical significance. 3. **Addressing Limitations of LLMs:** The framework seeks to mitigate some important limitations of LLMs, focusing on aspects such as consistency and adherence to rules, which are crucial for reliable outputs in simulations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Validation:** While the examples are illustrative, the paper would benefit from empirical validation through extensive testing and benchmarking against existing paradigms. This could strengthen claims about the framework's effectiveness and superiority. 2. **Limited Theoretical Foundation**: The paper could elaborate more on the theoretical underpinnings of the ECS architecture in this context, especially how it directly leads to improvements in performance and modularity. 3. **Over-Dependence on LLMs:** The framework heavily relies on the capabilities of LLMs. Over time, advancements in the field may change the relevance or desirability of such a design, which could potentially limit the longevity and applicability of the proposed approach. **Potential Influence:** Simulation Streams has the potential to bridge the gap between programming paradigms and generative AI applications, particularly in sectors needing complex simulations. However, its long-term impact will likely be contingent upon continued advancements in LLM technology and the evolution of AI capabilities. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a sound contribution with a moderate level of novelty and significance in the field. The strengths of the approach and practical applications are notable, though the lack of extensive empirical data and empirical grounding detracts from its overall impact and reliability. The framework opens avenues for future research and application, but it requires further validation to fully establish its efficacy in comparison to existing methodologies.

### Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18672v1)
- **Authors**: Yansong Qu, Dian Chen, Xinyang Li, Xiaofan Li, Shengchuan Zhang, Liujuan Cao, Rongrong Ji
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in 3D scene editing have been propelled by the rapid development of generative models. Existing methods typically utilize generative models to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture modifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a character's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control over the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to precisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian Splatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region and the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of control points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing. DYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to establish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming suboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired editing regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling flexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided by control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect and quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Drag Your Gaussian: Effective Drag-Based Editing with Score Distillation for 3D Gaussian Splatting" introduces a novel method named DYG for enhancing 3D scene editing, particularly focusing on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing generative models primarily facilitate text-guided editing for texture modifications but struggle with geometric changes and spatial control. DYG addresses these challenges by using 3D masks and control points, allowing users to define specific editing regions and directions. This method integrates an implicit triplane representation to improve editing quality in sparse regions of 3DGS, and introduces a drag-based Latent Diffusion Model with a novel Drag-SDS loss function, which provides multi-view consistent and fine-grained editing capabilities. Comparative experiments show that DYG outperforms traditional methods in both qualitative and quantitative measures of editing effectiveness. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a clear and innovative approach to 3D scene editing, distinguishing itself from existing methods by addressing geometric modifications, a notable gap in current literature. The introduction of DYG is particularly valuable as it combines user-friendly controls (3D masks and control points) with advanced modeling to produce high-quality results. This method enhances not only the accuracy of edits but also expands the potential uses of 3D editing tools in various applications, including gaming, animation, and virtual reality. However, the paper could improve in several areas. First, while it highlights improvements in editing quality, the methodology might benefit from a deeper exploration of how it handles complex geometries beyond the tested parameters. Additionally, the reliance on a Latent Diffusion Model raises questions about computational efficiency and accessibility for wider user bases that may not have high-performance hardware. The paper might also be strengthened by more extensive discussions on potential limitations and areas for future research. Notably, while the practical implications of the DYG method are significant, the novelty of its contributions could be seen as incremental to some extent, given that the general idea of using generative models to assist in scene editing is not new. However, the specificity of the implementation and resulting performance merits recognition. In summary, DYG introduces important enhancements to 3D editing and demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods. It has the potential to influence future work in 3D modeling and editing, but the implementation specifics and limitations merit additional attention.  **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Canxuan Gang
- **Abstract**: Human motion generation is a significant pursuit in generative computer vision with widespread applications in film-making, video games, AR/VR, and human-robot interaction. Current methods mainly utilize either diffusion-based generative models or autoregressive models for text-to-motion generation. However, they face two significant challenges: (1) The generation process is time-consuming, posing a major obstacle for real-time applications such as gaming, robot manipulation, and other online settings. (2) These methods typically learn a relative motion representation guided by text, making it difficult to generate motion sequences with precise joint-level control. These challenges significantly hinder progress and limit the real-world application of human motion generation techniques. To address this gap, we propose a simple yet effective architecture consisting of two key components. Firstly, we aim to improve hardware efficiency and computational complexity in transformer-based diffusion models for human motion generation. By customizing flash linear attention, we can optimize these models specifically for generating human motion efficiently. Furthermore, we will customize the consistency model in the motion latent space to further accelerate motion generation. Secondly, we introduce Motion ControlNet, which enables more precise joint-level control of human motion compared to previous text-to-motion generation methods. These contributions represent a significant advancement for text-to-motion generation, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

Enhanced hardware efficiency and computational complexity through the use of customized flash linear attention in transformer-based diffusion models, aimed specifically at improving human motion generation speed and efficiency. 2. The introduction of Motion ControlNet, which provides a mechanism for more accurate joint-level control in the generated motion, enhancing the specificity and utility of motion sequences. The proposed solutions represent significant steps forward in making text-to-motion generation more applicable for real-time scenarios. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The contributions of this paper are noteworthy as they directly address significant pain points in the field of motion generation—efficiency and control. The integration of flash linear attention with transformer models can significantly reduce generation times, which is vital for real-time applications.

This dual approach of enhancing both efficiency and controllability could set a new benchmark for future research. However, the paper does not delve deeply into experimental validation or comparative assessments with existing methods. While the proposed architecture is promising, the effectiveness of its components remains to be critically evaluated against established benchmarks in the field. Moreover, the abstract lacks specific metrics or results indicating how much of a performance gain is achieved over state-of-the-art methods, which raises questions about the practical implications of the research. **Strengths:** - Addresses real-world challenges in motion generation. - Proposes innovative solutions that enhance efficiency and control, which are pivotal for applications in AR/VR and robotics. - The method combines advancements in model efficiency with enhanced control mechanisms, making it a comprehensive approach. **Weaknesses:** - Lack of detailed experimental validation and comparison with existing methods in the abstract. - Potential over-reliance on theoretical advancements without robust empirical support. - May require further clarification on the applicability and integration of proposed methods in various practical scenarios.

- **Authors**: Zhe Wang, Yuhua Ru, Fabian Bauer, Aladine Chetouani, Fang Chen, Liping Zhang, Didier Hans, Rachid Jennane, Mohamed Jarraya, Yung Hsin Chen
- **Abstract**: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers critical insights into microstructural details, however, the spatial resolution of standard 1.5T imaging systems is often limited. In contrast, 7T MRI provides significantly enhanced spatial resolution, enabling finer visualization of anatomical structures. Though this, the high cost and limited availability of 7T MRI hinder its widespread use in clinical settings. To address this challenge, a novel Super-Resolution (SR) model is proposed to generate 7T-like MRI from standard 1.5T MRI scans. Our approach leverages a diffusion-based architecture, incorporating gradient nonlinearity correction and bias field correction data from 7T imaging as guidance. Moreover, to improve deployability, a progressive distillation strategy is introduced. Specifically, the student model refines the 7T SR task with steps, leveraging feature maps from the inference phase of the teacher model as guidance, aiming to allow the student model to achieve progressively 7T SR performance with a smaller, deployable model size. Experimental results demonstrate that our baseline teacher model achieves state-of-the-art SR performance. The student model, while lightweight, sacrifices minimal performance. Furthermore, the student model is capable of accepting MRI inputs at varying resolutions without the need for retraining, significantly further enhancing deployment flexibility. The clinical relevance of our proposed method is validated using clinical data from Massachusetts General Hospital. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZWang78/SR.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel super-resolution (SR) model aimed at enhancing the spatial resolution of 1.5T MRI scans to levels comparable to 7T MRI, which, despite its superior imaging capabilities, is limited in clinical use due to cost and availability. The proposed method utilizes a diffusion-based architecture that integrates gradient nonlinearity correction and bias field correction derived from 7T images to guide the super-resolution process. To improve the model's practicality, a progressive distillation strategy is introduced, allowing a smaller, more deployable student model to achieve high SR performance by incrementally refining its outputs based on the teacher model's feature maps. The results indicate that while the student model is lightweight, it maintains near-state-of-the-art performance with the added benefit of being adaptable to MRI inputs at diverse resolutions, enhancing its clinical usability. The approach's effectiveness is validated with clinical data from Massachusetts General Hospital and code implementation is made publicly accessible. ### Evaluation **Novelty:** The proposed method demonstrates a significant degree of innovation by addressing a well-recognized challenge in medical imaging: enhancing the resolution of common 1.5T MRI systems using advanced computational techniques. The integration of diffusion-based architecture with targeted corrections from 7T MRI sets a new standard for SR in this context. The introduction of progressive distillation, which refines a smaller model while still achieving high performance, is particularly noteworthy for its potential to streamline clinical applications. **Significance:** The significance of this paper lies in its practical implications for improving MRI imaging capabilities without the need for costly equipment upgrades. By producing high-resolution images from existing 1.5T scans, the research could enhance diagnostic accuracy and expand access to advanced imaging techniques in various clinical settings. The collaborative validation with a reputable clinical institution enhances the credibility of the findings. **Strengths:** - The approach combines advanced AI methodologies with clinically relevant problems, helping to bridge the gap between research and healthcare. - The use of clinical data for validation and the release of code for replication further support its impact on the field. **Weaknesses:** - The paper may lack a thorough evaluation of potential limitations in the model's performance across a wider range of pathologies or in diverse demographic populations. - The scalability of this method in actual clinical workflows and its integration with existing imaging practices are not deeply explored. Given the paper's compelling solution to a significant problem in medical imaging, its innovative approach, and practical implications in clinical settings, it presents a strong contribution to the field of MRI super-resolution. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s solid novelty and significance while acknowledging areas for deeper exploration and validation, which could further enhance its impact within the research community.

- **Abstract**: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of student models have leveraged LLMs to analyze textual artifacts generated by students to understand and evaluate their learning. These student models typically employ pre-trained LLMs to vectorize text inputs into embeddings and then use the embeddings to train models to detect the presence or absence of a construct of interest. However, how reliable and robust are these models at processing language with different levels of complexity? In the context of learning where students may have different language backgrounds with various levels of writing skills, it is critical to examine the robustness of such models to ensure that these models work equally well for text with varying levels of language complexity. Coincidentally, a few (but limited) research studies show that the use of language can indeed impact the performance of LLMs. As such, in the current study, we examined the robustness of several LLM-based student models that detect student self-regulated learning (SRL) in math problem-solving. Specifically, we compared how the performance of these models vary using texts with high and low lexical, syntactic, and semantic complexity measured by three linguistic measures.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the robustness of large language models (LLMs) employed in student models that analyze textual artifacts for self-regulated learning (SRL) in math problem-solving. It highlights the importance of these models performing reliably across varying levels of language complexity, particularly as different students present diverse writing skills and backgrounds. The study focuses on a comparative analysis of LLMs' performance when processing texts categorized by high and low lexical, syntactic, and semantic complexity. It finds that language complexity can indeed influence the efficacy of LLM interpretations, thus raising significant questions about the applicability and fairness of these models in educational settings. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper addresses a relevant gap in the existing literature by specifically focusing on the robustness of LLM-based student models against linguistic complexity, an area that has received limited attention. This is a notable contribution as it ties the performance of LLMs directly to practical educational implications, particularly in adaptive learning strategies. **Significance:** The findings have pivotal implications for educators and researchers relying on LLMs for text analysis in varied academic contexts. It highlights that models may not uniformly function across different student populations, thereby advocating for a more nuanced approach in the utilization of LLMs in educational technology. **Strengths:**  1. The study employs systematic linguistic measures to evaluate complexity, which adds methodological rigor. 2. It brings forth the critical issue of fairness and equity in educational assessments driven by AI, encouraging the development of more robust models. **Weaknesses:**  1. The abstract mentions limited prior studies but does not detail these works, which could provide additional context for its contributions. 2. The actual extent of robustness and the specific impacts on educational outcomes might require further exploration, as the implications presented could benefit from more extensive empirical validation. **Overall Assessment:** The paper makes a substantial contribution to understanding the interaction between LLMs and language complexity in educational contexts. While there are areas for deeper exploration, the relevance of the topic and the insights provided position the research as a meaningful advancement in the field. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Alexander Tuisov, Yonatan Vernik, Alexander Shleyfman
- **Abstract**: Domain-independent heuristics have long been a cornerstone of AI planning, offering general solutions applicable across a wide range of tasks without requiring domain-specific engineering. However, the advent of large language models (LLMs) presents an opportunity to generate heuristics tailored to specific planning problems, potentially challenging the necessity of domain independence as a strict design principle. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to automatically derive planning heuristics from task descriptions represented as successor generators and goal tests written in general purpose programming language. We investigate the trade-offs between domain-specific LLM-generated heuristics and traditional domain-independent methods in terms of computational efficiency and explainability. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can create heuristics that achieve state-of-the-art performance on some standard IPC domains, as well as their ability to solve problems that lack an adequate Planning Domain Definition Language ({\sc pddl}) representation. We discuss whether these results signify a paradigm shift and how they can complement existing approaches.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "LLM-Generated Heuristics for AI Planning: Do We Even Need Domain-Independence Anymore?" examines the potential of large language models (LLMs) in generating heuristics for AI planning tasks that may obviate the necessity of traditional domain-independent heuristics. It argues that LLMs can create problem-specific heuristics based on general programming language representations of task descriptions, thereby offering a more tailored approach to solving planning problems. The authors conduct experiments comparing the computational efficiency and explainability of LLM-generated heuristics against traditional domain-independent methods. The results suggest that LLMs can produce heuristics that not only achieve state-of-the-art results in standard IPC domains but also handle problems lacking suitable PDDL representations. The paper explores whether this indicates a shift in strategy for designing heuristics in AI planning and discusses how LLMs might complement existing approaches. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The study presents a novel application of LLM technology within AI planning, an area that has traditionally relied on domain-independent strategies. This shift could lead to more efficient and problem-specific heuristics. 2. **Experiments and Results:** The empirical evidence demonstrating LLM-generated heuristics achieving state-of-the-art performance adds credibility to the claims made. The ability to solve problems outside traditional PDDL frameworks is particularly noteworthy. 3. **Relevance to Current Trends:** The paper addresses a contemporary issue in AI, discussing the implications of LLMs' capabilities and their potential role in reshaping heuristic design. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Discussion of Trade-offs:** While the paper mentions the trade-offs related to domain-specific versus domain-independent heuristics, it lacks a deep exploration of the limitations and potential drawbacks of using LLM-generated heuristics, such as training data biases or generalization failures. 2. **Dependence on LLM Quality:** The effectiveness of the proposed heuristics hinges significantly on the underlying capabilities of LLMs, which can vary in quality. Hence, the results obtained may not be consistently replicable across different models or configurations. 3. **Future Directions:** The discussion regarding future implications and research directions could be more robust. The paper touches on whether domain-independence is necessary, but it would benefit from a more detailed examination of the practical impacts of integrated approaches. **Impact and Influence:** This paper has the potential to influence future research in AI planning by challenging long-standing principles while introducing innovative methodologies. If LLM-generated heuristics can consistently outperform traditional methods, they may lead to a reevaluation of how heuristic functions are developed across different planning domains. **Score: 8**   The paper presents a significant advancement in the application of LLMs within AI planning, proposing a compelling alternative to established heuristic generation methods. It demonstrates empirical success and encourages a rethinking of design principles. However, its exploration of trade-offs and limitations could be strengthened, preventing it from reaching the highest levels of novelty and impact. There are promising avenues for further investigation that this initial study opens up.

- **Authors**: Kelvin Kan, Xingjian Li, Stanley Osher
- **Abstract**: Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in numerous tasks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time formulation of transformers. Specifically, we consider a dynamical system whose governing equation is parametrized by transformer blocks. We leverage optimal transport theory to regularize the training problem, which enhances stability in training and improves generalization of the resulting model. Moreover, we demonstrate in theory that this regularization is necessary as it promotes uniqueness and regularity of solutions. Our model is flexible in that almost any existing transformer architectures can be adopted to construct the dynamical system with only slight modifications to the existing code. We perform extensive numerical experiments on tasks motivated by natural language processing, image classification, and point cloud classification. Our experimental results show that the proposed method improves the performance of its discrete counterpart and outperforms relevant comparing models.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces the OT-Transformer, a novel transformer architecture that operates in a continuous-time framework, governed by a dynamical system defined by transformer blocks. By integrating optimal transport theory as a regularization tool, the authors aim to enhance the stability and generalization capacity of the model during training. The theoretical contributions include proofs showing that this regularization is essential for attaining unique and well-posed solutions. The model exhibits versatility, allowing for adaptations of existing transformer architectures with minimal code adjustments. The authors validate their approach through various numerical experiments across natural language processing tasks, image classification, and point cloud classification, demonstrating that the OT-Transformer consistently outperforms traditional transformer models and other comparative architectures. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The introduction of a continuous-time representation of transformers is a significant innovation, as it diverges from the traditionally discrete-time formulations. The application of optimal transport theory for model regularization is relatively novel, allowing for enhanced training stability and improved solution characteristics. This integration has not been extensively explored in the context of transformers, suggesting an original approach that could inspire future research. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The authors provide a solid theoretical underpinning, ensuring that the proposed regularization promotes uniqueness in solutions, which is crucial in many machine learning applications. 2. **Flexibility:** The ability to adapt existing architectures with minor changes enhances the practicality of this approach, encouraging adoption by researchers entrenched in traditional models. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experiments across diverse domains showcase the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model, emphasizing its superior performance compared to established methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** While the introduction of a continuous-time approach adds theoretical depth, it may also introduce complexity in implementation, which could deter practitioners less familiar with dynamical systems and optimal transport theory. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper claims improved performance against discrete counterparts, further comparative analysis with a wider array of state-of-the-art models would strengthen the claims, particularly in marginal improvements or specific use cases. 3. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the authors claim flexibility, there remains a concern about how universally applicable their modifications are to varying architectures. The paper could benefit from elaborating on specific examples. **Potential Influence:** The novel integration of continuous-time dynamics with optimal transport theory has the potential to open new avenues of research in transformer architectures and regularization techniques. If further experiments confirm the authors’ findings across additional tasks or datasets, this work could significantly influence the design of future transformer models. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's solid theoretical contributions and practical implications within the machine learning field. While there are areas for improvement in breadth of comparison and clarity of application, the originality and empirical validation of the proposed method underscore its importance and potential impact on future research and applications.

- **Abstract**: Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted diagnostics and therapies.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Survey and Improvement Strategies for Gene Prioritization with Large Language Models" addresses the diagnostic challenges posed by rare diseases, often exacerbated by the limited patient data and genetic variability. The authors benchmarked various large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4, for their effectiveness in prioritizing causal genes for rare genetic diseases. They employed a classification system based on phenotypes and solvability, utilizing multi-agent approaches and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to manage the complexities of gene prioritization. Their findings indicated that while GPT-4 performed leadingly with nearly 30% accuracy, LLM efficacy decreased as gene set sizes increased. The authors introduced a divide-and-conquer strategy to break down the complexity of the task, resulting in enhanced accuracy and reduced biases related to well-studied genes and input order. This research improved gene identification strategies, thereby offering a potential framework for diagnosing unsolved rare disease cases and advancing targeted diagnostics and therapies. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents noteworthy advancements in the application of large language models to the domain of genetic disease diagnosis, an area that has historically lacked nuanced solutions. By benchmarking various LLMs, the authors provide a systematic evaluation that is currently lacking in the literature, thus filling a significant gap.  One of the key strengths of this work is its innovative use of the divide-and-conquer technique, which is essential given the observed performance drop in LLMs as gene datasets scale. This approach not only enhances accuracy but also mitigates issues of bias, which is particularly pertinent in genetic research dominated by certain well-characterized genes. Additionally, the integration of the Human Phenotype Ontology classification into the gene prioritization process is a meaningful contribution, demonstrating the potential for structured, phenotype-driven classification in complex diagnostic tasks. However, there are some limitations that should be noted. The performance metric of nearly 30% accuracy, while noteworthy, still highlights the need for improvement. Furthermore, the potential for biases inherent in training data and LLMs themselves might not be fully addressed, as it raises questions about the generalizability and fairness of the findings across diverse genetic contexts. Additionally, the manuscript could have provided more detail on the exact methodologies used in classifying patients and gene prioritization, which would enhance reproducibility and allow for critical assessment by peers. Overall, while the paper introduces valuable insights and innovative methodologies, it also reflects the ongoing challenges in rare disease diagnostics. The findings have implications for future research and applications in clinical genetics, paving the way for improved diagnostic efforts for rare diseases.  **Score: 8**  ### Rationale: This score reflects strong novelty and significant implications of the research, highlighting advancements in a critical area of biomedicine through the use of advanced computational methods. However, the limitations in achieving higher accuracy and the need to address inherent biases suggest that while impactful, there is room for further development and research in this domain before it can be regarded as a transformative contribution.

- **Authors**: Bowen Yang, Bharat Venkitesh, Dwarak Talupuru, Hangyu Lin, David Cairuz, Phil Blunsom, Acyr Locatelli
- **Abstract**: Long-context large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements, driven by techniques like Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et al., 2023) and its extensions (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Peng et al., 2023). By adjusting RoPE parameters and incorporating training data with extended contexts, we can train performant models with considerably longer input sequences. However, existing RoPE-based methods exhibit performance limitations when applied to extended context lengths. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various attention mechanisms, including RoPE, No Positional Embedding (NoPE), and Query-Key Normalization (QK-Norm), identifying their strengths and shortcomings in long-context modeling. Our investigation identifies distinctive attention patterns in these methods and highlights their impact on long-context performance, providing valuable insights for architectural design. Building on these findings, we propose a novel architectural based on a hybrid attention mechanism that not only surpasses conventional RoPE-based transformer models in long context tasks but also achieves competitive performance on benchmarks requiring shorter context lengths.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Rope to Nope and Back Again: A New Hybrid Attention Strategy" addresses the limitations of existing methods for long-context modeling in large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). While RoPE has contributed to advancements in processing longer input sequences, this study identifies its drawbacks when scaling to extended context lengths. The authors analyze multiple attention mechanisms, including RoPE, No Positional Embedding (NoPE), and Query-Key Normalization (QK-Norm), assessing their strengths and weaknesses in handling long contexts. Based on their findings, the authors introduce a novel hybrid attention mechanism that improves performance in long-context tasks and maintains competitive results in benchmarks favoring shorter contexts.  **Critical Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates significant novelty in the landscape of attention mechanisms for LLMs by systematically analyzing and comparing various strategies for long-context modeling. One of its primary strengths is the comprehensive evaluation of existing methods and the clear exposition of their limitations, which provides the community with valuable insights. The introduction of a hybrid attention mechanism that enhances performance across both long and short contexts is a meaningful contribution, as existing models tend to specialize in one or the other. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The empirical evaluations could benefit from a more extensive set of benchmarks or tasks to validate the robustness of the proposed hybrid mechanism. Additionally, while the theoretical analysis is insightful, it may have been strengthened by incorporating more detailed experiments or illustrations of how the attention patterns manifest in real data, which would enhance the reader's understanding of its practical implications. In terms of significance, the paper positions itself within a rapidly evolving area of research with growing importance as LLMs continue to be leveraged for diverse applications. The proposed advancements in hybrid attention strategies could influence future architectural designs and methodologies in the field, leading to more efficient and effective models. Given these evaluations, the paper is recognized for its innovative approach and contribution to addressing a key challenge in LLMs.  However, the room for improvement in experimental rigor and illustration of concepts prevents it from being classified as an exceptional or groundbreaking piece. **Score: 7**

### Large Language Models as Common-Sense Heuristics
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18816v1)
- **Authors**: Andrey Borro, Patricia J Riddle, Michael W Barley, Michael J Witbrock
- **Abstract**: While systems designed for solving planning tasks vastly outperform Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain, they usually discard the rich semantic information embedded within task descriptions. In contrast, LLMs possess parametrised knowledge across a wide range of topics, enabling them to leverage the natural language descriptions of planning tasks in their solutions. However, current research in this direction faces challenges in generating correct and executable plans. Furthermore, these approaches depend on the LLM to output solutions in an intermediate language, which must be translated into the representation language of the planning task. We introduce a novel planning method, which leverages the parametrised knowledge of LLMs by using their output as a heuristic for Hill-Climbing Search. This approach is further enhanced by prompting the LLM to generate a solution estimate to guide the search. Our method outperforms the task success rate of similar systems within a common household environment by 22 percentage points, with consistently executable plans. All actions are encoded in their original representation, demonstrating that strong results can be achieved without an intermediate language, thus eliminating the need for a translation step.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents a novel method that utilizes the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as heuristics in planning tasks, specifically within a common household context. Unlike traditional planning systems, which excel in execution but overlook the semantic richness of natural language task descriptions, this approach integrates the latent knowledge of LLMs to enhance planning efficiency. The proposed method employs a Hill-Climbing Search algorithm that uses LLM outputs as heuristic guidance and also prompts the model for solution estimates to improve the search. This innovation results in a significant increase (22 percentage points) in task success rates compared to existing systems, and it generates consistently executable plans without requiring an intermediate language for translation. **Evaluation**:  1. **Novelty**: The paper introduces a fresh perspective on integrating LLMs into planning tasks by framing their outputs as heuristic suggestions, which is a departure from traditional methods that rely heavily on structured representations. This novel application speaks to the evolving landscape of AI planning and shows that leveraging natural language processing can yield practical results without sacrificing execution quality. 2. **Significance**: The findings have practical implications, especially for environments that require intelligent planning capabilities, such as robotics in domestic settings. The 22 percentage point improvement in success rates is notable, highlighting the utility of LLMs in real-world applications.  3. **Strengths**:    - The approach effectively demonstrates that LLMs can enhance planning tasks without the complexity of intermediate languages, thus simplifying the overall process.    - Empirical results showing a substantial improvement add credibility to the claims made about the method's efficacy. 4. **Weaknesses**:    - The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with a wider range of existing planning systems to contextualize its significance fully.    - Potential limitations regarding the scalability of this method to more complex or variable task environments are not thoroughly explored.    - Details about the specific types of planning tasks tested and how representative they are of broader applications would strengthen its claim of generalizability. 5. **Influence**: This work paves the way for further research into the intersection of LLMs and planning, encouraging a trend towards more versatile and semantically aware AI systems.  Based on the assessment of its novelty, significance, strengths, and weaknesses, the paper deserves a high score for its innovative approach and practical contributions to the field. However, some shortcomings in the depth of analysis and limitations discussed necessitate a slightly tempered rating. **Score: 8**

### Bridging the Reasoning Gap: Small LLMs Can Plan with Generalised Strategies
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18817v1)
- **Authors**: Andrey Borro, Patricia J Riddle, Michael W Barley, Michael J Witbrock
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in the reasoning skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an increase in the ability of LLMs to solve simple planning tasks. However, as long as the driving force behind improved reasoning capability is the size and complexity of the model, the financial and computational costs associated with running them will also increase. This trend raises questions about continued accessibility and whether these improvements will increase at the same pace as models continue to grow in size and expense. We propose two approaches to enhance the reasoning ability of less resource-intensive LLMs. (1) Provide them with a generalised strategy for solving tasks within a given domain, generated by a more resource-intensive LLM. (2) Exploit their cost-effectiveness by iteratively prompting these models to correct errors in their proposed solutions. Our empirical results from planning and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that these methods improve the performance of less resource-intensive LLMs to levels comparable with their more resource-intensive counterparts, at a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we show that the utilisation of generalised strategies in our experiments reduced the cost of the less resource-intensive model by nearly 30 percent on average.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Bridging the Reasoning Gap: Small LLMs Can Plan with Generalised Strategies" discusses recent improvements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the associated challenges regarding their accessibility due to high costs linked to larger models. The authors propose two strategies for enhancing the reasoning abilities of smaller, less resource-intensive LLMs. The first approach utilizes a generalized strategy generated by a larger model to assist the smaller ones in solving specific domain tasks. The second strategy involves an iterative prompting method that helps smaller models correct errors in their outputs. Empirical results indicate that these methods significantly elevate the performance of smaller models to levels near those of their larger counterparts, achieving an average cost reduction of approximately 30%. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper brings a substantial contribution to the field by addressing a pressing issue regarding the scalability and accessibility of LLMs. Its approach to enhancing the capabilities of smaller models through generalized strategies and iterative corrections is innovative and represents a significant shift in research focus from solely improving large models to optimizing smaller ones.  **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Solutions:** The strategies proposed are practical and have the potential to make advanced reasoning capabilities more accessible to researchers and developers with limited resources. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The inclusion of empirical results strengthens the paper, providing concrete evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed methods. 3. **Cost-Efficiency Focus:** Highlighting cost reductions is essential in the context of AI research, especially as computational expenses continue to grow. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** While the methods demonstrated effectiveness in planning and mathematical reasoning, the generalizability of these results to other domains and more complex reasoning tasks remains to be fully investigated. 2. **Dependency on Larger Models:** The first proposed method relies heavily on the capabilities of larger models, which could limit its applicability in scenarios where such resources are not available. 3. **Technical Depth:** Some areas could benefit from deeper technical exploration of how generalized strategies are generated and how iteration affects the reasoning process. Overall, while the work is novel and offers significant implications for making LLMs more accessible and efficient, some of its methodologies and experimental validations need broader scope and deeper investigation to fully ascertain their robustness. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovation and practical implications, balanced by a need for further examination of its broader applications and the dependence on large models for generating generalized strategies.

### Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Transformers via Token Selection
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18824v1)
- **Authors**: Antoine Simoulin, Namyong Park, Xiaoyi Liu, Grey Yang
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning provides an effective means to specialize pre-trained models for various downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning often incurs high memory overhead, especially for large transformer-based models, such as LLMs. While existing methods may reduce certain parts of the memory required for fine-tuning, they still require caching all intermediate activations computed in the forward pass to update weights during the backward pass. In this work, we develop TokenTune, a method to reduce memory usage, specifically the memory to store intermediate activations, in the fine-tuning of transformer-based models. During the backward pass, TokenTune approximates the gradient computation by backpropagating through just a subset of input tokens. Thus, with TokenTune, only a subset of intermediate activations are cached during the forward pass. Also, TokenTune can be easily combined with existing methods like LoRA, further reducing the memory cost. We evaluate our approach on pre-trained transformer models with up to billions of parameters, considering the performance on multiple downstream tasks such as text classification and question answering in a few-shot learning setup. Overall, TokenTune achieves performance on par with full fine-tuning or representative memory-efficient fine-tuning methods, while greatly reducing the memory footprint, especially when combined with other methods with complementary memory reduction mechanisms. We hope that our approach will facilitate the fine-tuning of large transformers, in specializing them for specific domains or co-training them with other neural components from a larger system. Our code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/tokentune.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents TokenTune, a novel method aimed at reducing memory overhead during the fine-tuning of large transformer-based models. Traditional fine-tuning methods necessitate caching all intermediate activations during the forward pass for gradient computation in the backward pass, leading to high memory usage. TokenTune addresses this challenge by approximating gradient computation via selective backpropagation through a subset of input tokens, thereby allowing for the caching of only necessary intermediate activations. This method is compatible with existing techniques like LoRA, further enhancing memory efficiency. Evaluations demonstrating TokenTune's effectiveness were conducted on pre-trained models across various downstream tasks, such as text classification and question answering. The results indicate that TokenTune achieves performance comparable to both full fine-tuning and other established memory-efficient approaches, particularly when combined with them. The framework aims to facilitate the fine-tuning of large transformers for specialized tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of machine learning, specifically in the fine-tuning of transformer models, by offering a solution to the substantial memory requirements that typically characterize this process.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of selective token backpropagation represents a thoughtful and innovative way to alleviate memory challenges, which is a prevalent bottleneck in the deployment of large models. 2. **Compatibility with Existing Methods:** The ability to combine TokenTune with established methods like LoRA suggests practical applications that could enhance overall efficiency, promising future research directions and adaptability. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The evaluation on tasks such as text classification and question answering is robust, showcasing the method's effectiveness and practicality. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper could benefit from a more detailed theoretical grounding on why selective backpropagation retains sufficient gradient information, potentially leaving gaps in understanding the limits of this approach. 2. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising, further studies on additional tasks or models would strengthen claims about generalizability beyond a few selected tasks. 3. **Comparative Analysis:** More extensive comparisons with a wider range of memory-efficient tuning techniques could provide better insights into the relative performance and uniqueness of TokenTune. **Overall Impact:** Overall, TokenTune has the potential to influence practices in fine-tuning large transformer models, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Its core idea of reducing memory overhead while maintaining performance is both timely and relevant, considering the growing size of pre-trained models. Considering these aspects, I would assign a **Score: 8**. This score reflects a strong yet not unparalleled improvement to current methodologies. The novelty and significance are evident, but the paper could benefit from additional theoretical backing and broad evaluations to secure a higher assessment.

### Pitfalls of defacing whole-head MRI: re-identification risk with diffusion models and compromised research potential

- **Abstract**: Defacing is often applied to head magnetic resonance image (MRI) datasets prior to public release to address privacy concerns. The alteration of facial and nearby voxels has provoked discussions about the true capability of these techniques to ensure privacy as well as their impact on downstream tasks. With advancements in deep generative models, the extent to which defacing can protect privacy is uncertain. Additionally, while the altered voxels are known to contain valuable anatomical information, their potential to support research beyond the anatomical regions directly affected by defacing remains uncertain. To evaluate these considerations, we develop a refacing pipeline that recovers faces in defaced head MRIs using cascaded diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). The DPMs are trained on images from 180 subjects and tested on images from 484 unseen subjects, 469 of whom are from a different dataset. To assess whether the altered voxels in defacing contain universally useful information, we also predict computed tomography (CT)-derived skeletal muscle radiodensity from facial voxels in both defaced and original MRIs. The results show that DPMs can generate high-fidelity faces that resemble the original faces from defaced images, with surface distances to the original faces significantly smaller than those of a population average face (p < 0.05). This performance also generalizes well to previously unseen datasets. For skeletal muscle radiodensity predictions, using defaced images results in significantly weaker Spearman's rank correlation coefficients compared to using original images (p < 10-4). For shin muscle, the correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.05) when using original images but not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when any defacing method is applied, suggesting that defacing might not only fail to protect privacy but also eliminate valuable information.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the effectiveness of defacing techniques applied to whole-head MRI scans as a means to protect privacy against potential re-identification risks, particularly in light of advances in deep learning models. The authors introduce a method for recovering faces in defaced MRIs using a pipeline of cascaded diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) trained on a dataset of 180 subjects, and they validate this method on images from 484 unseen subjects. The findings indicate that DPMs can accurately reconstruct high-fidelity faces from defaced images, which raises questions about the effectiveness of defacing as a privacy measure. Furthermore, the paper examines the implications of defacing on the utility of nearby anatomical information by comparing correlations in skeletal muscle radiodensity predictions derived from defaced versus original images. The results demonstrate a significant decline in predictive capability when using defaced images, suggesting that defacing not only fails to address privacy concerns but may also compromise valuable anatomical data essential for research. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy exploration of the current paradigms in MRI privacy protection, especially against a backdrop of rapidly improving machine learning techniques. The use of DPMs to successfully restore identifiable features from defaced images offers a fresh perspective on the limitations of existing defacing methods. By quantitatively demonstrating the negative impact of defacing on anatomical data recovery, this study contributes valuable insights into the socio-ethical aspects of neuroimaging research and public data sharing. **Strengths:** 1. **Timeliness and Relevance:** The topic is highly relevant, considering the increasing sharing of biomedical data and the ethical ramifications associated with privacy. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** The paper employs robust statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques, establishing a clear connection between the defacing process and its consequences on data utility. 3. **Broader Impact:** It opens a dialogue for reforming data-sharing practices to better balance privacy concerns with scientific utility. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** The study's findings are based on specific observables in defaced MRIs and may not generalize to other imaging modalities or datasets without validation. 2. **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper raises critical concerns, it could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on alternative privacy-preserving techniques or greater exploration of the implications of its findings on policy and regulation. Overall, the novelty of the findings and their potential implications for privacy and research make this a significant contribution to the field. However, the paper would be strengthened by addressing the weaknesses noted above. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to universal jailbreaks-prompting strategies that systematically bypass model safeguards and enable users to carry out harmful processes that require many model interactions, like manufacturing illegal substances at scale. To defend against these attacks, we introduce Constitutional Classifiers: safeguards trained on synthetic data, generated by prompting LLMs with natural language rules (i.e., a constitution) specifying permitted and restricted content. In over 3,000 estimated hours of red teaming, no red teamer found a universal jailbreak that could extract information from an early classifier-guarded LLM at a similar level of detail to an unguarded model across most target queries. On automated evaluations, enhanced classifiers demonstrated robust defense against held-out domain-specific jailbreaks. These classifiers also maintain deployment viability, with an absolute 0.38% increase in production-traffic refusals and a 23.7% inference overhead. Our work demonstrates that defending against universal jailbreaks while maintaining practical deployment viability is tractable.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against Universal Jailbreaks across Thousands of Hours of Red Teaming" addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to universal jailbreaks, which are strategies designed to circumvent the models’ built-in safeguards, enabling harmful activities like the large-scale production of illegal substances. The authors propose a novel defensive mechanism called **Constitutional Classifiers**, which are trained on synthetic data derived from LLMs through natural language prompts that define rules for permissible and restricted content. Over an extensive evaluation period of approximately 3,000 hours of red teaming, the study found no successful universal jailbreak attempts that matched the detail retrieval capabilities of unguarded models. The classifiers also showed effectiveness against domain-specific jailbreaks during automated testing. Furthermore, the classifiers exhibited acceptable deployment characteristics, with only a slight increase in refusal rates (0.38%) and an inference overhead of 23.7%. The findings assert that it is feasible to defend against universal jailbreaks while preserving practical deployment. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance #### Strengths: 1. **Robust Evaluation Framework**: The incorporation of an extensive red teaming phase (over 3,000 hours) lends credibility to the findings and emphasizes the thoroughness of the testing process, showcasing a strong practical approach to model safety. 2. **Novelty of Constitutional Classifiers**: The introduction of classifiers based on a defined set of natural language rules is a novel approach in the realm of LLM security. It reflects an innovative shift towards synthesizing structured definitions of allowed behavior, which could influence future defensive methodologies. 3. **Practical Deployment**: The paper successfully addresses the dual challenge of security and practical usability in deployments of LLMs, making it relevant for real-world applications. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the authors claim robust defense capabilities, the paper does not fully explore the range of attack vectors possible in real-world applications, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to all potential scenarios. 2. **Inference Overhead**: Although the slight increase in refusal rates may seem acceptable, a 23.7% inference overhead is significant for production systems, potentially affecting user experience and system performance. 3. **Dependence on Synthetic Data**: The use of synthetic data for training the classifiers raises concerns regarding the model's capacity to handle nuanced and diverse real-world inputs that were not represented in the prompts used to generate the training data. #### Overall Impact: The paper contributes significantly to the field of LLM safety by proposing a systematic and innovative defense against universal jailbreaks. Its focus on maintaining deployment viability while enhancing security sets a benchmark in the ongoing efforts to ensure safer AI interactions. However, the specific nature of the defenses and the reliance on synthetic training data suggest that while the approach is promising, further testing and validation in diverse real-world scenarios will be essential to confirm its effectiveness. ### Score: 8 The score of 8 reflects a strong contribution to the field with innovative approaches and practical implications, albeit with some limitations that could impact its broader applicability and performance in varied real-world contexts. The findings are significant enough to influence ongoing research and development in the area of AI safety.

- **Authors**: Wojciech Zaremba, Evgenia Nitishinskaya, Boaz Barak, Stephanie Lin, Sam Toyer, Yaodong Yu, Rachel Dias, Eric Wallace, Kai Xiao, Johannes Heidecke, Amelia Glaese
- **Abstract**: We conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows. We perform no adversarial training for the tasks we study, and we increase inference-time compute by simply allowing the models to spend more compute on reasoning, independently of the form of attack. Our results suggest that inference-time compute has the potential to improve adversarial robustness for Large Language Models. We also explore new attacks directed at reasoning models, as well as settings where inference-time compute does not improve reliability, and speculate on the reasons for these as well as ways to address them.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Trading Inference-Time Compute for Adversarial Robustness" investigates the relationship between inference-time computational effort and the adversarial robustness of reasoning models, specifically examining OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini models. The authors find that by increasing the computational resources allocated during inference, the models exhibit improved resistance to various adversarial attacks. Notably, they observe a trend where the success rate of attacks diminishes to nearly zero as inference-time compute is increased, with certain exceptions identified. The study emphasizes that no adversarial training was applied to the models under evaluation, and the increase in compute pertains solely to reasoning capabilities. The authors also introduce new targeted attacks on reasoning models, analyze scenarios where inference-time compute does not enhance robustness, and provide insights into potential underlying mechanisms. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Empirical Evidence**: The paper presents empirical findings that demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing the robustness of reasoning models against adversarial attacks without the need for adversarial training. This is a significant contribution as adversarial training often poses challenges in terms of computational cost and practicality. 2. **Investigative Depth**: The authors not only assess the positive impacts of increased inference-time compute but also probe into cases where it fails to provide robustness, opening avenues for further research. 3. **New Attacks**: By formulating new types of adversarial attacks targeted at reasoning models, the paper adds to the understanding of the vulnerabilities within these systems, highlighting the arms race between model robustness and the development of sophisticated adversarial techniques. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the focus on inference-time compute is innovative, the experiments seem constrained to specific models and scenarios. The generalizability of the findings across a broader spectrum of reasoning models remains uncertain. 2. **Lack of Theoretical Insights**: The paper primarily focuses on empirical results without providing a deep theoretical framework that could explain why increased compute leads to improved robustness. This could limit its impact on the theoretical understanding of adversarial defenses. 3. **Exceptions Not Fully Explored**: The authors briefly mention key exceptions where inference-time compute does not enhance robustness but do not delve into detailed analyses. Understanding these exceptions could be critical for developing more robust models. ### Overall Assessment This paper presents significant, actionable findings that show how inference-time compute can enhance the robustness of language models against adversarial attacks—a timely and relevant topic in AI research. Nevertheless, the limitations in scope, lack of theoretical depth, and insufficient exploration of exceptions temper its overall impact.  **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Yaping Chai, Haoran Xie, Joe S. Qin
- **Abstract**: The increasing size and complexity of pre-trained language models have demonstrated superior performance in many applications, but they usually require large training datasets to be adequately trained. Insufficient training sets could unexpectedly make the model overfit and fail to cope with complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) trained on extensive corpora have prominent text generation capabilities, which improve the quality and quantity of data and play a crucial role in data augmentation. Specifically, distinctive prompt templates are given in personalised tasks to guide LLMs in generating the required content. Recent promising retrieval-based techniques further improve the expressive performance of LLMs in data augmentation by introducing external knowledge to enable them to produce more grounded-truth data. This survey provides an in-depth analysis of data augmentation in LLMs, classifying the techniques into Simple Augmentation, Prompt-based Augmentation, Retrieval-based Augmentation and Hybrid Augmentation. We summarise the post-processing approaches in data augmentation, which contributes significantly to refining the augmented data and enabling the model to filter out unfaithful content. Then, we provide the common tasks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we introduce existing challenges and future opportunities that could bring further improvement to data augmentation.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Text Data Augmentation for Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey of Methods, Challenges, and Opportunities" systematically reviews approaches to augmenting text data for training large language models (LLMs). As LLMs are primarily driven by vast amounts of training data, the authors highlight the risks of overfitting arising from insufficient training datasets. They identify and categorize various augmentation techniques into four main types: Simple Augmentation, Prompt-based Augmentation, Retrieval-based Augmentation, and Hybrid Augmentation. The review also addresses post-processing methods that enhance the quality of augmented data and reduce the occurrence of unfaithful content. Additionally, the authors examine relevant tasks and evaluation metrics and discuss existing challenges and potential avenues for future research to advance the field of data augmentation. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents a significant contribution to the field of natural language processing, particularly concerning the training of large language models, by methodically surveying various data augmentation techniques. The classification into distinct categories provides a structured understanding of existing methods which is valuable for researchers and practitioners working in this domain. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensive Overview:** The paper collects a wide range of augmentation techniques and classifies them methodically, presenting a clear framework. 2. **Identification of Challenges:** By discussing the challenges and prospects in data augmentation, the authors highlight gaps in current research and pave the way for future innovations. 3. **Focus on Practical Applications:** The paper connects different augmentation strategies to real-world applications and outlines evaluation metrics, making the review relevant for practitioners. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** While the theoretical discussion is robust, it could be strengthened with more empirical data showing the effectiveness of the various methods outlined. 2. **Limited Novelty in Proposals:** The survey predominantly focuses on existing frameworks without a bold proposal for new methodologies or transformative approaches, which may limit its innovative impact. 3. **Regional Focus:** If most examples are drawn from specific use cases or datasets, it might limit the universal applicability of the insights provided. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper significantly contributes to understanding data augmentation in the context of LLMs and sets a foundation for future research. However, it lacks novel methodological proposals and could benefit from empirical validation of the discussed techniques. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid and comprehensive survey that is valuable, but it is hindered by the lack of new insights or empirical validation, which is essential for a paper aiming to significantly influence the field.

### Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18850v1)
- **Authors**: Yang Liu, Chuan Zhou, Shuai Zhang, Peng Zhang, Xixun Lin, Shirui Pan
- **Abstract**: Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) remains a fundamental challenge with significant implications for the development of new materials and the advancement of various scientific disciplines. Recent developments have shown that generative models, particularly diffusion models, hold great promise for CSP. However, traditional graph-based representations, where atomic bonds are modeled as pairwise graph edges, fail to fully capture the intricate high-order interactions essential for accurately representing crystal structures. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes hypergraphs to represent crystal structures, providing a more expressive abstraction for modeling multi-way atomic interactions. By adopting hypergraphs, we can effectively capture complex high-order relationships and symmetries, such as permutation and periodic translation invariance, which are crucial for characterizing crystal structures. In this work, we propose the \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{H}ypergraph \textbf{Diff}usion Model (\textbf{EH-Diff}), a generative model designed to take advantage of the symmetry-preserving properties of hypergraphs. EH-Diff exploits these features to offer an efficient and accurate method for predicting crystal structures with a strong theoretical justification to preserve invariance properties. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that EH-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art CSP methods with only one sample.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel framework for Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) using Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion (EH-Diff). Traditional graph-based methods for modeling atomic interactions often fall short in accurately representing high-order relationships inherent in crystal structures. By employing hypergraphs, the authors introduce a more expressive model that captures complex atomic interactions and symmetries critical to CSP, such as permutation invariance and periodic translations. The EH-Diff model leverages these hypergraph properties, presenting a generative model that maintains crucial invariance characteristics during crystal structure prediction. Extensive empirical evaluations across four benchmark datasets indicate that EH-Diff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art CSP methods, achieving high accuracy with just a single sample. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  The introduction of hypergraphs into the context of crystal structure prediction is innovative, as it goes beyond conventional pairwise edge representations to accommodate complex multi-way interactions. The authors successfully identify a gap in existing methodologies and propose a solution that is theoretically grounded in the fundamental nature of crystal structures.  **Significance:** The practical implications of the work are notable; improved predictions in the field of materials science can potentially accelerate the discovery of new materials with desirable properties. The authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the approach through comprehensive experimentation, which adds to the model's credibility. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: The use of hypergraphs demonstrates a clear attempt to address limitations of previous approaches and opens new avenues for modeling crystal structures. 2. **Empirical Validation**: Robust experimental results showing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods lend credibility to the theoretical claims. 3. **Theoretical Justification**: The preservation of symmetry and invariance properties in the proposed model is well-articulated, providing a solid foundation for the methodology. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: The introduction of hypergraphs may also introduce computational complexity, which could be a barrier for practical applications in large-scale CSP tasks. Further discussions on scalability and computation time would enhance the evaluation. 2. **Generalizability**: While early results are promising, the paper would benefit from exploring the applicability of EH-Diff to a broader range of materials, especially novel or less common crystal types. **Conclusion:** Overall, while the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of CSP through the introduction of the EH-Diff model and empirical validation of its efficacy, concerns regarding complexity and generalizability could limit its immediate practical application. Nevertheless, the novelty of the framework holds great potential for future research directions and fosters further exploration of hypergraph applications in other scientific domains. Score: 8

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet generating reliable reasoning processes remains a significant challenge. We present a unified probabilistic framework that formalizes LLM reasoning through a novel graphical model incorporating latent thinking processes and evaluation signals. Within this framework, we introduce the Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process (BRiTE) algorithm, which works in two steps. First, it generates high-quality rationales by approximating the optimal thinking process through reinforcement learning, using a novel reward shaping mechanism. Second, it enhances the base LLM by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation with respect to the model's parameters. Theoretically, we demonstrate BRiTE's convergence at a rate of $1/T$ with $T$ representing the number of iterations. Empirical evaluations on math and coding benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance across different base models without requiring human-annotated thinking processes. In addition, BRiTE demonstrates superior performance compared to existing algorithms that bootstrap thinking processes use alternative methods such as rejection sampling, and can even match or exceed the results achieved through supervised fine-tuning with human-annotated data.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces BRiTE (Bootstrapping Reinforced Thinking Process), a probabilistic framework designed to improve reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework employs a novel graphical model that blends latent thinking processes and evaluation signals. The BRiTE algorithm operates in two main phases: (1) it generates high-quality rationales through reinforcement learning with an innovative reward shaping method, and (2) it optimizes the base LLM’s performance by maximizing the joint probability of rationale generation. The authors claim theoretical convergence of BRiTE at a rate of $1/T$ as iterations increase. Empirical tests on math and coding tasks reveal that BRiTE enhances performance across various model bases, outperforming both existing bootstrapping algorithms and even matching the effectiveness of supervised fine-tuning approaches that utilize human-annotated data. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The BRiTE framework presents a noteworthy advancement in the field of LLM reasoning, particularly through its novel approach of integrating reinforcement learning with a graphical model. By focusing on rationales as a key element of reasoning and optimizing the model's parameters for rationale generation, it tackles a significant challenge in model comprehension and performance, adding a valuable dimension to existing techniques. The use of reward shaping stands out as both innovative and practical.  **Strengths:** 1. The two-step process for generating rationales and enhancing LLMs provides a clear framework that is grounded in established machine learning principles, making it both credible and reproducible. 2. The empirical results demonstrating performance improvements across several benchmarks lend strong validation to the proposed method. 3. The theoretical analysis concerning the convergence of the BRiTE algorithm adds a layer of mathematical rigor to the framework, which is vital for its credibility. **Weaknesses:** 1. While the empirical results are promising, more comprehensive experimentation across a wider range of tasks and with various types of LLMs would strengthen the argument for BRiTE's generalizability. 2. The assumption that reinforcement learning with reward shaping can effectively approximate optimal thinking processes may require further exploration and justification, especially in more complex reasoning contexts. 3. The paper makes claims about performance relative to human-annotated tuning that, while impressive, would benefit from a deeper examination of the conditions under which these results hold. **Potential Influence:** BRiTE could have significant implications for researchers and developers interested in LLM advancements, particularly those focused on reasoning capabilities. It may guide future directions in LLM training methodologies and contribute to broader discussions around interpretability and automated reasoning. However, thorough inter-comparative studies with other contemporary methods are needed to solidify its place in the evolving landscape of language models. **Score: 8**   The score reflects strong novelty and significance due to the developed framework's innovative approach and promising empirical results. However, further exploration of its limitations and broader applicability suggests room for refinement, preventing it from achieving an exceptional score.

### REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18865v1)
- **Authors**: Zhengqi Gao, Kaiwen Zha, Tianyuan Zhang, Zihui Xue, Duane S. Boning
- **Abstract**: Guidance techniques are simple yet effective for improving conditional generation in diffusion models. Albeit their empirical success, the practical implementation of guidance diverges significantly from its theoretical motivation. In this paper, we reconcile this discrepancy by replacing the scaled marginal distribution target, which we prove theoretically invalid, with a valid scaled joint distribution objective. Additionally, we show that the established guidance implementations are approximations to the intractable optimal solution under no future foresight constraint. Building on these theoretical insights, we propose rectified gradient guidance (REG), a versatile enhancement designed to boost the performance of existing guidance methods. Experiments on 1D and 2D demonstrate that REG provides a better approximation to the optimal solution than prior guidance techniques, validating the proposed theoretical framework. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks show that incorporating REG consistently improves FID and Inception/CLIP scores across various settings compared to its absence.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "REG: Rectified Gradient Guidance for Conditional Diffusion Models" addresses the discrepancies between theoretical underpinnings and practical implementations of guidance techniques used to enhance conditional generation in diffusion models. The authors critique current methods for depending on a theoretically invalid scaled marginal distribution target and propose a rectified gradient guidance (REG) that focuses on a valid scaled joint distribution objective. They demonstrate that existing guidance approaches are merely approximations to an optimal solution hindered by constraints of future foresight. Empirical tests across 1D and 2D scenarios indicate that REG outperforms previous guidance methods. Results on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation tasks reveal significant improvements in performance metrics like FID and Inception/CLIP scores when REG is employed. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents significant contributions to the field of diffusion models, particularly concerning conditional generation tasks. The critique of existing guidance methods, alluding to their theoretical inadequacies, is a valuable insight that encourages reevaluation of standard practices in the field. The introduction of REG as a versatile enhancement demonstrates not only theoretical improvements but also delivers tangible benefits in empirical settings, which underscores its relevance. However, the novelty could be critiqued due to guidance techniques being a well-explored area. While REG potentially offers advancements, the incremental nature of the contributions may not qualify as groundbreaking within the rapidly changing landscape of generative models. The exploration into valid joint distributions is promising but may still be considered a refinement rather than a revolutionary leap. Additionally, while the experimental results are compelling, a broader set of comparisons against cutting-edge methods could bolster the assertions made about REG's superiority. This could enhance confidence in its generalizability across various tasks and domains. In summary, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the understanding and application of guidance strategies in diffusion models, while also posing questions about theoretical foundations in existing methods. Nonetheless, the contribution can be seen as more of a refinement rather than a transformative shift in the field. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's solid theoretical insights and empirical validation while acknowledging that the advancements, albeit valuable, may not be sufficiently novel to impress as ground-breaking within an active and rapidly evolving field of research. The work is significant and useful but might lack the high novelty levels associated with the most impactful contributions.

### Distorting Embedding Space for Safety: A Defense Mechanism for Adversarially Robust Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18877v1)
- **Authors**: Jaesin Ahn, Heechul Jung
- **Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models show remarkable generation performance following text prompts, but risk generating Not Safe For Work (NSFW) contents from unsafe prompts. Existing approaches, such as prompt filtering or concept unlearning, fail to defend against adversarial attacks while maintaining benign image quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Distorting Embedding Space (DES), a text encoder-based defense mechanism that effectively tackles these issues through innovative embedding space control. DES transforms unsafe embeddings, extracted from a text encoder using unsafe prompts, toward carefully calculated safe embedding regions to prevent unsafe contents generation, while reproducing the original safe embeddings. DES also neutralizes the nudity embedding, extracted using prompt ``nudity", by aligning it with neutral embedding to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks. These methods ensure both robust defense and high-quality image generation. Additionally, DES can be adopted in a plug-and-play manner and requires zero inference overhead, facilitating its deployment. Extensive experiments on diverse attack types, including black-box and white-box scenarios, demonstrate DES's state-of-the-art performance in both defense capability and benign image generation quality. Our model is available at https://github.com/aei13/DES.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper  The paper presents a novel defense mechanism named Distorting Embedding Space (DES) aimed at enhancing the safety of text-to-image diffusion models against the generation of Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content. The existing mitigation strategies, like prompt filtering and concept unlearning, are identified as inadequate when facing adversarial attacks, threatening both content safety and image quality.  The authors propose that DES modifies unsafe embeddings derived from hazardous prompts, redirecting them into predetermined safe embedding regions. This transformation allows for the maintenance of benign image quality while preventing inappropriate content generation. Moreover, DES addresses the specific challenge posed by nudity prompts by transforming the associated embeddings to neutral positions, thereby reinforcing the model's resilience against various adversarial strategies.  One of the notable advantages of DES is its plug-and-play capability, requiring no additional inference overhead, which eases its implementation in existing systems. The empirical results presented in the paper indicate that DES outperforms existing methods across multiple adversarial attack scenarios, both in defense efficacy and in maintaining high-quality image output. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**:  1. **Innovative Approach**: The idea of manipulating the embedding space to mitigate safety issues in text-to-image models is novel and adds to the body of knowledge on adversarial robustness. While embedding manipulation is not entirely unprecedented in machine learning, applying it specifically to the context of diffusion models to counteract NSFW content is a significant development. 2. **Addressing Safety and Quality**: The dual focus on ensuring safety from adversarial prompts while preserving image quality represents a crucial balance that has often been challenging to achieve in previous methodologies.  3. **Efficacy Against Diverse Attacks**: The empirical evidence provided that demonstrates DES's performance across various types of attacks adds robust support to the validity of the proposed method, indicating its applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios. 4. **Practical Deployment**: The ease of implementing DES without any added inference costs makes it a potentially attractive solution for developers and researchers working with diffusion models. This aspect enhances its practical utility. **Strengths**: - Clear articulation of the problem and proposed solution. - Robust experimental validation across different attack scenarios. - Significant implications for safety in AI-generated media. **Weaknesses**: - The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation against a wider range of prompts and contexts, particularly those that may not be directly NSFW. - There is limited discussion on the broader ethical implications of deploying such models and how they interact with user perception and trust. - While performance metrics are provided, comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques could be more rigorously laid out to highlight performance margins more distinctly. **Overall Assessment**:  The paper makes a strong contribution to the field by addressing a critical aspect of safety in AI-generated content. It advances the understanding of how embedding space can be controlled to achieve robustness against adversarial threats while maintaining quality. However, future work could enhance the findings by considering more diverse datasets and contextual evaluations. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contributions and its potential impact on safety mechanisms in AI, while acknowledging the need for broader validation and discussion of ethical implications.

### Can We Predict the Effect of Prompts?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18883v1)
- **Authors**: Jae Yong Lee, Sungmin Kang, Shin Yoo
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are machine learning models that have seen widespread adoption due to their capability of handling previously difficult tasks. LLMs, due to their training, are sensitive to how exactly a question is presented, also known as prompting. However, prompting well is challenging, as it has been difficult to uncover principles behind prompting -- generally, trial-and-error is the most common way of improving prompts, despite its significant computational cost. In this context, we argue it would be useful to perform `predictive prompt analysis', in which an automated technique would perform a quick analysis of a prompt and predict how the LLM would react to it, relative to a goal provided by the user. As a demonstration of the concept, we present Syntactic Prevalence Analyzer (SPA), a predictive prompt analysis approach based on sparse autoencoders (SAEs). SPA accurately predicted how often an LLM would generate target syntactic structures during code synthesis, with up to 0.994 Pearson correlation between the predicted and actual prevalence of the target structure. At the same time, SPA requires only 0.4\% of the time it takes to run the LLM on a benchmark. As LLMs are increasingly used during and integrated into modern software development, our proposed predictive prompt analysis concept has the potential to significantly ease the use of LLMs for both practitioners and researchers.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the challenges of effective prompting for Large Language Models (LLMs), emphasizing that the success of these models is highly dependent on the way prompts are formatted. Recognizing that the current method of improving prompts is largely reliant on trial-and-error, which is computationally expensive, the authors propose a novel approach called predictive prompt analysis. This involves developing an automated tool that can analyze prompts and predict how an LLM will respond, taking user-defined goals into account. The authors introduce the Syntactic Prevalence Analyzer (SPA), a technique based on sparse autoencoders (SAEs). The tool demonstrates high predictive accuracy in identifying the prevalence of specific syntactic structures during code synthesis, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.994 with actual outputs. Furthermore, SPA significantly reduces the analysis time to about 0.4% of what it would take to run the LLM, thereby offering a promising solution to streamline prompt optimization in software development. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper presents a novel concept in the realm of LLM utilization by introducing predictive prompt analysis. The introduction of the Syntactic Prevalence Analyzer (SPA) as a practical tool for preemptive evaluation of prompt effectiveness is significant in addressing the bottleneck posed by the existing trial-and-error approach. This innovative framing and the accompanying methodology contribute fresh perspectives to the field of machine learning and software development, particularly regarding LLM applications. **Significance:** The significance of this paper lies in its potential to improve the efficiency of LLM interactions. By automating the prompt evaluation process, SPA can greatly enhance productivity for both practitioners and researchers—an important consideration as LLMs become more integrated into various domains including software engineering. The reported performance metrics highlight its effectiveness and justify the feasibility of implementing such techniques in practice. **Strengths:**  1. Clear identification of a prevailing challenge in LLM usability. 2. Development of a useful predictive tool (SPA) with robust performance metrics. 3. Potential for significant time savings in the prompt optimization process. **Weaknesses:**  1. The scope of the demonstration seems limited to syntactic structures relevant to code synthesis; broader applicability to other domains or types of prompts could have strengthened the contribution. 2. While the results are promising, the paper could benefit from further validation in diverse scenarios to generalize the findings across various LLMs and applications. 3. The reliance on the accuracy of sparse autoencoders may also raise questions regarding robustness in scenarios with less structured prompts. **Overall Assessment:** The ability to predict LLM responses before executing them represents a meaningful step towards enhancing user interaction with these models. The proposed SPA tool demonstrates strong potential utility, although its current application context is somewhat narrow. With further testing and expansion to other prompting scenarios, this work could notably influence prompt engineering strategies in various branches of AI and software development. Score: 8

### CAAT-EHR: Cross-Attentional Autoregressive Transformer for Multimodal Electronic Health Record Embeddings
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18891v1)
- **Authors**: Mohammad Al Olaimat, Serdar Bozdag
- **Abstract**: Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a comprehensive source of longitudinal patient data, encompassing structured modalities such as laboratory results, imaging data, and vital signs, and unstructured clinical notes. These datasets, after necessary preprocessing to clean and format the data for analysis, often remain in their raw EHR form, representing numerical or categorical values without further transformation into task-agnostic embeddings. While such raw EHR data enables predictive modeling, its reliance on manual feature engineering or downstream task-specific optimization limits its utility for general-purpose applications. Deep learning (DL) techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers, have facilitated predictive tasks like disease progression and diagnosis prediction. However, these methods often struggle to fully exploit the temporal and multimodal dependencies inherent in EHR data due to their reliance on pre-processed but untransformed raw EHR inputs. In this study, we introduce CAAT-EHR, a novel architecture designed to bridge this gap by generating robust, task-agnostic longitudinal embeddings from raw EHR data. CAAT-EHR leverages self- and cross-attention mechanisms in its encoder to integrate temporal and contextual relationships across multiple modalities, transforming the data into enriched embeddings that capture complex dependencies. An autoregressive decoder complements the encoder by predicting future time points data during pre-training, ensuring that the resulting embeddings maintain temporal consistency and alignment. CAAT-EHR eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and enables seamless transferability across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of CAAT-EHR-generated embeddings over pre-processed raw EHR data and other baseline approaches.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents CAAT-EHR, a novel architecture for creating multimodal electronic health record (EHR) embeddings from raw patient data. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods, which mainly rely on manually engineered features and struggle with the intrinsic multimodal and temporal dependencies of EHRs, the authors propose a solution using self- and cross-attention mechanisms to produce task-agnostic embeddings. CAAT-EHR includes an encoder that effectively captures complex relationships across structured and unstructured data, complemented by an autoregressive decoder that maintains temporal alignment by predicting future data points. Through extensive evaluations, the proposed system is shown to outperform traditional pre-processed EHR data and baseline methods, making it a promising tool for broader applications in predictive modeling in healthcare. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** CAAT-EHR is a meaningful advancement over existing EHR embedding approaches primarily for a few reasons.

- **Abstract**: Generative AI (GenAI) models have recently achieved remarkable empirical performance in various applications, however, their evaluations yet lack uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we propose a method to compare two generative models based on an unbiased estimator of their relative performance gap. Statistically, our estimator achieves parametric convergence rate and asymptotic normality, which enables valid inference. Computationally, our method is efficient and can be accelerated by parallel computing and leveraging pre-storing intermediate results. On simulated datasets with known ground truth, we show our approach effectively controls type I error and achieves power comparable with commonly used metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of our method in evaluating diffusion models on real image datasets with statistical confidence.

- **Authors**: Mohammad Jalili Torkamani, Joey NG, Nikita Mehrotra, Mahinthan Chandramohan, Padmanabhan Krishnan, Rahul Purandare
- **Abstract**: Bug triaging for security vulnerabilities is a critical part of software maintenance, ensuring that the most pressing vulnerabilities are addressed promptly to safeguard system integrity and user data. However, the process is resource-intensive and comes with challenges, including classifying software vulnerabilities, assessing their severity, and managing a high volume of bug reports. In this paper, we present CASEY, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (in our case, the GPT model) that automates the identification of Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) of security bugs and assesses their severity. CASEY employs prompt engineering techniques and incorporates contextual information at varying levels of granularity to assist in the bug triaging process. We evaluated CASEY using an augmented version of the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), employing quantitative and qualitative metrics to measure its performance across CWE identification, severity assessment, and their combined analysis. CASEY achieved a CWE identification accuracy of 68%, a severity identification accuracy of 73.6%, and a combined accuracy of 51.2% for identifying both. These results demonstrate the potential of LLMs in identifying CWEs and severity levels, streamlining software vulnerability management, and improving the efficiency of security vulnerability triaging workflows.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Streamlining Security Vulnerability Triage with Large Language Models" introduces CASEY, an innovative system that utilizes Large Language Models (GPT) to automate the identification of Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) and assess the severity of software vulnerabilities. This addresses the resource-intensive challenges associated with bug triaging in software maintenance. The authors implement prompt engineering and contextual information to enhance the triaging process. Evaluation of CASEY on an augmented subset of the National Vulnerability Database indicates it achieved a CWE identification accuracy of 68%, a severity identification accuracy of 73.6%, and a combined accuracy of 51.2% for both tasks. The study highlights the potential of LLMs to improve the efficiency of software vulnerability management and enhance the triaging workflows. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper brings forward a noteworthy application of Large Language Models in the domain of security vulnerability management, which is an important and timely area given the increasing complexity of software systems and the growing number of cybersecurity threats. The integration of LLMs, particularly GPT models, into traditional bug triaging processes represents a significant methodological shift that could reduce the burden on human analysts. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper explores a new frontier in using AI for security vulnerabilities, representing a novel intersection of natural language processing and cybersecurity. 2. **Use of LLMs:** It effectively highlights the practical applicability of advanced AI models in addressing real-world challenges in the field, particularly by automating the identification and assessment process. 3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The use of both quantitative and qualitative measurements provides a comprehensive view of CASEY's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Performance Metrics:** While the reported accuracies (e.g., 68% and 73.6%) are promising, they also leave room for improvement, especially since the combined performance drops to 51.2%. This raises questions about robustness when tasks are coupled. 2. **Generality and Scalability:** The study primarily focuses on a specific dataset from the National Vulnerability Database. Future work should examine the model's performance in more diverse environments and with different types of vulnerabilities to validate its generality. 3. **Contextual Information Handling:** The extent and methods of contextual information incorporation are not deeply discussed, leaving a potential gap in understanding how different contexts impact performance. **Potential Influence on the Field:** The research could influence future work in vulnerability management, potentially leading to more effective automated triaging tools. However, the ambiguities regarding performance on broader datasets and the complexity of the implementation could temper immediate application across various software environments. Taking into account both the strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with innovative ideas and practical steps toward improving vulnerability triage, but it also acknowledges the need for greater comprehensive evaluation and potential improvements in performance metrics. Overall, the research stands out for its implications but needs further validation and refinement for broader implementation. **Score: 7**

### Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18913v1)
- **Authors**: Tongda Xu, Xiyan Cai, Xinjie Zhang, Xingtong Ge, Dailan He, Ming Sun, Jingjing Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Jian Li, Yan Wang
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have been leveraged to address inverse problems without additional training, and Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) (Chung et al., 2022a) is among the most popular approaches. Previous analyses suggest that DPS accomplishes posterior sampling by approximating the conditional score. While in this paper, we demonstrate that the conditional score approximation employed by DPS is not as effective as previously assumed, but rather aligns more closely with the principle of maximizing a posterior (MAP). This assertion is substantiated through an examination of DPS on 512x512 ImageNet images, revealing that: 1) DPS's conditional score estimation significantly diverges from the score of a well-trained conditional diffusion model and is even inferior to the unconditional score; 2) The mean of DPS's conditional score estimation deviates significantly from zero, rendering it an invalid score estimation; 3) DPS generates high-quality samples with significantly lower diversity. In light of the above findings, we posit that DPS more closely resembles MAP than a conditional score estimator, and accordingly propose the following enhancements to DPS: 1) we explicitly maximize the posterior through multi-step gradient ascent and projection; 2) we utilize a light-weighted conditional score estimator trained with only 100 images and 8 GPU hours. Extensive experimental results indicate that these proposed improvements significantly enhance DPS's performance. The source code for these improvements is provided in https://github.com/tongdaxu/Rethinking-Diffusion-Posterior-Sampling-From-Conditional-Score-Estimator-to-Maximizing-a-Posterior.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper titled "Rethinking Diffusion Posterior Sampling: From Conditional Score Estimator to Maximizing a Posterior" critically examines the methodology behind Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS), a technique widely utilized for addressing inverse problems using diffusion models. The authors assert that previous interpretations of DPS as a conditional score estimator are flawed; rather, it aligns more closely with a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) principle. Through empirical evaluations using ImageNet images, they highlight significant deficiencies in DPS's conditional score estimation, pointing out its divergence from expected scores, higher levels of sample quality but reduced diversity, and mean deviation from zero, suggesting invalid estimation. The authors then introduce enhancements to DPS, advocating for the explicit maximization of posterior probabilities and proposing a lightweight conditional score estimator. Experimental results show marked improvements in DPS's performance following these modifications. The source code for these enhancements is made available online. **Evaluation**: In terms of novelty, the paper presents a compelling critique of an established method—DPS—by successfully challenging the common understanding of its functionality. It encourages a reevaluation of traditional frameworks in diffusion models, moving beyond relying solely on conditional score estimations. This shift to emphasize MAP principles introduces a new direction for research in the field. The enhancements proposed are practical and based on empirical evidence, motivating further advancements in sampling techniques. However, while the critique is valid and the proposed modifications show improved performance, one may argue that the extent of innovation may not be groundbreaking but rather represents a refinement of existing methodologies. Additionally, the reliance on a relatively small dataset (100 images) for training the conditional score estimator raises questions about scalability and generalizability in broader applications. Despite these weaknesses, the paper significantly contributes to the discourse on diffusion models, urging future researchers to reconsider foundational assumptions and explore new pathways for advancement.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s importance in advancing the understanding of DPS by challenging prevailing assumptions, as well as its practical contributions, while acknowledging some limitations in the scale of experimentation and the generalizability of the proposed methods.

### LLM Program Optimization via Retrieval Augmented Search
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18916v1)
- **Authors**: Sagnik Anupam, Alexander Shypula, Osbert Bastani
- **Abstract**: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), there has been a great deal of interest in applying them to solve difficult programming tasks. Recent work has demonstrated their potential at program optimization, a key challenge in programming languages research. We propose a blackbox adaptation method called Retrieval Augmented Search (RAS) that performs beam search over candidate optimizations; at each step, it retrieves in-context examples from a given training dataset of slow-fast program pairs to guide the LLM. Critically, we find that performing contextual retrieval based on an LLM-generated natural language description significantly outperforms retrieval based on the source code. In addition, we propose a method called AEGIS for improving interpretability by decomposing training examples into "atomic edits" that are significantly more incremental in nature. We show that RAS performs 1.8$\times$ better than prior state-of-the-art blackbox adaptation strategies, and that AEGIS performs 1.37$\times$ better while performing significantly smaller edits.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "LLM Program Optimization via Retrieval Augmented Search" introduces a novel method for optimizing programs using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a blackbox adaptation technique called Retrieval Augmented Search (RAS), which employs a beam search strategy to discover program optimizations. At each search step, RAS retrieves in-context examples of slow-fast program pairs from a training dataset, based on descriptions generated by the LLM, rather than relying on source code alone. This approach shows improved performance over traditional retrieval methods. Additionally, the authors introduce AEGIS, a technique that enhances interpretability by breaking down training examples into smaller, "atomic edits." The results demonstrate that RAS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 1.8 times, and AEGIS results in a 1.37 times improvement with smaller edits.  ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance This paper presents a substantial advancement in the application of LLMs for program optimization, which has garnered increasing interest in the programming languages research community. The introduction of RAS is particularly noteworthy, as it shifts the paradigm from traditional code-based retrieval to contextual retrieval using natural language descriptions. This shift addresses a critical oversight in prior methods, enhancing the effectiveness of optimization tasks by aligning with how humans conceptualize program behavior. #### Strengths: 1. **Innovation**: The proposal of using an LLM-generated natural language description for contextual retrieval signifies a creative and well-justified approach to program optimization that builds on existing methodologies. 2. **Performance Metrics**: The reported improvements (1.8x for RAS and 1.37x for AEGIS) over previous methods are compelling, suggesting significant advancements in both efficiency and interpretability. 3. **Interpretability**: The AEGIS method addresses a prevalent concern in machine learning and programming; by decomposing changes into atomic edits, it allows for a clearer understanding of the optimization process. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generality**: The paper lacks a discussion on the scalability of RAS across different types or sizes of programming tasks. It's essential to assess whether these methods hold up under various conditions or languages beyond the tested scenarios. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: While improvements over state-of-the-art techniques are shown, a deeper comparative analysis with a broader set of methodologies might provide greater context for the magnitude of these improvements. 3. **Data Dependency**: The reliance on a specific training dataset raises concerns about generalization; it may limit the applicability of RAS and AEGIS to cases where similar slow-fast pairs exist. #### Conclusion: Overall, the paper provides innovative solutions to current challenges in program optimization using LLMs and shows promising results. Nevertheless, a more extensive exploration of limitations and broader applicability would elevate the insights. Hence, I assign a score based on the presented contributions and potential impact on the field while considering the aforementioned strengths and weaknesses. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Haoran Luo, Haihong E, Yikai Guo, Qika Lin, Xiaobao Wu, Xinyu Mu, Wenhao Liu, Meina Song, Yifan Zhu, Luu Anh Tuan
- **Abstract**: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions with a large-scale structured knowledge base (KB). Despite advancements with large language models (LLMs), KBQA still faces challenges in weak KB awareness, imbalance between effectiveness and efficiency, and high reliance on annotated data. To address these challenges, we propose KBQA-o1, a novel agentic KBQA method with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo.
- **Summary**: **Summary** The paper titled "KBQA-o1: Agentic Knowledge Base Question Answering with Monte Carlo Tree Search" presents a new approach to Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), addressing several persistent challenges in the domain, such as weak knowledge base awareness, the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness, and dependency on annotated data. The proposed KBQA-o1 framework integrates a ReAct-based agentic process to facilitate stepwise logical form generation and exploration of the knowledge base environment. It leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for heuristic-driven search, allowing for improved agentic exploration and high-quality annotation generation through incremental fine-tuning. Empirical results demonstrate that KBQA-o1 significantly enhances performance metrics, achieving a GrailQA F1 score of 78.5% with the Llama-3.1-8B model, notably surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method's performance of 48.5% using GPT-3.5-turbo, especially in low-resource contexts.  --- **Evaluation** **Novelty and Significance**:  1. **Innovation**: The introduction of an agentic approach combined with MCTS is notable, as it represents a shift from traditional KBQA frameworks that typically do not account for real-time exploration and decision-making mechanisms in knowledge bases. This offers a fresh perspective on how KBQA systems can dynamically adapt to questions and search spaces, thereby enhancing performance. 2. **Challenges Addressed**: The paper adequately identifies and tackles significant challenges in KBQA, such as weak KB awareness and reliance on high volumes of annotated data. The proposed solutions—agentic exploration and use of MCTS—can potentially lead to broader applications of KBQA technologies in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. 3. **Benchmarking and Performance**: The empirical performance improvements presented in the paper are compelling. The lift in F1 score from 48.5% to 78.5% when tested in a low-resource setting demonstrates substantial effectiveness, and comparison against existing methods strengthens its claims.  However, some weaknesses should be considered: 1. **Generalizability**: While the method shows great promise in improving performance, it has not been tested extensively across various domains or knowledge bases. The paper would benefit from broader evaluations to ensure its general applicability in diverse KB contexts. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The complexity introduced by the agentic approach and MCTS may limit the practical deployment of KBQA-o1 in settings where computational resources or expert knowledge to implement such systems is scarce. 3. **Contextual Limitations**: The paper primarily focuses on a specific use case (GrailQA), and the scalability of its approach to other types of KBQA tasks or datasets remains uncertain.  Despite these limitations, the authors make a significant contribution to the field of KBQA through their novel methodology and the performance gains associated with it. **Score: 8**  In conclusion, while KBQA-o1 is a solid advancement that effectively addresses several foundational concerns in the field of KBQA, its broader applicability and complexity may limit its immediate impact. Nevertheless, it opens up new avenues for research and application, thus making a valuable contribution to the ongoing evolution of question-answering systems.

### Language Games as the Pathway to Artificial Superhuman Intelligence
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18924v1)
- **Authors**: Ying Wen, Ziyu Wan, Shao Zhang
- **Abstract**: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) toward artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI) hinges on data reproduction, a cyclical process in which models generate, curate and retrain on novel data to refine capabilities. Current methods, however, risk getting stuck in a data reproduction trap: optimizing outputs within fixed human-generated distributions in a closed loop leads to stagnation, as models merely recombine existing knowledge rather than explore new frontiers. In this paper, we propose language games as a pathway to expanded data reproduction, breaking this cycle through three mechanisms: (1) \textit{role fluidity}, which enhances data diversity and coverage by enabling multi-agent systems to dynamically shift roles across tasks; (2) \textit{reward variety}, embedding multiple feedback criteria that can drive complex intelligent behaviors; and (3) \textit{rule plasticity}, iteratively evolving interaction constraints to foster learnability, thereby injecting continual novelty. By scaling language games into global sociotechnical ecosystems, human-AI co-evolution generates unbounded data streams that drive open-ended exploration. This framework redefines data reproduction not as a closed loop but as an engine for superhuman intelligence.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper explores the evolution of large language models (LLMs) toward artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI) and identifies a critical challenge in the current approach: the data reproduction trap. This trap occurs when models optimize outputs based on static human-generated distributions, hindering their ability to generate novel insights or data. To overcome this, the authors suggest employing a framework of language games, which incorporate three key mechanisms: (1) **role fluidity**, allowing multi-agent systems to dynamically adjust roles across tasks to enhance data diversity; (2) **reward variety**, which introduces diverse feedback that can instigate complex behaviors; and (3) **rule plasticity**, enabling evolving constraints on interactions to promote continuous learning. By integrating language games into global sociontechnical ecosystems, the authors argue for a model of human-AI co-evolution that generates unbounded streams of data, supporting open-ended exploration and redefining data reproduction as a pathway toward superhuman intelligence. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The proposal of leveraging language games as a dynamic mechanism for enhancing data reproduction is novel. It moves beyond traditional methods that cause stagnation and opens new avenues for exploration in AI development. 2. **Interdisciplinary Perspective:** The integration of concepts from sociotechnical systems into AI development is a significant aspect that could foster collaboration between disciplines and encourage innovative thinking. 3. **Potential for Practical Implementation:** The proposed framework could foster advances in AI, promoting more adaptable and advanced systems that learn more efficiently from diverse interactions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Operationalization Concerns:** The theoretical framework needs further elucidation on how language games will be practically implemented within existing AI systems. This gap may hinder the immediate applicability of the ideas presented. 2. **Empirical Validation:** Without empirical data or experiments to support the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms, the claims may be seen as speculative. The paper could benefit from initial studies or examples demonstrating the implementation of these ideas. 3. **Scalability Issues:** While the authors touch upon scaling language games into global systems, there is a lack of detail on how this scaling can be achieved and what challenges might arise in real-world applications. **Overall Impact:** The ideas laid out in the paper have the potential to significantly influence the trajectory of AI research and development, particularly in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs and facilitating their evolution towards superhuman intelligence. Nevertheless, the paper falls short in areas that would solidify its practicality and immediate relevance in the field. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a balance between the innovative ideas presented and the need for further development and empirical evidence. While the concepts are promising and could lead to a paradigm shift, their realization within practical AI systems remains to be seen, meriting a cautious yet optimistic outlook.

### TabFSBench: Tabular Benchmark for Feature Shifts in Open Environment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18935v1)
- **Authors**: Zi-Jian Cheng, Zi-Yi Jia, Zhi Zhou, Lan-Zhe Guo, Yu-Feng Li
- **Abstract**: Tabular data is widely utilized in various machine learning tasks. Current tabular learning research predominantly focuses on closed environments, while in real-world applications, open environments are often encountered, where distribution and feature shifts occur, leading to significant degradation in model performance. Previous research has primarily concentrated on mitigating distribution shifts, whereas feature shifts, a distinctive and unexplored challenge of tabular data, have garnered limited attention. To this end, this paper conducts the first comprehensive study on feature shifts in tabular data and introduces the first tabular feature-shift benchmark (TabFSBench). TabFSBench evaluates impacts of four distinct feature-shift scenarios on four tabular model categories across various datasets and assesses the performance of large language models (LLMs) and tabular LLMs in the tabular benchmark for the first time. Our study demonstrates three main observations: (1) most tabular models have the limited applicability in feature-shift scenarios; (2) the shifted feature set importance has a linear relationship with model performance degradation; (3) model performance in closed environments correlates with feature-shift performance. Future research direction is also explored for each observation. TabFSBench is released for public access by using a few lines of Python codes at https://github.com/LAMDASZ-ML/TabFSBench.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "TabFSBench: Tabular Benchmark for Feature Shifts in Open Environment" addresses an emerging issue in the analysis of tabular data used in machine learning, particularly in open environments where distribution and feature shifts can drastically impact model performance. While much of the prior research has focused on mitigating distribution shifts, this study uniquely centers on feature shifts, an area that has not received sufficient attention. The authors present TabFSBench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating feature shifts in tabular data across four types of tabular models and multiple datasets. The study reveals three key findings: most existing tabular models are inadequately equipped to handle feature shifts; there is a linear relationship between the importance of shifted features and performance degradation of models; and performance in controlled (closed) environments often predicts performance when feature shifts occur. The benchmark is made accessible to the research community through a simple Python interface. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper introduces a new benchmark specifically tailored for feature shifts in tabular data—a relatively unexplored domain compared to distribution shifts. The focus on feature shifts is a novel and significant contribution that addresses a critical gap in the existing literature.  **Significance:** By highlighting the limitations of current tabular models in feature shift scenarios, the paper encourages further exploration and improvement in this area. This could spark new research directions and methods for mitigating the effects of feature shifts, which are often overlooked in practice. **Strengths:** - Introduction of TabFSBench, which is a practical tool for evaluating model performance under feature shifts. - Conducts comprehensive evaluations of various models against multiple datasets, broadening the applicability of results across different contexts. - Clear dissemination of findings which can inform future research. **Weaknesses:** - The study may need more extensive experiments to validate the findings across a wider range of contexts and datasets, as current evaluations are limited to only four model types. - The linkage of closed and open environments requires more nuanced exploration; simply correlating performance might oversimplify underlying complexities. **Potential Influence:** While the study lays an important groundwork for addressing feature shifts, its true impact will depend on how it influences subsequent research. If researchers adopt TabFSBench for further studies and develop new methods to handle feature shifts effectively, the influence could be substantial. **Score:** 8   Rationale: The paper's introduction of a specific benchmark and focus on a neglected area constitute a significant contribution to the field, demonstrating potential for influencing future research and practical applications. However, the limited scope of experimental validation and the need for deeper exploration into some findings prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, it represents a critical step forward in understanding and addressing feature shifts in tabular data.

Our overlap-based data mining and guided-triplet loss overcome the limitations of traditional distance-based mining and discrete class constraints. HeLiOS is validated on public datasets, demonstrating performance in heterogeneous LiDAR place recognition while including an evaluation for long-term recognition, showcasing its ability to handle unseen LiDAR types. We release the HeLiOS code as an open source for the robotics community at https://github.com/minwoo0611/HeLiOS.

### Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18950v1)
- **Authors**: Anh Bui, Trang Vu, Long Vuong, Trung Le, Paul Montague, Tamas Abraham, Junae Kim, Dinh Phung
- **Abstract**: Concept erasure has emerged as a promising technique for mitigating the risk of harmful content generation in diffusion models by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. The common principle of previous works to remove a specific concept is to map it to a fixed generic concept, such as a neutral concept or just an empty text prompt. In this paper, we demonstrate that this fixed-target strategy is suboptimal, as it fails to account for the impact of erasing one concept on the others. To address this limitation, we model the concept space as a graph and empirically analyze the effects of erasing one concept on the remaining concepts. Our analysis uncovers intriguing geometric properties of the concept space, where the influence of erasing a concept is confined to a local region. Building on this insight, we propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) method, which \emph{dynamically} selects optimal target concepts tailored to each undesirable concept, minimizing unintended side effects. Experimental results show that AGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art erasure methods on preserving unrelated concepts while maintaining effective erasure performance. Our code is published at {https://github.com/tuananhbui89/Adaptive-Guided-Erasure}.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Fantastic Targets for Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models and Where To Find Them" addresses the challenge of concept erasure in diffusion models, a method designed to remove harmful content generation by selectively unlearning undesirable concepts. Previous approaches typically employed fixed-target strategies, such as mapping undesirable concepts to neutral prompts, which the authors argue are suboptimal due to their failure to consider how removing one concept affects others. The authors introduce a novel framework that models the concept space as a graph and analyze the local impacts of erasing concepts on the broader space. They propose the Adaptive Guided Erasure (AGE) technique, which dynamically selects optimal targets tailored to specific undesirable concepts to minimize unintended consequences. Experimental results illustrate that AGE surpasses existing methods in preserving unrelated concepts while effectively erasing targeted harmful content. The authors support their findings with comprehensive empirical analyses and provide publicly accessible code. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The authors move beyond static fixed-target strategies for concept erasure by introducing a dynamic, graph-based model of the concept space, which is a pertinent advancement in the field. This recognition of the relationships among concepts allows for more nuanced erasure strategies. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides empirical analysis and experiments that substantiate the proposed method, demonstrating tangible improvements over existing erasure techniques. Such rigorous testing strengthens the reliability and applicability of their findings. 3. **Practical Significance**: As the ethical concerns regarding harmful content generation grow, the significance of effective concept erasure mechanisms is increasingly relevant. The proposed AGE method directly addresses these concerns, making it potentially impactful in real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: While the graph-based model is innovative, it could introduce additional complexity that may not be easily interpretable or implementable in practice. This complexity might hinder wider adoption without further simplification or clear guidelines. 2. **Limited Scope of Concept Analysis**: The paper, while insightful, may benefit from examining a wider variety of concepts and their interrelations beyond those studied. This could broaden the applicability of the findings across different domains of diffusion models. 3. **Lack of Comparative Baseline**: Although the authors claim superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques, without detailed comparative analysis against a diverse set of baselines across varied datasets and tasks, the generalizability of AGE remains uncertain. **Conclusion**: The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of diffusion models by introducing a method that addresses some practical limitations of previous concept erasure techniques. However, its complexity and the scope of the analysis could limit its immediate usability. Ultimately, the findings advance our understanding of relationship dynamics in concept erasure methods, with potential implications for future research and applications. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Shenghao Fu, Qize Yang, Qijie Mo, Junkai Yan, Xihan Wei, Jingke Meng, Xiaohua Xie, Wei-Shi Zheng
- **Abstract**: Recent open-vocabulary detectors achieve promising performance with abundant region-level annotated data. In this work, we show that an open-vocabulary detector co-training with a large language model by generating image-level detailed captions for each image can further improve performance. To achieve the goal, we first collect a dataset, GroundingCap-1M, wherein each image is accompanied by associated grounding labels and an image-level detailed caption. With this dataset, we finetune an open-vocabulary detector with training objectives including a standard grounding loss and a caption generation loss. We take advantage of a large language model to generate both region-level short captions for each region of interest and image-level long captions for the whole image. Under the supervision of the large language model, the resulting detector, LLMDet, outperforms the baseline by a clear margin, enjoying superior open-vocabulary ability. Further, we show that the improved LLMDet can in turn build a stronger large multi-modal model, achieving mutual benefits. The code, model, and dataset is available at https://github.com/iSEE-Laboratory/LLMDet.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "LLMDet: Learning Strong Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors under the Supervision of Large Language Models" presents a novel approach to enhancing open-vocabulary object detection by leveraging large language models (LLMs).

The proposed method, LLMDet, employs both grounding loss and caption generation loss to train an open-vocabulary detector, co-training it with a large language model to generate short captions for regions of interest and extensive captions summarizing entire images. The experimental results demonstrate that LLMDet significantly outperforms baseline models, exhibiting improved open-vocabulary capabilities. The authors also suggest that the advancements in LLMDet can contribute to the development of stronger multimodal models, indicating a bidirectional enhancement between the object detector and the language model. The authors have provided resources including code, models, and the dataset for further research. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The paper presents a novel integration of LLMs with open-vocabulary object detection, which is a significant contribution to the field.

### Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation in Large Language Models: A Novel Approach to Contextual Information Flow
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18957v1)
- **Authors**: Alfred Bexley, Lukas Radcliffe, Giles Weatherstone, Joseph Sakau
- **Abstract**: Context propagation remains a central challenge in language model architectures, particularly in tasks requiring the retention of long-range dependencies. Conventional attention mechanisms, while effective in many applications, exhibit limitations in maintaining coherent contextual representations over extended sequences due to their reliance on discrete token interactions. A novel approach is introduced through the formulation of Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual relationships as continuous tensor fields distributed across token embeddings. The propagation dynamics are governed through differential equations that enable a structured flow of contextual information, augmenting the standard attention mechanism to enhance coherence and recall. A series of experiments conducted on an open-source transformer-based model demonstrate that ITFP provides measurable improvements in contextual retention, dependency resolution, and inference stability across various linguistic structures. Comparisons with baseline models reveal a reduction in syntactic inconsistencies and factual errors, while ablation studies indicate that the choice of propagation depth and integration strength significantly impacts model performance. Additional evaluations assessing domain generalization suggest that ITFP effectively adapts across different text genres, reinforcing its applicability beyond conventional language modeling tasks. Although computational trade-offs are introduced through the inclusion of tensor field computations, empirical findings suggest that the benefits in accuracy and coherence outweigh the increased processing demands.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to addressing the challenge of context propagation in language models, particularly with long-range dependencies. It introduces Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual information as continuous tensor fields instead of relying on discrete token interactions as in conventional attention mechanisms. This method utilizes differential equations to govern the flow of information, aiming to improve coherence and recall in contextual representations. Experimental evaluations show ITFP enhances contextual retention, dependency resolution, and inference stability in a transformer-based model, with significant reductions in syntactic inconsistencies and factual errors compared to baseline models. The findings also indicate the model adapts well across different genres, although it incurs higher computational costs. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's novelty lies in its approach to contextual information flow using tensor fields, which diverges from traditional attention mechanisms. By conceptualizing contextual relationships continuously rather than discretely, ITFP offers a potentially transformative method of retaining information over longer sequences. This aspect could have significant implications for enhancing the performance of language models, particularly in complex linguistic tasks. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The introduction of tensor fields represents a fresh perspective in the area of context propagation, extending the capabilities of attention mechanisms. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide comprehensive experiments demonstrating the efficacy of ITFP in improving model outcomes, which adds credibility to their claims. 3. **Adaptability**: The ability of ITFP to generalize across various genres suggests its broad applicability, which could benefit applications in diverse linguistic contexts. Weaknesses: 1. **Computational Trade-offs**: While the improvement in accuracy and coherence is noteworthy, the increased computational costs could limit the practicality of ITFP in real-world applications, especially in environments with limited resources. 2. **Lack of Theoretical Framework**: The theoretical motivations and implications of using tensor fields over traditional models could be further developed. Providing more foundational theories could strengthen the approach's validity and encourage further exploration. 3. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: The experiments focus primarily on language model performance without extensively analyzing implications for downstream tasks in NLP where context retention is critical. Overall, while the paper presents a novel and meaningful advancement in the study of language models, its practical implementation challenges and the need for further theoretical insight temper its impact. Given these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. This reflects a solid contribution with significant potential for influence, albeit with notable limitations that warrant careful consideration in its adoption and future research. **Score: 7**

### Spend Wisely: Maximizing Post-Training Gains in Iterative Synthetic Data Boostrapping
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18962v1)
- **Authors**: Pu Yang, Yunzhen Feng, Ziyuan Chen, Yuhang Wu, Zhuoyuan Li
- **Abstract**: Modern foundation models often undergo iterative ``bootstrapping'' in their post-training phase: a model generates synthetic data, an external verifier filters out low-quality samples, and the high-quality subset is used for further fine-tuning. Over multiple iterations, the model's performance improves--raising a crucial question: how should the total budget on generation and training be allocated across iterations to maximize final performance? In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze budget allocation strategies. Specifically, we show that constant policies fail to converge with high probability, while increasing policies--particularly exponential growth policies--exhibit significant theoretical advantages. Experiments on image denoising with diffusion probabilistic models and math reasoning with large language models show that both exponential and polynomial growth policies consistently outperform constant policies, with exponential policies often providing more stable performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Spend Wisely: Maximizing Post-Training Gains in Iterative Synthetic Data Bootstrapping" addresses the challenge of budget allocation during the iterative bootstrapping process of foundation models. In this phase, a model generates synthetic data, which is then filtered by an external verifier; the high-quality samples are subsequently used to fine-tune the model. The authors investigate optimal strategies for allocating generative and training budgets across iterations to enhance final model performance. Their theoretical framework reveals that constant allocation policies are ineffective, while growth strategies, particularly exponential ones, significantly improve performance and stability in various applications (e.g., image denoising and math reasoning). The findings indicate the superiority of exponential and polynomial growth policies over constant approaches. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its theoretical analysis of budget allocation in a specific context of model training, particularly in the realm of synthetic data generation. While the concept of budget allocation is not entirely new, applying it within the framework of iterative synthetic data bootstrapping adds a fresh perspective to the field. The clear demonstration of the shortcomings of constant policies versus the advantages of growing policies offers valuable insights for practitioners and researchers. However, the paper could improve in several areas: 1. **Empirical Validation**: The experiments, while suggestive, could benefit from a broader range of tasks and datasets to generalize the findings effectively. The existing experiments focus on two particular contexts, which may not adequately represent the diversity of challenges in synthetic data generation and model fine-tuning. 2. **Practical Implications**: The theoretical framework is robust, yet the practical applications of implementing these strategies in real-world scenarios could be explored in more detail. Providing guidelines or heuristics for practitioners would enhance the relevance of the work. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: A more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in budget allocation could strengthen the argument for the proposed policies. Despite these weaknesses, the paper makes a meaningful contribution by providing a systematic approach to a crucial aspect of model training that has typically been underexplored. Its findings can influence future research and development in synthetic data generation, setting a precedent for considering dynamic allocation strategies. **Score: 7**

### BCAT: A Block Causal Transformer for PDE Foundation Models for Fluid Dynamics
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18972v1)
- **Authors**: Yuxuan Liu, Jingmin Sun, Hayden Schaeffer
- **Abstract**: We introduce BCAT, a PDE foundation model designed for autoregressive prediction of solutions to two dimensional fluid dynamics problems. Our approach uses a block causal transformer architecture to model next frame predictions, leveraging previous frames as contextual priors rather than relying solely on sub-frames or pixel-based inputs commonly used in image generation methods. This block causal framework more effectively captures the spatial dependencies inherent in nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics and physical phenomena. In an ablation study, next frame prediction demonstrated a 2.9x accuracy improvement over next token prediction. BCAT is trained on a diverse range of fluid dynamics datasets, including incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations across various geometries and parameter regimes, as well as the shallow-water equations. The model's performance was evaluated on 6 distinct downstream prediction tasks and tested on about 8K trajectories to measure robustness on a variety of fluid dynamics simulations. BCAT achieved an average relative error of 1.92% across all evaluation tasks, outperforming prior approaches on standard benchmarks.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper presents BCAT, a novel foundation model tailored for solving two-dimensional fluid dynamics problems through autoregressive prediction. It introduces a block causal transformer architecture that utilizes previous frames as contextual inputs, improving the modeling of spatial dependencies in complex fluid dynamics compared to traditional pixel-based methods. The authors report a significant accuracy increase of 2.9x in next frame predictions over existing token prediction methods in an ablation study. BCAT is empirically trained on various fluid dynamics datasets, including both incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and demonstrates robustness across several prediction tasks, achieving an average relative error of 1.92%. The results indicate BCAT's superiority over earlier models in standard benchmarks, underscoring its potential utility in the fluid dynamics domain. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces an innovative approach to modeling fluid dynamics through the application of transformer architectures, specifically against the backdrop of complex nonlinear dynamics. The shift from sub-frame or pixel-based approaches to a block causal design is noteworthy, as it addresses key challenges in fluid dynamics simulations by effectively capturing spatial dependencies. This methodological advancement contributes to the growing intersection of machine learning and computational fluid dynamics, representing a meaningful step forward in leveraging AI for physical simulations. Several strengths distinguish this work:  1. **Architecture Innovation:** The block causal transformer design is a significant departure from existing methods, promising better handling of temporal sequences in fluid dynamics. 2. **Robust Evaluation:** The extensive evaluation over 6 distinct downstream tasks and a large number of trajectories showcases the model's versatility and reliability. 3. **Performance Metrics:** The reported accuracy improvement over previous approaches is compelling, reinforcing the proposed method's effectiveness. However, there are some weaknesses to consider: 1. **Generalizability:** While performance on fluid dynamics problems is reported, it remains unclear how well the model performs on more diverse or extreme conditions outside the training datasets. The generalizability of the results beyond the tested geometries and parameter regimes should be examined further. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper claims superiority, a detailed comparative analysis against a broader range of state-of-the-art methodologies could strengthen the claims. 3. **Compute Resources:** The proposed architecture's computational demands and efficiency in terms of resource usage are not discussed, which could impact adoption in resource-constrained settings. Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper may not entirely redefine its field, but it does provide a meaningful, innovative contribution with specific advancements in fluid dynamics simulation techniques. **Score: 8**

### Symmetric Pruning of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18980v1)
- **Authors**: Kai Yi, Peter Richtárik
- **Abstract**: Popular post-training pruning methods such as Wanda and RIA are known for their simple, yet effective, designs that have shown exceptional empirical performance. Wanda optimizes performance through calibrated activations during pruning, while RIA emphasizes the relative, rather than absolute, importance of weight elements. Despite their practical success, a thorough theoretical foundation explaining these outcomes has been lacking. This paper introduces new theoretical insights that redefine the standard minimization objective for pruning, offering a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to their success. Our study extends beyond these insights by proposing complementary strategies that consider both input activations and weight significance. We validate these approaches through rigorous experiments, demonstrating substantial enhancements over existing methods. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training-free fine-tuning approach $R^2$-DSnoT that incorporates relative weight importance and a regularized decision boundary within a dynamic pruning-and-growing framework, significantly outperforming strong baselines and establishing a new state of the art.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Symmetric Pruning of Large Language Models" addresses limitations in existing post-training pruning methods, specifically Wanda and RIA, which have demonstrated good empirical results but lack a solid theoretical foundation. The authors propose a redefined objective for pruning that sheds light on the underlying principles of these methods. They introduce additional strategies that take into account both the significance of weight elements and input activations. The study validates these new approaches through experiments that show substantial improvements over current techniques. Furthermore, the authors present a novel training-free fine-tuning method named $R^2$-DSnoT that leverages relative weight importance and a regularized decision boundary in a dynamic pruning-and-growing framework. This method surpasses established baselines, setting a new benchmark in the field. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contribution:** The redefinition of the standard minimization objective provides a deeper understanding of pruning strategies, paving the way for future theoretical advancements in model optimization. 2. **Novel Methodology:** The introduction of $R^2$-DSnoT as a training-free fine-tuning method is a significant innovation, as it enhances model performance without the extensive overhead of re-training. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments offer robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which is crucial for establishing practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Existing Methods:** While the paper critiques Wanda and RIA, its innovations build upon these models rather than presenting a wholly independent approach. This reliance might limit the perceived novelty of the contributions. 2. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The paper could benefit from exploring the impact of the proposed methods across a broader range of tasks and datasets to reinforce generalizability. 3. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** The complexity of the introduced strategies might lead to overfitting in specific contexts, which should be addressed in future research. **Overall Significance:** The proposed theoretical insights and novel methods could reshape the landscape of pruning methods in large language models, potentially influencing future research directions and practical applications. Their substantial empirical improvements position this work as a key contribution, especially for practitioners looking to enhance model efficiency without sacrificing performance. ### Score Given these considerations, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. The contributions are significant and advance the state of the art in model pruning, but the proximity to existing methods and scope for more extensive empirical validation prevent it from reaching an exceptional level of novelty and impact.  **Score: 8**

### OmniPhysGS: 3D Constitutive Gaussians for General Physics-Based Dynamics Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18982v1)
- **Authors**: Yuchen Lin, Chenguo Lin, Jianjin Xu, Yadong Mu
- **Abstract**: Recently, significant advancements have been made in the reconstruction and generation of 3D assets, including static cases and those with physical interactions. To recover the physical properties of 3D assets, existing methods typically assume that all materials belong to a specific predefined category (e.g., elasticity). However, such assumptions ignore the complex composition of multiple heterogeneous objects in real scenarios and tend to render less physically plausible animation given a wider range of objects. We propose OmniPhysGS for synthesizing a physics-based 3D dynamic scene composed of more general objects. A key design of OmniPhysGS is treating each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians. For each Gaussian, its physical material is represented by an ensemble of 12 physical domain-expert sub-models (rubber, metal, honey, water, etc.), which greatly enhances the flexibility of the proposed model. In the implementation, we define a scene by user-specified prompts and supervise the estimation of material weighting factors via a pretrained video diffusion model. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OmniPhysGS achieves more general and realistic physical dynamics across a broader spectrum of materials, including elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid substances, as well as interactions between different materials. Our method surpasses existing methods by approximately 3% to 16% in metrics of visual quality and text alignment.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents OmniPhysGS, a novel approach for generating physics-based dynamics in 3D scenes that accommodates a diverse range of materials beyond the conventional predefined categories. The key innovation lies in representing each 3D asset as a collection of constitutive 3D Gaussians, with each Gaussian associated with a specific physical material characterized by an ensemble of 12 material sub-models (e.g., rubber, metal, etc.). This approach allows for a more nuanced representation of heterogeneous objects and their interactions, leading to enhancements in the realism of dynamic scene generation. The scene creation is guided by user prompts and a pretrained video diffusion model to estimate material weighting factors. Experimental results indicate that OmniPhysGS outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and text alignment metrics by approximately 3-16% across a variety of material types, such as elastic, viscoelastic, plastic, and fluid. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of using 3D Gaussians to model heterogeneous materials is a significant departure from traditional methods, which tend to oversimplify material interactions. This leads to more realistic simulations relevant to real-world applications. 2. **Flexibility:** The inclusion of a diverse set of material sub-models allows for the representation of complex scenes which are more reflective of real-life scenarios, where objects tend to have multiple material properties. 3. **User Guidance:** The use of user-specified prompts for scene definition is an important development, as it encourages user engagement and customization, potentially making the technology more accessible and useful in practical applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Pretrained Models:** The reliance on a pretrained video diffusion model for material weighting could limit the approach's flexibility if the pretrained model lacks certain nuances or fails to generalize well to unseen types of data. 2. **Potentially Limited Scope:** Although the paper claims improvements in the simulation of diverse materials, it would be beneficial to see more extensive evaluations, particularly in corner cases or combinations of extreme materials which commonly occur in real-world scenarios. 3. **Metric Evaluation:** The reported performance improvements (3% to 16%) may appear modest, raising questions about the practical significance of these gains in larger, more complex scenarios. **Significance in the Field:** OmniPhysGS addresses a critical gap in the simulation of complex physical interactions within 3D assets. Its approach could influence various fields including gaming, film, virtual reality, and engineering simulations where realistic material behavior is essential. However, for the impact to be fully realized, further validation with a wider range of materials and interactions will be necessary. **Overall Assessment:** The paper proposes compelling advancements and methodologies that are essential for the future of physics-based dynamic simulations. The innovative layering of material sub-models onto a Gaussian framework indicates a strong potential for practical applications, but further exploration of the limits of this model and its real-world applicability is warranted.

- **Authors**: Gyuseok Lee, Yaochen Zhu, Hwanjo Yu, Yao Zhou, Jundong Li
- **Abstract**: Diffusion-based recommender systems (DR) have gained increasing attention for their advanced generative and denoising capabilities. However, existing DR face two central limitations: (i) a trade-off between enhancing generative capacity via noise injection and retaining the loss of personalized information. (ii) the underutilization of rich item-side information. To address these challenges, we present a Collaborative Diffusion model for Recommender System (CDiff4Rec). Specifically, CDiff4Rec generates pseudo-users from item features and leverages collaborative signals from both real and pseudo personalized neighbors identified through behavioral similarity, thereby effectively reconstructing nuanced user preferences. Experimental results on three public datasets show that CDiff4Rec outperforms competitors by effectively mitigating the loss of personalized information through the integration of item content and collaborative signals.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a novel approach to address limitations in existing diffusion-based recommender systems (DR) through the Collaborative Diffusion model for Recommender System (CDiff4Rec). Current DR systems struggle with balancing noise injection to enhance generative capacity and the retention of personalized user information while also not fully leveraging item-side information. CDiff4Rec aims to bridge these gaps by generating pseudo-users based on item features and utilizing collaborative signals derived from both real and pseudo personalized neighbors, enhancing the reconstruction of nuanced user preferences. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CDiff4Rec outperforms existing methods across three public datasets by integrating item content and collaborative signals, thus effectively preserving personalized information. ### Evaluation: **Novelty (Score: 7/10):** The paper introduces an innovative framework for recommender systems by combining collaborative signals with pseudo-user generation based on item features. The effort to mitigate the generative capacity-loss of personalized information is commendable and showcases a new avenue in the realm of DR systems. This integration of item-side information and generation of pseudo-users differentiates this work from standard collaborative filtering approaches and enhances user representation. **Strengths:** - **Technological Integration:** The novel use of item features to create pseudo-users is a strong point, potentially enriching the user model and improving recommendation quality. - **Experimental Validation:** The paper's experimental results on three distinct datasets provide substantial evidence of the efficacy of CDiff4Rec, demonstrating its practical applicability. - **Addressing Gaps:** By explicitly targeting the limitations of existing DR systems, the work provides a clear contribution to improving recommendation accuracy and personalization. **Weaknesses:** - **Generalizability:** While the experiments are promising, the applicability of the proposed model across different domains and datasets remains to be confirmed. Further validation in real-world applications would strengthen its claims. - **Complexity and Scalability:** The model's reliance on generating pseudo-users and handling item-side information might introduce computational complexity, which could hinder scalability in large-scale systems. Additional analysis of this aspect would enhance the paper's usefulness. - **Comparison with State-of-the-Art:** While the presented results show improved performance, a more comprehensive comparison with other cutting-edge techniques could illuminate the advantages and disadvantages of this method more clearly. **Potential Influence:** The proposed model has the potential to influence future research in recommendation systems by encouraging further exploration into the synthesis of user and item features. It sets the stage for exploring more intricate models that fuse generative and collaborative approaches, paving the way for enhanced personalization techniques. In conclusion, while CDiff4Rec offers a compelling advancement in the field, further validation, scalability assessments, and deeper contextual comparisons with existing DR systems are needed to cement its place as a transformative approach in the recommended systems landscape. **Score: 7**

### Importing Phantoms: Measuring LLM Package Hallucination Vulnerabilities
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19012v1)
- **Authors**: Arjun Krishna, Erick Galinkin, Leon Derczynski, Jeffrey Martin
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential tool in the programmer's toolkit, but their tendency to hallucinate code can be used by malicious actors to introduce vulnerabilities to broad swathes of the software supply chain. In this work, we analyze package hallucination behaviour in LLMs across popular programming languages examining both existing package references and fictional dependencies. By analyzing this package hallucination behaviour we find potential attacks and suggest defensive strategies to defend against these attacks. We discover that package hallucination rate is predicated not only on model choice, but also programming language, model size, and specificity of the coding task request. The Pareto optimality boundary between code generation performance and package hallucination is sparsely populated, suggesting that coding models are not being optimized for secure code. Additionally, we find an inverse correlation between package hallucination rate and the HumanEval coding benchmark, offering a heuristic for evaluating the propensity of a model to hallucinate packages. Our metrics, findings and analyses provide a base for future models, securing AI-assisted software development workflows against package supply chain attacks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Importing Phantoms: Measuring LLM Package Hallucination Vulnerabilities" investigates the tendency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fictitious software package references, a phenomenon referred to as "package hallucination." This behavior poses potential security vulnerabilities in software development, as malicious actors could exploit it. The authors analyze how various factors—including programming language, model size, and specificity of the coding task—affect hallucination rates. They find that there is a correlation between package hallucination and existing coding benchmarks, specifically noting an inverse correlation with the HumanEval benchmark. The paper proposes defensive strategies and highlights that current coding models are not optimized for generating secure code, suggesting a gap in prevailing research and practical applications in software security. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several strengths. Firstly, it addresses a timely and critical issue within software development—the security implications of LLMs, which have seen rapid adoption. The identification of potential attacks stemming from hallucination behaviors and the relationship established between coding performance and hallucination rates contribute valuable insights to the field of AI-assisted software development. Additionally, proposing metrics for future model evaluations enhances the paper's practical applicability, guiding future research directions. However, the paper exhibits some weaknesses. While the analysis of language models across different programming languages is commendable, it may benefit from deeper exploration into the specific contexts and conditions under which hallucination occurs. Furthermore, the proposed defensive strategies could be elaborated upon to provide meaningful practical guidance for developers integrating LLMs into their workflows. More extensive empirical validation of the metrics and their effectiveness in real-world scenarios would strengthen the paper's conclusions. The novelty of the research is significant, as it tackles the intersection of AI and software security, an area that is increasingly becoming relevant. However, the foundation it builds on—LLM behavior observation—is an expanding field with numerous ongoing studies, which may limit the uniqueness of its contributions.  Overall, the paper adds substantial value to the discussion around AI-induced vulnerabilities and provides a framework for future research in model evaluation and software security.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's noteworthy contributions balanced with some limitations in depth and empirical validation, marking it as a strong yet not fully definitive reference in its domain.

- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable advancements in integrating different modalities, excelling in complex understanding and generation tasks. Despite their success, MLLMs remain vulnerable to conversational adversarial inputs, particularly negation arguments. This paper systematically evaluates state-of-the-art MLLMs across diverse benchmarks, revealing significant performance drops when negation arguments are introduced to initially correct responses. We show critical vulnerabilities in the reasoning and alignment mechanisms of these models. Proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet demonstrate better resilience compared to open-source counterparts like Qwen2-VL and LLaVA. However, all evaluated MLLMs struggle to maintain logical consistency under negation arguments during conversation. This paper aims to offer valuable insights for improving the robustness of MLLMs against adversarial inputs, contributing to the development of more reliable and trustworthy multimodal AI systems.

While proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet show some resilience against these adversarial inputs, the paper notes that all models evaluated fail to maintain logical consistency. This research aims to inform future improvements in the robustness and reliability of MLLMs, contributing to the advancement of trustworthy multimodal AI systems. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its concentrated focus on the impact of negation arguments on MLLMs, an area that has not received extensive attention in the existing literature. The systematic evaluation of these models under a specific type of adversarial attack provides a fresh perspective on the limitations of current MLLM technology. The authors successfully demonstrate that even the most advanced proprietary models are not immune to such vulnerabilities, which is crucial for the understanding of MLLM behavior and reliability. However, the significance of the research could be viewed through a critical lens. While the findings regarding the vulnerabilities of MLLMs are important, the paper does not delve deeply enough into potential solutions or strategies for mitigating these issues, limiting its practical implications. Furthermore, it primarily focuses on performance metrics without exploring the underlying causes of the observed failures, which might restrict the foundational understanding necessary for developing robust models. The research could also be strengthened by including a more diverse range of MLLM models, particularly from emerging open-source projects, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of this problem. Additionally, a discussion on the implications of these findings for the deployment of MLLMs in real-world scenarios could enhance the overall impact of the study. Overall, while the paper does present significant insights into an under-explored vulnerability of MLLMs, its lack of actionable outcomes and comprehensive exploration of underlying mechanisms slightly diminishes its contribution. Thus, based on the originality of the focus and insights offered, while considering the limitations noted, I assign the paper a score of 7. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19036v1)
- **Authors**: Hongliang Li, Jiaxin Zhang, Wenhui Liao, Dezhi Peng, Kai Ding, Lianwen Jin
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are typically based on decoder-only or cross-attention architectures. While decoder-only MLLMs outperform their cross-attention counterparts, they require significantly higher computational resources due to extensive self-attention and FFN operations on visual tokens. This raises the question: can we eliminate these expensive operations while maintaining the performance? To this end, we present a novel analysis framework to investigate the necessity of these costly operations in decoder-only MLLMs. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) Hollow Attention, which limits visual token interactions to local attention while maintaining visual-text associations, and (2) Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN, which selectively activates FFN parameters for visual tokens. Both methods do not require fine-tuning, which significantly enhances analysis efficiency. To assess the impact of applying these reductions across different proportions of layers, we developed a greedy search method that significantly narrows the search space. Experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that applying our reductions to approximately half of the layers not only maintains but sometimes improves model performance, indicating significant computational redundancy in current architectures. Additionally, our method is orthogonal to existing token compression techniques, allowing for further combination to achieve greater computational reduction. Our findings may provide valuable insights for the design of more efficient future MLLMs. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/L-Hugh/Beyond-Token-Compression.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses challenges in the efficiency of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly those based on decoder-only architectures, which are more resource-intensive than cross-attention models. The authors propose a training-free approach to reduce computational demands while preserving or enhancing performance. Their innovations include "Hollow Attention," which restricts visual token interactions to a local scope without losing visual-text connections, and "Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN," which selectively activates feedforward network parameters for visual tokens. Their methods, tested on state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrated that applying reductions to about half of the model’s layers can maintain and even enhance performance, suggesting that current architectures may have substantial computational redundancy. The paper also notes that their approach complements existing token compression techniques, potentially enabling further optimizations. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The paper introduces unique techniques, particularly the "Hollow Attention" and "Probe-Activated Dynamic FFN," that address the efficiency of visual processing in MLLMs without the need for extensive fine-tuning. This is a noteworthy contribution, as it attempts to reduce computational costs while aiming to maintain model performance, which is crucial in deploying large models.     2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors validate their approaches through experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs, providing substantial evidence that their methods can effectively reduce computational demands without hampering performance. This empirical backing enhances the credibility of their contributions. 3. **Broader Implications:** The results indicate significant redundancies in existing architectures, opening up avenues for further research in model design and efficiencies in MLLMs beyond the proposals made in this paper. 4. **Ease of Implementation:** The emphasis on a training-free framework is appealing for practical applications, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to adopt these methods without the need for retraining large models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Theoretical Underpinning:** While the paper demonstrates empirical success, it falls somewhat short in providing a comprehensive theoretical explanation for why these reductions work effectively. The lack of strong theoretical justification may limit understanding and broader applicability in different contexts.     2. **Scalability Concerns:** The paper primarily discusses results based on current architectures, but it does not delve deeply into whether these methods would scale effectively across all MLLM types or sizes. It may be useful to consider the long-term applicability of their methods on greatly varied architectures. 3. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** Although the experiments show promising impacts, a more varied set of evaluation metrics beyond performance—such as energy consumption, inference time, and generalization ability—could provide a more rounded assessment of the methods' benefits. 4. **Potential Overlooked Variables:** The proposed methods might have unexplored interactions with existing model components, and a more detailed investigation into possible side effects could strengthen their contributions. **Overall Assessment:** The paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the quest for more efficient MLLMs, with practical implications for model design and deployment. While it demonstrates the potential for significant computational reductions, the lack of robust theoretical backing and consideration of diverse model scenarios limits its comprehensive impact in the field. Nevertheless, the findings are relevant and could influence future research on MLLM architectures. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the balance between the paper's innovative approach and contributions against its limitations in theoretical justification and scope of validation.

### Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19040v1)
- **Authors**: Huanran Chen, Yinpeng Dong, Zeming Wei, Hang Su, Jun Zhu
- **Abstract**: Recent studies have revealed the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks, where the adversary crafts specific input sequences to induce harmful, violent, private, or incorrect outputs. Although various defenses have been proposed, they have not been evaluated by strong adaptive attacks, leaving the worst-case robustness of LLMs still intractable. By developing a stronger white-box attack, our evaluation results indicate that most typical defenses achieve nearly 0\% robustness.To solve this, we propose \textit{DiffTextPure}, a general defense that diffuses the (adversarial) input prompt using any pre-defined smoothing distribution, and purifies the diffused input using a pre-trained language model. Theoretically, we derive tight robustness lower bounds for all smoothing distributions using Fractal Knapsack or 0-1 Knapsack solvers. Under this framework, we certify the robustness of a specific case -- smoothing LLMs using a uniform kernel -- against \textit{any possible attack} with an average $\ell_0$ perturbation of 2.02 or an average suffix length of 6.41.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Towards the Worst-case Robustness of Large Language Models" addresses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to adversarial attacks that can elicit harmful outputs. While previous defenses have been proposed, they have not been effectively challenged by adaptive attacks, leaving the worst-case resilience of LLMs unassessed. The authors introduce a novel defense mechanism called \textit{DiffTextPure}, which works by diffusing input prompts through predefined smoothing distributions and later purifying them using a pre-trained language model. The authors provide theoretical foundations for their approach by deriving lower bounds on robustness via optimization techniques, specifically Fractal Knapsack and 0-1 Knapsack solvers. They validate the effectiveness of their method by showing robust performance against any attack using a uniform kernel, achieving tight bounds with an average perturbation of 2.02. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper makes a notable contribution to an important and timely issue—the robustness of LLMs against adversarial attacks.  **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Gap**: The paper identifies a significant gap in prior work where defenses were inadequately tested against adaptive attacks, ultimately leading to the proposal of a stronger attack framework. 2. **Novel Defense Mechanism**: The proposed \textit{DiffTextPure} provides an innovative method for input smoothing and purification that may enhance robustness in a measurable way. 3. **Theoretical Foundations**: Deriving tight robustness lower bounds is a mathematically rigorous approach that could pave the way for future research in the area, providing a stronger theoretical basis for the contributions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Presentation and Clarity**: Some of the theoretical derivations and their implications could be better articulated for clarity, as it might hinder understanding for non-specialist readers. 2. **Scope of Evaluation**: While the evaluation seems thorough, it would benefit from testing against a broader range of adversarial strategies and showing generalizability across different types of LLM architectures. 3. **Practical Implementation**: Real-world applicability and computational efficiency of the proposed defense are not addressed in detail, which are critical factors for adoption in tactical environments. **Potential Influence**: The implications of this research are significant for safe deployment of LLMs in sensitive applications. By advancing the understanding of adversarial robustness, it could lead to the development of more resilient AI systems. **Overall Score**: Given the paper's theoretical advancements, the introduction of a novel defense mechanism, and its contributions to the ongoing discourse on AI security, I would assign it a score of 8. It holds substantial promise in addressing a crucial vulnerability in LLMs, despite areas where the clarity and practical applicability could be improved.  **Score: 8**

### Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Text-Image Time Series Retrieval in Remote Sensing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19043v1)
- **Authors**: Genc Hoxha, Olivér Angyal, Begüm Demir
- **Abstract**: The development of image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods is a growing research interest in remote sensing (RS). Given a user-defined image time series (i.e., the query time series), the ITSR methods search and retrieve from large archives the image time series that have similar content to the query time series. The existing ITSR methods in RS are designed for unimodal retrieval problems, limiting their usability and versatility. To overcome this issue, as a first time in RS we introduce the task of cross-modal text-ITSR. In particular, we present a self-supervised cross-modal text-image time series retrieval (text-ITSR) method that enables the retrieval of image time series using text sentences as queries, and vice versa. In detail, we focus our attention on text-ITSR in pairs of images (i.e., bitemporal images). The proposed text-ITSR method consists of two key components: 1) modality-specific encoders to model the semantic content of bitemporal images and text sentences with discriminative features; and 2) modality-specific projection heads to align textual and image representations in a shared embedding space. To effectively model the temporal information within the bitemporal images, we introduce two fusion strategies: i) global feature fusion (GFF) strategy that combines global image features through simple yet effective operators; and ii) transformer-based feature fusion (TFF) strategy that leverages transformers for fine-grained temporal integration. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark RS archives demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in accurately retrieving semantically relevant bitemporal images (or text sentences) to a query text sentence (or bitemporal image). The code of this work is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/cross-modal-text-tsir.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel method for Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Text-Image Time Series Retrieval (text-ITSR) in the field of remote sensing. It aims to enhance the existing unimodal image time series retrieval (ITSR) methods by introducing a cross-modal approach that allows retrieval of image time series using text queries and vice versa. The method utilizes modality-specific encoders to extract features from bitemporal images and text, along with projection heads to align these representations in a shared embedding space. Additionally, two fusion strategies, global feature fusion (GFF) and transformer-based feature fusion (TFF), are employed to capture temporal information effectively. The proposed approach is benchmarked against two remote sensing datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving semantically relevant content. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** This paper marks a significant development in the domain of remote sensing by addressing a dual-modal retrieval challenge that has not been extensively explored in the literature. The shift towards cross-modal retrieval through bitemporal images and text expands the capabilities beyond traditional ITSR methods, offering a practical solution for researchers and practitioners who may not have access to traditional image labels. This innovation is the crux of the paper's contribution. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of cross-modal retrieval is a notable advancement, filling a gap in current methodologies within remote sensing. 2. **Self-Supervised Learning:** By leveraging self-supervised techniques, the approach alleviates the dependency on labeled data, which is often scarce in remote sensing. 3. **Comprehensive Experimentation:** The paper provides extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed method on established benchmarks, enhancing its credibility. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The use of two distinct fusion strategies (GFF and TFF) may complicate the implementation process, potentially discouraging adoption among practitioners. 2. **Future Scope and Limitations:** While the method is promising, the paper could delve deeper into limitations and potential challenges encountered during the experiments, such as generalizability across diverse datasets. 3. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** Although the performance is validated against benchmarks, a more thorough comparative analysis with existing retrieval methods could strengthen the evidence of superiority. **Impact on the Field:** This research has the potential to significantly affect remote sensing practices by facilitating more versatile retrieval methods. Cross-modal capabilities could foster the integration of diverse data types, promoting interdisciplinary research. However, to achieve significant changes in standard practices, this novel method must be tested widely across various applications and integrated into existing workflows. Score: **8**

### Text-to-CAD Generation Through Infusing Visual Feedback in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19054v1)
- **Authors**: Ruiyu Wang, Yu Yuan, Shizhao Sun, Jiang Bian
- **Abstract**: Creating Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models requires significant expertise and effort. Text-to-CAD, which converts textual descriptions into CAD parametric sequences, is crucial in streamlining this process. Recent studies have utilized ground-truth parametric sequences, known as sequential signals, as supervision to achieve this goal. However, CAD models are inherently multimodal, comprising parametric sequences and corresponding rendered visual objects. Besides,the rendering process from parametric sequences to visual objects is many-to-one. Therefore, both sequential and visual signals are critical for effective training. In this work, we introduce CADFusion, a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as the backbone and alternates between two training stages: the sequential learning (SL) stage and the visual feedback (VF) stage. In the SL stage, we train LLMs using ground-truth parametric sequences, enabling the generation of logically coherent parametric sequences. In the VF stage, we reward parametric sequences that render into visually preferred objects and penalize those that do not, allowing LLMs to learn how rendered visual objects are perceived and evaluated. These two stages alternate throughout the training, ensuring balanced learning and preserving benefits of both signals. Experiments demonstrate that CADFusion significantly improves performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents CADFusion, a framework designed to convert textual descriptions into Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Recognizing that CAD models are multimodal and encompass both parametric sequences and visual objects, the authors construct a dual-stage training process. In the Sequential Learning (SL) stage, LLMs are trained on ground-truth parametric sequences to ensure coherent outputs. Additionally, in the Visual Feedback (VF) stage, the framework adjusts the LLMs based on the visual appeal of the rendered outputs by rewarding successful visual representations while penalizing the unsuccessful ones. This alternating approach enhances the model's ability to generate both logically sound and visually appealing CAD designs, leading to substantial improvements in performance as demonstrated through experiments. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its dual-stage training methodology, which introduces visual evaluation into the CAD generation process. By augmenting traditional parametric sequence training with visual feedback, CADFusion aligns closer with real-world practices where both functional and aesthetic factors are critical in design. The use of LLMs as the backbone for this task indicates an innovative approach to a long-standing challenge, making the work stand out among existing solutions. Strengths: 1. **Integration of Multimodal Learning**: The paper effectively combines sequential and visual modalities, addressing an important gap in CAD generation methods. 2. **Improved Performance**: The experimental results underscore a significant performance boost, thereby validating the proposed framework. 3. **Relevance to Industry**: With CAD being crucial in engineering and design, the practical implications of this research are substantial, potentially influencing tools used in these fields. Weaknesses: 1. **Scalability and Generalization**: While the results reported are promising, there is a lack of discussion regarding how well CADFusion generalizes across diverse CAD applications or industries. 2. **Complexity of Training**: The alternating training might introduce complexities in tuning and training dynamics, which could hinder practical implementation in quick turnaround environments. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the paper notes qualitative and quantitative improvements, a more robust discussion on evaluation metrics would help clarify the extent of performance gains. In conclusion, while CADFusion presents a meaningful contribution to the field of CAD generation by infusing visual feedback into LLMs, there are concerns regarding its scalability and the practical balance of training complexity. However, its novelty, relevance, and demonstrated performance improve its standing. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: The increasing complexity of modern software systems necessitates robust autonomic self-management capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in this domain, they often face challenges in adapting their general knowledge to specific service contexts. To address this limitation, we propose ServiceOdyssey, a self-learning agent system that autonomously manages microservices without requiring prior knowledge of service-specific configurations. By leveraging curriculum learning principles and iterative exploration, ServiceOdyssey progressively develops a deep understanding of operational environments, reducing dependence on human input or static documentation. A prototype built with the Sock Shop microservice demonstrates the potential of this approach for autonomic microservice management.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Enabling Autonomic Microservice Management through Self-Learning Agents" focuses on addressing the challenges associated with the complexity of modern software systems, particularly in the management of microservices. The authors introduce ServiceOdyssey, a self-learning agent system designed to autonomously manage microservices without requiring detailed prior knowledge of their configurations. The key innovation lies in the application of curriculum learning principles and iterative exploration methods, allowing the agent to build a comprehensive understanding of its operational environment over time. A prototype was tested using the Sock Shop microservice, demonstrating the effectiveness of ServiceOdyssey in reducing the reliance on human inputs or static documentation in the microservice management process. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of this paper prominently lies in its integration of self-learning agents with curriculum learning for microservice management. This approach offers a new perspective on autonomic computing, as it reduces the cognitive load on developers and operators while allowing systems to better adapt to their operating conditions dynamically. The suggestion that large language models (LLMs) can be limited in microservice contexts also highlights a critical gap in the existing literature, positioning ServiceOdyssey as a potential remedy. The significance of this work stems from its practical implications for software engineering and operations, as it addresses a pressing challenge faced by organizations aiming to manage increasingly complex infrastructures. The prototype demonstration with Sock Shop adds a layer of credibility, showing that the theoretical framework can translate into real-world applications. However, there are weaknesses to consider. The paper may not sufficiently explore the scalability of the ServiceOdyssey framework across varied operational paradigms beyond the Sock Shop example. The potential risks or pitfalls of relying heavily on self-learning agents in critical systems, such as reliability issues, lack of human oversight, or unforeseen emergent behaviors, are not thoroughly discussed. Overall, while the paper contributes valuable insights into autonomic microservice management, its limited scope in addressing wider application scenarios and implications for operational stability reflects a need for further exploration in future research.  **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with distinct novelty, yet it acknowledges the necessity for deeper analysis and broader illustrations of application scenarios to elevate its impact more significantly within the microsystem management discipline.

### TeZO: Empowering the Low-Rankness on the Temporal Dimension in the Zeroth-Order Optimization for Fine-tuning LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19057v1)
- **Authors**: Yan Sun, Tiansheng Huang, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Dacheng Tao
- **Abstract**: Zeroth-order optimization (ZO) has demonstrated remarkable promise in efficient fine-tuning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, recent advances incorporate the low-rankness of gradients, introducing low-rank ZO estimators to further reduce GPU memory consumption. However, most existing works focus solely on the low-rankness of each individual gradient, overlooking a broader property shared by all gradients throughout the training, i.e., all gradients approximately reside within a similar subspace. In this paper, we consider two factors together and propose a novel low-rank ZO estimator, TeZO, which captures the low-rankness across both the model and temporal dimension. Specifically, we represent ZO perturbations along the temporal dimension as a 3D tensor and employ Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) to extract each low-rank 2D matrix, significantly reducing the training cost. TeZO can also be easily extended to the Adam variant while consuming less memory than MeZO-SGD, and requiring about only 35% memory of MeZO-Adam. Both comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental research have validated its efficiency, achieving SOTA-comparable results with lower overhead of time and memory.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces TeZO, a new low-rank zeroth-order optimization (ZO) estimator designed for the efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs). While previous low-rank methods focused solely on individual gradients, TeZO leverages the consistent low-rank structure across gradients in the temporal dimension. By utilizing a 3D tensor representation of ZO perturbations and applying Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD), the proposed method captures both model-level and temporal low-rank characteristics, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost. TeZO is shown to be a memory-efficient alternative, especially when compared to MeZO frameworks, and can be adapted to the Adam optimization method. The results indicate that TeZO achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art techniques while using approximately 35% of the memory of its predecessors, demonstrating both theoretical promise and practical application. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance** TeZO stands out in the area of zeroth-order optimization for its innovative approach to integrating both individual gradient low-rankness and the collective low-rank properties of gradients over time. This dual consideration reflects a deeper understanding of the structure of gradients in training LLMs, which is a significant advancement. By addressing the oversight in previous methods—namely, the lack of integration of temporal subspace properties—TeZO offers a fresh perspective that could spur further research in gradient utilization, potentially leading to more efficient training paradigms. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The introduction of a tensor-based representation and the application of CPD to capture low-rank structures across both model parameters and temporal gradients show strong methodological innovation. 2. **Efficiency Gains:** The substantial memory savings (about 35% less than MeZO-Adam) and comparable performance indicate practical relevance, which is essential for real-world applications of LLM fine-tuning. 3. **Theoretical and Empirical Validation:** Theoretical analysis coupled with extensive experiments strengthens the argument for TeZO’s effectiveness. Weaknesses: 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The novelty in the approach comes with increased complexity; cognitive overload and implementation hurdles could limit adoption among practitioners. 2. **Dependence on Prior Work:** While TeZO builds on previous low-rank frameworks, the incremental improvements could be seen as an evolution rather than a revolutionary leap, diminishing its perceived novelty by some in the community. 3. **Generalization:** The paper does not extensively explore how TeZO performs across varying types of models beyond current benchmarks, which limits the scope of understanding its versatility. **Influence on the Field** Overall, TeZO has the potential to positively influence the field of optimization for AI model training by introducing new approaches to efficiently handle gradient information and reducing resource demands. It encourages researchers to think about gradient structures more holistically, potentially shaping future work around low-rank optimization. **Score:** 8 This score reflects a recognition of the paper's significant contribution and innovative angle on a vital aspect of model training, tempered by considerations of complexity and scope of implementation.

### Concept Steerers: Leveraging K-Sparse Autoencoders for Controllable Generations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19066v1)
- **Authors**: Dahye Kim, Deepti Ghadiyaram
- **Abstract**: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lack scalability, and/or compromise generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than current state-of-the-art.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Concept Steerers: Leveraging K-Sparse Autoencoders for Controllable Generations" presents a new approach to improve the control and safety of text-to-image generative models. It introduces k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) as a means to manipulate specific concepts in the latent space of text embeddings without incurring the heavy computational costs associated with model fine-tuning. This framework allows for clear manipulation of concepts—removing or adding specific attributes during the generation process without compromising the quality of the output. Notably, the authors claim that their method demonstrates a 20.01% improvement in the removal of unsafe concepts and is about five times faster than current state-of-the-art methods. The approach is characterized as straightforward, requiring no retraining of existing models and showing robustness to adversarial manipulations. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of k-sparse autoencoders for concept manipulation is a novel contribution that addresses a significant issue in text-to-image generation, namely the control of content generation to mitigate adversarial risks and ethical concerns. 2. **Efficiency and Scalability:** The method emphasizes efficiency since it does not require costly retraining or complex adaptations (like LoRA), which makes it more scalable for real-world applications. 3. **Quality Preservation:** The assertion that generation quality remains intact while enabling concept steering is significant for practical deployment, as it addresses concerns about the trade-offs often involved in such enhancements. 4. **Robustness:** The paper highlights the robustness of the approach against adversarial prompts, which is a critical aspect for ensuring trustworthy AI systems. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the empirical improvements are notable, the paper does not sufficiently explore various edge cases or diverse scenarios in which concept manipulation might fail, potentially limiting the generalizability of the method. 2. **Lack of Theoretical Insights:** The paper could benefit from a more in-depth theoretical explanation of why k-sparse autoencoders are particularly suited for this task compared to previous methods. A deeper exploration into the implications and limitations of the k-sparse representation would strengthen the contribution. 3. **Comparison with Other Methods:** Although the paper claims superiority over current methods, a more detailed comparative analysis with other existing techniques in the literature would enhance the credibility of their claims. **Significance within the Field:** The problem of unsafe and unethical content generation is pressing in the development of generative models, and this paper sets forth a promising direction for addressing it efficiently. The emphasis on interpretable and controllable generations could pave the way for future research that prioritizes ethical considerations in AI content creation.  Overall, this paper makes valuable contributions to the domains of generative modeling and AI safety, offering methods that are practical and effective in real-world applications. ### Score: 8 The score reflects the paper’s commendable innovation and potential for significant impact while also acknowledging the areas for improvement in evaluation and theoretical depth. While it presents a strong foundation for future research, further validation and depth of comparison with existing methods could have elevated its contribution.

### MotionPCM: Real-Time Motion Synthesis with Phased Consistency Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19083v1)
- **Authors**: Lei Jiang, Ye Wei, Hao Ni
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have become a popular choice for human motion synthesis due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, their high computational complexity and large sampling steps pose challenges for real-time applications. Fortunately, the Consistency Model (CM) provides a solution to greatly reduce the number of sampling steps from hundreds to a few, typically fewer than four, significantly accelerating the synthesis of diffusion models. However, its application to text-conditioned human motion synthesis in latent space remains challenging. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{MotionPCM}, a phased consistency model-based approach designed to improve the quality and efficiency of real-time motion synthesis in latent space.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "MotionPCM: Real-Time Motion Synthesis with Phased Consistency Model" addresses the challenges associated with using diffusion models for human motion synthesis, particularly in real-time applications. While diffusion models are recognized for their strong generative performance, they suffer from high computational demands and require many sampling steps to generate quality outputs, which makes them less viable for real-time scenarios. The authors propose a solution by leveraging a Consistency Model (CM) to reduce the number of required sampling steps from hundreds to just a few, typically fewer than four. However, applying this technique to text-conditioned human motion synthesis in latent space has significant challenges. The authors present MotionPCM, a phased consistency model-based approach that streamlines the synthesis process, enhancing both the quality and efficiency of generating motions in real time. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The novelty of MotionPCM lies in its strategic integration of phased consistency with diffusion models to produce real-time human motion synthesis. By successfully addressing the computational bottlenecks and improving synthesis efficiency, this work stands out within the realm of motion generation, which is critical for applications in animation, virtual reality, and gaming. The introduction of a new approach that operates effectively in latent space and requires significantly fewer computational resources opens opportunities for broader applications. However, the paper also has notable limitations. The performance metrics and comparisons to existing techniques need to be more rigorously articulated. While the authors suggest a clearer velocity in synthesis steps, quantifying advances against state-of-the-art models with comprehensive benchmarks would bolster their claims. The broader implications of the findings in terms of how such reductions influence the overall fidelity and robustness of synthesized motions are also inadequately discussed. Furthermore, while the approach is innovative, the practical implementation details such as scalability and adaptability to diverse motion styles have not been thoroughly examined. The transition from theoretical efficacy to practical utility in varied real-world scenarios remains to be fully validated. Considering the strengths in addressing a significant computational challenge and contributing to improving real-time motion generation, alongside the weaknesses in comprehensive evaluation and practical implications, I would assign a score of **7**. This reflects a significant contribution to the field, marked by promise in enhancing efficiency and quality but tempered by a need for further empirical validation and exploration of practical applications. **Score: 7**

### Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19085v1)
- **Authors**: Alessandro Giagnorio, Alberto Martin-Lopez, Gabriele Bavota
- **Abstract**: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. LLMs rely on large and diverse datasets to learn syntax, semantics, and usage patterns of programming languages. For low-resource languages (i.e., niche programming languages characterized by the scarcity of training data), the limited availability of such data hampers the models' ability to generalize effectively, resulting in poorer code generation performance as compared to high-resource languages. For this reason, there is a quest for techniques able to close this performance gap. We present an empirical study investigating the effectiveness of several approaches for boosting LLMs' performance on low-resource languages, namely: (i) a classic fine-tuning, which is however capped in size by the scarcity of training data; (ii) three variants of in-context learning, with prompts crafted to provide the LLM with additional information about the low-resource language (e.g., few-shot examples showcasing features of the targeted language); and (iii) a pre-training objective teaching the model how to translate between high- and low-resource languages. The context of our study are two low-resource languages (R and Racket) and six LLMs having different architectures and sizes. Our findings reveal that a fine-tuning is usually the best choice for smaller LLMs, possibly due to the fact that even a small dataset is sufficient to train their limited number of parameters. With the increase in size of the models, in-context learning becomes more and more effective, representing a safe and cheap bet (i.e., it always helps, but with different magnitudes). Differently, very large LLMs may deteriorate their performance on low-resource languages when fine-tuning is performed, possibly due to the lack of enough data needed to effectively update their weights.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Enhancing Code Generation for Low-Resource Languages: No Silver Bullet" investigates the challenges and potential solutions in the context of automated code generation for low-resource programming languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The scarcity of training data for these niche languages results in suboptimal model performance when compared to high-resource languages. The authors explore multiple strategies to enhance code generation for such languages: (i) fine-tuning LLMs, albeit limited by data availability; (ii) in-context learning techniques using informative prompts; and (iii) a pre-training mechanism designed to facilitate translation between high- and low-resource languages. The study focuses on the low-resource languages R and Racket and evaluates six LLMs of varying sizes and architectures. Results show that smaller models benefit most from fine-tuning, while larger models perform better with in-context learning, although very large models can suffer from fine-tuning if the training data is insufficient.  **Critical Evaluation:** The paper offers valuable insights into the specific challenges posed by low-resource programming languages in the context of LLMs, which is an important and often overlooked area in the broader field of code generation. The exploration of various methods (fine-tuning, in-context learning, and pre-training objectives) is particularly noteworthy as it contributes to a deeper understanding of how LLMs can be effectively applied to enhance performance in contexts where data is scarce. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance**: The focus on low-resource programming languages addresses a critical gap in existing literature, highlighting an important aspect of LLM application. 2. **Empirical Study**: The use of an empirical approach allows for practical insights and evidence-based conclusions regarding the performance of different techniques. 3. **Variety of LLMs**: The investigation of multiple LLM architectures enhances the robustness of the findings and allows for generalization across various model sizes. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: The study is constrained to only two low-resource languages (R and Racket), which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additional languages could provide a broader perspective. 2. **Lack of Theoretical Framework**: While the empirical data is rich, the paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical framework linking findings to existing theories on code generation and LLM training paradigms. 3. **Generalizability of Results**: The variations in performance based on model size and training strategy raise questions about how findings might apply to other low-resource languages not covered in the study. The paper contributes meaningfully to the field by elucidating critical strategies for improving LLM performance in low-resource settings, a topic with increasing importance as automated code generation becomes more prevalent.  Based on these considerations, I assign a score of **8**. While the paper makes a significant contribution by addressing a crucial issue in code generation, the limited scope and the need for a more robust theoretical framework prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, its empirical insights and practical implications are commendable and position it as an impactful work within the research community.  **Score: 8**

### Pivoting Factorization: A Compact Meta Low-Rank Representation of Sparsity for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19090v1)
- **Authors**: Jialin Zhao, Yingtao Zhang, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci
- **Abstract**: The rapid growth of Large Language Models has driven demand for effective model compression techniques to reduce memory and computation costs. Low-rank pruning has gained attention for its tensor coherence and GPU compatibility across all densities. However, low-rank pruning has struggled to match the performance of semi-structured pruning, often doubling perplexity (PPL) at similar densities. In this paper, we propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), a novel lossless meta low-rank representation that unsupervisedly learns a compact form of any low-rank representation, effectively eliminating redundant information. PIFA identifies pivot rows (linearly independent rows) and expresses non-pivot rows as linear combinations, achieving an additional 24.2\% memory savings and 24.6\% faster inference over low-rank layers at r/d = 0.5, thereby significantly enhancing performance at the same density. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by low-rank pruning, we introduce a novel, retraining-free low-rank reconstruction method that minimizes error accumulation (M). MPIFA, combining M and PIFA into an end-to-end framework, significantly outperforms existing low-rank pruning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to semi-structured pruning, while surpassing it in GPU efficiency and compatibility.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper "Pivoting Factorization: A Compact Meta Low-Rank Representation of Sparsity for Efficient Inference in Large Language Models" addresses the challenges posed by the growing computational needs of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a novel method for model compression. The authors propose Pivoting Factorization (PIFA), which learns a compact and lossless representation of low-rank data by identifying pivot rows—linearly independent rows—and expressing other rows as combinations of these pivots. This approach reportedly leads to substantial memory savings (24.2%) and improves inference speed (24.6%) when applied to low-rank layers at a rank-to-dimension ratio (r/d) of 0.5. To overcome the performance drops commonly associated with low-rank pruning, an innovative retraining-free method that minimizes error accumulation is introduced. The combined approach, termed MPIFA, is shown to match the performance of semi-structured pruning while demonstrating superior GPU efficiency and compatibility, marking a significant step forward in the field of model compression for machine learning. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of Pivoting Factorization (PIFA) as a compact meta low-rank representation is a novel contribution. By unsupervised learning of compact forms and minimizing redundancy, the method presents a fresh perspective in compressing large models.    2. **Performance Improvement**: The reported memory and inference speed improvements signify a tangible enhancement over existing low-rank pruning techniques. Achieving performance comparable to semi-structured pruning with added GPU efficiency is commendable. 3. **Error Mitigation**: The novel method for retraining-free low-rank reconstruction that addresses error accumulation is particularly noteworthy, as error management is a critical concern in model pruning strategies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Scope**: While the improvements are impressive, the paper could benefit from a broader evaluation across varied models and datasets. Performance gains should be contextualized against a wider range of benchmarks to showcase generalizability. 2. **Thoughts on Practical Implications**: The relevance of the proposed methods in real-world applications could be explored in greater depth. Understanding trade-offs in different deployment scenarios might strengthen the paper’s impact. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The details regarding the implementation of the proposed technique are less elaborated. If PIFA and MPIFA are complex to integrate into existing frameworks, this could hinder adoption, and a clearer pathway to practical application would bolster the paper. **Overall Assessment**: The paper presents a significant step forward in model compression for LLMs, particularly with its unique methodologies and impressive results. However, the assessment of broader applicability and detailed implementation could enhance its value. Thus, while it makes a noteworthy contribution to the field, the impact is somewhat tempered by the identified areas for improvement. **Score: 7**

### Ambient Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Networks for Establishing Stochastic Object Models from Noisy Image Data
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19094v1)
- **Authors**: Xichen Xu, Wentao Chen, Weimin Zhou
- **Abstract**: It is widely accepted that medical imaging systems should be objectively assessed via task-based image quality (IQ) measures that ideally account for all sources of randomness in the measured image data, including the variation in the ensemble of objects to be imaged. Stochastic object models (SOMs) that can randomly draw samples from the object distribution can be employed to characterize object variability. To establish realistic SOMs for task-based IQ analysis, it is desirable to employ experimental image data. However, experimental image data acquired from medical imaging systems are subject to measurement noise. Previous work investigated the ability of deep generative models (DGMs) that employ an augmented generative adversarial network (GAN), AmbientGAN, for establishing SOMs from noisy measured image data. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have emerged as a leading DGM for image synthesis and can produce superior image quality than GANs. However, original DDMs possess a slow image-generation process because of the Gaussian assumption in the denoising steps. More recently, denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN) was proposed to permit fast image generation while maintain high generated image quality that is comparable to the original DDMs. In this work, we propose an augmented DDGAN architecture, Ambient DDGAN (ADDGAN), for learning SOMs from noisy image data. Numerical studies that consider clinical computed tomography (CT) images and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images are conducted. The ability of the proposed ADDGAN to learn realistic SOMs from noisy image data is demonstrated. It has been shown that the ADDGAN significantly outperforms the advanced AmbientGAN models for synthesizing high resolution medical images with complex textures.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces the Ambient Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Networks (ADDGAN), a novel architecture designed to construct stochastic object models (SOMs) from noisy medical image data. It emphasizes the importance of using task-based image quality measures that encompass all sources of randomness, including variations in the objects being imaged. To effectively model this randomness, the paper leverages the capabilities of a recent denoising diffusion GAN (DDGAN), which allows for rapid image generation while achieving high quality, outperforming existing models like AmbientGAN. Through numerical studies focused on clinical computed tomography (CT) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images, the authors demonstrate that ADDGAN successfully synthesizes high-resolution images with complex textures, showcasing its potential for enhancing the analysis of stochastic variability in medical imaging. ### Rigorous Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**: 1. **Innovation in Methodology**: The paper presents a significant advancement by introducing the ADDGAN architecture, which amalgamates the strengths of diffusion models and GANs. This combination is timely and relevant, as the field increasingly emphasizes the quality of synthetic image generation, particularly in a medical context where precision is critical. 2. **Addressing Noise in Medical Imaging**: By focusing on noisy experimental data common in medical imaging, the authors tackle a real-world problem, enhancing the functionality and applicability of generative models in a practical setting. 3. **Comparison to State-of-the-Art**: The study's comparative analysis showing that ADDGAN outperforms AmbientGAN adds to its credibility, highlighting its utility in generating high-quality images necessary for developing reliable SOMs. **Strengths**: - **Methodological Rigor**: The architecture is backed by thorough numerical experiments ensuring that claims about improved performance over previous models are substantiated. - **Contextual Relevance**: The application to medical imaging, where image quality and object variability are critical, enhances its significance in clinical settings. **Weaknesses**: - **Generalizability**: While the results for CT and DBT images are promising, the scope of tested applications could be expanded. The authors might need to validate the method against a broader array of imaging modalities to assert its versatility. - **Complexity**: The increased complexity of ADDGAN compared to simpler models might pose challenges in terms of computational resources and implementation in clinical practice. **Potential Influence**: The potential implications of the ADDGAN for medical imaging and diagnostic accuracy are considerable. However, broad adoption could be contingent upon the model’s ease of integration into existing imaging workflows and its adaptability to various imaging contexts. In conclusion, the novelty introduced by the ADDGAN, along with its significant enhancements over prior models in terms of image quality and synthesis speed, reflect a considerable leap forward in the field of medical image analysis. However, further validation and broadened applications must be explored for the approach to achieve widespread influence. **Score: 8**

### Brain-inspired sparse training enables Transformers and LLMs to perform as fully connected
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19107v1)
- **Authors**: Yingtao Zhang, Jialin Zhao, Wenjing Wu, Ziheng Liao, Umberto Michieli, Carlo Vittorio Cannistraci
- **Abstract**: This study aims to enlarge our current knowledge on application of brain-inspired network science principles for training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with sparse connectivity. Dynamic sparse training (DST) can reduce the computational demands in ANNs, but faces difficulties to keep peak performance at high sparsity levels. The Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is a brain-inspired method for growing connectivity in DST. CHT leverages a gradient-free, topology-driven link regrowth, which has shown ultra-sparse (1% connectivity or lower) advantage across various tasks compared to fully connected networks. Yet, CHT suffers two main drawbacks: (i) its time complexity is O(Nd^3) - N node network size, d node degree - hence it can apply only to ultra-sparse networks. (ii) it selects top link prediction scores, which is inappropriate for the early training epochs, when the network presents unreliable connections. We propose a GPU-friendly approximation of the CH link predictor, which reduces the computational complexity to O(N^3), enabling a fast implementation of CHT in large-scale models. We introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training soft rule (CHTs), which adopts a strategy for sampling connections in both link removal and regrowth, balancing the exploration and exploitation of network topology. To improve performance, we integrate CHTs with a sigmoid gradual density decay (CHTss). Empirical results show that, using 1% of connections, CHTs outperforms fully connected networks in MLP on visual classification tasks, compressing some networks to < 30% nodes. Using 5% of the connections, CHTss outperforms fully connected networks in two Transformer-based machine translation tasks. Using 30% of the connections, CHTss achieves superior performance compared to other dynamic sparse training methods in language modeling, and it surpasses the fully connected counterpart in zero-shot evaluations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a method for training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with sparse connectivity by utilizing brain-inspired techniques. The authors focus on dynamic sparse training (DST) and introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) method, which facilitates link regrowth in networks. While CHT has advantages in ultra-sparse settings, it is limited by high time complexity and the selection of top link predictions in early training phases. To address these issues, the authors propose a GPU-friendly approximation of the CHT that reduces computational complexity and introduce the Cannistraci-Hebb training soft rule (CHTs). This new approach balances the exploration and exploitation of network connections. Empirical results demonstrate that CHTs and its variant, CHTss, outperform fully connected networks in various tasks, including visual classification, machine translation, and language modeling, particularly when using significantly reduced connections. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in the integration of brain-inspired design principles into the sparse training of ANNs, particularly through the adaptation of the Cannistraci-Hebb framework. The transition from O(Nd^3) complexity to O(N^3) significantly enhances the feasibility of implementing sparse training in larger models, an aspect that could be transformative in fields that require efficiency, such as large-scale language models and Transformers. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The proposed CHTs and CHTss provide a fresh perspective on how sparse connectivity can be achieved without sacrificing performance, which is a critical area of research as networks grow larger. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper supports its claims with empirical results, showcasing a clear advantage of the proposed approaches over traditional fully connected networks. 3. **Computational Efficiency**: The reduction in computational complexity broadens the applicability of these methods, making them practical for real-world large-scale problems. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scalability Insight**: While the paper introduces new strategies, it does not extensively analyze their performance as network sizes or complexity continues to increase beyond current benchmarks. 2. **Generalization Across Tasks**: The empirical results focus mainly on specific tasks (visual classification, language modeling, and machine translation); the capabilities of the proposed methods in other areas or tasks remain less discussed. 3. **Complexity Analysis**: Although complexity has been reduced, O(N^3) may still present challenges for extremely large networks, and further optimization may be needed for scalability. **Potential Influence on the Field:** The implications of this work could be substantial, especially in scaling neural networks efficiently while leveraging sparse training. If followed up with broader applications and additional tasks, this method could significantly influence future architectural designs in deep learning. **Score: 8**  The paper presents a well-founded advancement in sparse training techniques and opens new avenues for research, but there are room for broader validation and scalability considerations to achieve higher impact. Overall, it makes a strong contribution to the domain.

- **Authors**: Sixiao Huang, Tintin Wang, Ang Li, Ao Shen, Kai Li, Keyao Jiang, Mingqiang Huang, Hao Yu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are both storage-intensive and computation-intensive, posing significant challenges when deployed on resource-constrained hardware. As linear layers in LLMs are mainly resource consuming parts, this paper develops a tensor-train decomposition (TTD) for LLMs with a further hardware implementation on FPGA. TTD compression is applied to the linear layers in ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models with compression ratios (CRs) for the whole network 1.94$\times$ and 1.60$\times$, respectively. The compressed LLMs are further implemented on FPGA hardware within a highly efficient group vector systolic array (GVSA) architecture, which has DSP-shared parallel vector PEs for TTD inference, as well as optimized data communication in the accelerator. Experimental results show that the corresponding TTD based LLM accelerator implemented on FPGA achieves 1.45$\times$ and 1.57$\times$ reduction in first token delay for ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B models, respectively.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach for compressing large language models (LLMs) using a tensor-train decomposition (TTD) method, aimed at addressing the significant storage and computation demands posed by such models when deployed on resource-constrained hardware. By applying TTD to the linear layers of ChatGLM3-6B and LLaMA2-7B, the researchers achieved compression ratios of 1.94x and 1.60x, respectively. These compressed models were implemented on FPGA hardware within an efficient group vector systolic array (GVSA) architecture, designed for optimizing data communication and parallel processing. Empirical results indicate that this FPGA implementation led to reductions in first token delay of 1.45x and 1.57x for the respective models, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed compression and hardware optimization techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its specific application of tensor-train decomposition to large language models, a topic of significant relevance given the increasing size of these models and the limitations of conventional hardware. By integrating this method with FPGA implementation through a specialized architecture (GVSA), the authors contribute to both the algorithmic and hardware aspects of LLM deployment. This double-pronged approach helps to bridge a gap in the field between model efficiency and hardware optimization, which is particularly welcome in low-resource settings. However, the paper could improve in several areas. For instance, it would benefit from a more thorough evaluation of the trade-offs between compression ratios and model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference quality). While the reductions in first token delay are noteworthy, the potential impacts on the model's output quality are not starkly addressed. Additionally, while the implementation on FPGAs adds practical significance, the paper lacks discussion on the broader applicability of this approach to other hardware platforms, which could limit its impact to niche applications only. Strengths of the paper include its practical relevance, empirical validation, and the innovative combination of methodologies. Conversely, weaknesses include a limited exploration of the implications of compression on model performance and inadequate discussion about the generalizability of the techniques.  Overall, the paper makes a solid contribution to the field of model compression and efficient deployment of large language models but lacks some depth in areas critical for full assessment of its broader significance. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a good level of novelty and practical contributions but emphasizes the need for further exploration of performance implications and broader applicability in future work.

### Imitation Game for Adversarial Disillusion with Multimodal Generative Chain-of-Thought Role-Play
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19143v1)
- **Authors**: Ching-Chun Chang, Fan-Yun Chen, Shih-Hong Gu, Kai Gao, Hanrui Wang, Isao Echizen
- **Abstract**: As the cornerstone of artificial intelligence, machine perception confronts a fundamental threat posed by adversarial illusions. These adversarial attacks manifest in two primary forms: deductive illusion, where specific stimuli are crafted based on the victim model's general decision logic, and inductive illusion, where the victim model's general decision logic is shaped by specific stimuli. The former exploits the model's decision boundaries to create a stimulus that, when applied, interferes with its decision-making process. The latter reinforces a conditioned reflex in the model, embedding a backdoor during its learning phase that, when triggered by a stimulus, causes aberrant behaviours. The multifaceted nature of adversarial illusions calls for a unified defence framework, addressing vulnerabilities across various forms of attack. In this study, we propose a disillusion paradigm based on the concept of an imitation game. At the heart of the imitation game lies a multimodal generative agent, steered by chain-of-thought reasoning, which observes, internalises and reconstructs the semantic essence of a sample, liberated from the classic pursuit of reversing the sample to its original state. As a proof of concept, we conduct experimental simulations using a multimodal generative dialogue agent and evaluates the methodology under a variety of attack scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Imitation Game for Adversarial Disillusion with Multimodal Generative Chain-of-Thought Role-Play" addresses the critical issue of adversarial illusions in machine perception, which can lead to erroneous decision-making in artificial intelligence models. It differentiates between two main types of adversarial attacks: deductive illusions that exploit decision boundaries and inductive illusions that embed backdoors during learning. The authors propose a unified defense framework leveraging an imitation game, involving a multimodal generative agent that employs chain-of-thought reasoning. This new approach emphasizes understanding and reconstructing the semantic essence of input stimuli, rather than purely reversing them. The authors validate their methodology through experimental simulations on a multimodal generative dialogue agent across diverse attack scenarios. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces a novel approach to addressing adversarial threats in AI through the lens of an imitation game, which is relatively unexplored in the context of adversarial disillusion. This framework not only categorizes the types of adversarial attacks but also suggests a method to counteract them, providing a comprehensive perspective that could enrich the existing literature. The introduction of multimodal generative agents combined with chain-of-thought reasoning represents an innovative twist, implying potential enhancements in model resilience against attacks. Strengths: - The clear distinction between deductive and inductive illusions contributes valuable insights to the understanding of adversarial attacks. - The concept of integrating multimodal understanding with generative modeling and reasoning is a significant step forward in the domain. - The experimental validation serves as a strong foundation for the proposed concept, suggesting practical applicability. Weaknesses: - While the theoretical framework is compelling, the experimental results presented need to be thoroughly scrutinized for robustness and replicability. - The practical implications and integration of the proposed models within existing systems are not sufficiently explored. - Additional comparisons with current state-of-the-art methods that tackle similar adversarial issues are absent, which would strengthen the argument for the proposed paradigm. Considering the paper's contributions, it presents a significant yet early-stage development in the field of AI robustness against adversarial illusions. It lays groundwork for future research, but its immediate impact on current practices remains to be demonstrated through additional rigorous experiments and real-world applications. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, the efficient utilization of spectrum resources, optimization of communication quality, and intelligent communication have become critical. Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse data hinder accurate reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose the **Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM)**, a physics-informed framework that integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to incorporate constraints like the **Helmholtz equation**. RMDM employs a dual U-Net architecture: the first ensures physical consistency by minimizing PDE residuals, boundary conditions, and source constraints, while the second refines predictions via diffusion-based denoising. By leveraging physical laws, RMDM significantly enhances accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RMDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** and **RMSE of 0.0125** under the Static RM (SRM) setting, and **NMSE of 0.0047** and **RMSE of 0.0146** under the Dynamic RM (DRM) setting. These results establish a novel paradigm for integrating physics-informed and data-driven approaches in radio map reconstruction, particularly under sparse data conditions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**  The paper presents the Radio Map Diffusion Model (RMDM), a novel framework aimed at enhancing radio map reconstruction amidst the challenges posed by complex signal propagation and limited data. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), RMDM incorporates physical constraints, specifically the Helmholtz equation, during the reconstruction process. The architecture employs dual U-Net configurations: the first focuses on ensuring physical consistency by minimizing partial differential equation (PDE) residuals and enforcing boundary conditions, while the second optimizes predictions through a diffusion-based denoising mechanism. Experimental evaluations of the model indicate that RMDM yields superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving low normalized mean square error (NMSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) values in both static and dynamic radio map settings. This research highlights the effective fusion of physics-informed and data-driven strategies for addressing sparse data challenges in radio map reconstruction. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the RMDM lies in its integration of physical principles with modern neural network architectures, specifically leveraging PINNs for radio map reconstruction. This approach offers a significant advancement over traditional purely data-driven methods, especially in scenarios where data is sparse. The application of dual U-Net architectures is an innovative strategy that not only enforces physical consistency but also refines model accuracy through a structured denoising process. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of physical laws with deep learning represents a compelling direction in the field, addressing fundamental issues in data-sparse environments. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The rigorous experimentation demonstrates tangible improvements in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, substantiating the proposed method's effectiveness. 3. **Potential Impact:** Given the growing reliance on wireless communication technologies, a robust and accurate radio map reconstruction method has substantial implications for a range of applications. However, there are some weaknesses and limitations: 1. **Domain Specificity:** While the integration of physics is a step forward, the model's dependence on specific physical constraints (like the Helmholtz equation) may limit its applicability across diverse scenarios outside the designated frameworks. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The dual U-Net architecture and the integration of physics constraints may introduce significant complexities in implementation and training, impacting the accessibility of the model for practitioners in the field. 3. **Future Work Needed:** The results are promising, yet further exploration is required to evaluate the model’s performance in more varied or realistic environments beyond the experiment's confines. In conclusion, while the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of radio map reconstruction by effectively marrying physics with data-driven approaches, its dependency on particular physical models might restrict its broader applicability. The positive empirical results present a strong case for adoption but raise concerns about generalization.  **Score: 8**

### Poison as Cure: Visual Noise for Mitigating Object Hallucinations in LVMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19164v1)
- **Authors**: Kejia Zhang, Keda Tao, Jiasheng Tang, Huan Wang
- **Abstract**: Large vision-language models (LVMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with visual perception capabilities, enabling them to process and interpret visual information. A major challenge compromising their reliability is object hallucination that LVMs may generate plausible but factually inaccurate information. We propose a novel visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) method to mitigate this hallucination issue. VAP alleviates LVM hallucination by applying strategically optimized visual noise without altering the base model. Our approach formulates hallucination suppression as an optimization problem, leveraging adversarial strategies to generate beneficial visual perturbations that enhance the model's factual grounding and reduce parametric knowledge bias. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently reduces object hallucinations across 8 state-of-the-art LVMs, validating its efficacy across diverse evaluations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Poison as Cure: Visual Noise for Mitigating Object Hallucinations in LVMs" addresses a significant challenge in large vision-language models (LVMs), which is the phenomenon of object hallucination—where these models produce incorrect yet plausible information related to visual inputs. The authors introduce a method called visual adversarial perturbation (VAP) that strategically applies visual noise to the input images to reduce these hallucinations without needing to modify the underlying LVM architecture. By framing the suppression of hallucinations as an optimization problem, VAP generates visual perturbations that serve to ground the model's outputs in factual reality and minimize biases rooted in the model’s learned parameters. The results of extensive experiments showcase that VAP effectively reduces object hallucinations across eight leading LVMs, confirming its robustness and versatility. --- **Critical Evaluation:** Novelty: The approach presented in this paper stands out due to its innovative use of visual adversarial perturbations—an area that has seen increasing interest as a way to enhance the robustness of machine learning models. While the idea of using adversarial techniques to modify inputs is not entirely new, applying it specifically to reduce hallucinations in LVMs is a valuable contribution that addresses a pressing issue in the field.  Significance: The significance of addressing hallucinations in LVMs cannot be overstated, as these models have broad applications in areas like autonomous driving, medical imaging, and content generation, where factual accuracy is critical. Given the increasing deployment of LVMs in practical applications, the ability to mitigate hallucinations could have substantial implications for trust and safety in AI systems. Strengths:  - The methodology is well-formulated, and the optimization approach provides a clear framework for generating the visual perturbations. - The experimental results are robust, covering multiple state-of-the-art LVMs and demonstrating consistent improvements in fixed settings. - The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and thorough results discussion, which aids in replicability and understanding. Weaknesses: - While the method shows promise, the paper does not thoroughly discuss potential limitations, such as scenarios in which VAP may fail to eliminate hallucinations or could inadvertently generate misleading representations. - The paper could benefit from more detailed comparisons with other existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations, to better contextualize its contributions and improvements. - Finally, potential ethical implications of adversarial perturbations, especially in sensitive applications, are not addressed. Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the community working on LVMs by providing a tangible method for tackling a prevalent and problematic issue—object hallucination. However, the limitations and broader context of the solution should be explored further. Score: 8

### Position: Contextual Integrity Washing for Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19173v1)
- **Authors**: Yan Shvartzshnaider, Vasisht Duddu
- **Abstract**: Machine learning community is discovering Contextual Integrity (CI) as a useful framework to assess the privacy implications of large language models (LLMs). This is an encouraging development. The CI theory emphasizes sharing information in accordance with privacy norms and can bridge the social, legal, political, and technical aspects essential for evaluating privacy in LLMs. However, this is also a good point to reflect on use of CI for LLMs. This position paper argues that existing literature adopts CI for LLMs without embracing the theory's fundamental tenets, essentially amounting to a form of "CI-washing." CI-washing could lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed privacy-preserving designs. We clarify the four fundamental tenets of CI theory, systematize prior work on whether they deviate from these tenets, and highlight overlooked issues in experimental hygiene for LLMs (e.g., prompt sensitivity, positional bias).
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Position: Contextual Integrity Washing for Language Models" critiques the current approach within the machine learning community regarding the application of Contextual Integrity (CI) theory to assess the privacy implications of large language models (LLMs). It highlights a prevalent trend of "CI-washing," where researchers employ the CI framework superficially, without adhering to its core principles, leading to misleading conclusions and suboptimal privacy designs. The authors elucidate the four fundamental tenets of CI, analyze existing literature to identify deviations from these principles, and bring attention to issues related to experimental methodology in studying LLMs, such as prompt sensitivity and positional bias. The paper aims to provide a more rigorous framework for evaluating the privacy of LLMs, urging the community to avoid CI-washing and adhere more closely to CI theory. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**:  This paper brings an important and timely critique of how Contextual Integrity is being applied (or misapplied) to LLMs, a critical area of focus given the growing concerns surrounding the privacy implications of AI technologies. The authors' focus on "CI-washing" introduces a novel concept that can encourage more rigorous application of privacy theories to LLMs. By systematically addressing how existing research diverges from CI principles, the paper contributes significantly to the conversation about ethical AI and privacy. **Strengths**: - The identification of "CI-washing" as a concept highlights an important issue in the field, encouraging deeper scrutiny of AI privacy assessments. - The clarification of the four tenets of CI provides a structured framework for future research and can guide practitioners in better aligning their work with CI theory. - The emphasis on methodological rigor encourages higher standards in experimental designs studying LLMs, promoting more reliable findings. **Weaknesses**: - While the critiques are relevant, the paper might benefit from more specific examples of prior works that exemplify CI-washing to bolster its arguments. - The call for improved experimental hygiene is crucial but lacks concrete recommendations or guidelines, which could help practitioners implement these changes. - The scope may be perceived as somewhat narrow, focusing heavily on the theory without extensively exploring practical implications or solutions. Overall, the paper has a strong foundation in highlighting an oversight in the application of crucial privacy principles to LLMs. Its critique of existing approaches is both timely and necessary, aiming to provoke thought and change in ongoing research. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's important contribution to ongoing discussions about AI ethics and privacy, but acknowledges the potential for further development and practical guidance that could enhance the impact of its findings.

### Enhancing Model Defense Against Jailbreaks with Proactive Safety Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19180v1)
- **Authors**: Xianglin Yang, Gelei Deng, Jieming Shi, Tianwei Zhang, Jin Song Dong
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are vital for a wide range of applications yet remain susceptible to jailbreak threats, which could lead to the generation of inappropriate responses. Conventional defenses, such as refusal and adversarial training, often fail to cover corner cases or rare domains, leaving LLMs still vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks. We propose a novel defense strategy, Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which harnesses the enhanced \textit{reasoning capabilities} of LLMs for proactive assessment of harmful inputs, rather than simply blocking them. SCoT augments any refusal training datasets to critically analyze the intent behind each request before generating answers. By employing proactive reasoning, SCoT enhances the generalization of LLMs across varied harmful queries and scenarios not covered in the safety alignment corpus. Additionally, it generates detailed refusals specifying the rules violated. Comparative evaluations show that SCoT significantly surpasses existing defenses, reducing vulnerability to out-of-distribution issues and adversarial manipulations while maintaining strong general capabilities.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper addresses a significant vulnerability in large language models (LLMs) to jailbreak threats, which can result in the generation of harmful or inappropriate outputs. Traditional defense mechanisms, such as refusal responses and adversarial training, often fall short, particularly in novel or rare scenarios. The authors introduce a new defense strategy named Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), which leverages the reasoning abilities of LLMs for proactive assessment of potentially harmful inputs instead of merely denying them. SCoT enhances existing refusal training datasets by enabling models to analyze the intent behind user requests more deeply and aligns responses with the specific rules violated, thus improving the overall safety and generalization of LLMs. Comparative experiments indicate that SCoT outperforms conventional defenses by effectively mitigating risks associated with out-of-distribution and adversarial inputs while preserving the model's functional capabilities. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The introduction of Safety Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) is a step forward in addressing the limitations of existing defenses against jailbreaks in LLMs. The proactive approach of analyzing intent rather than just blocking harmful inputs marks a shift towards enhancing the model's reasoning process. While the paper draws from established ideas in LLM safety and adversarial training, its emphasis on a reasoning-based defense mechanism provides a nuanced contribution to the literature. However, the novelty might be constrained since the notion of proactive reasoning is not entirely new in AI safety research. **Significance:** The significance of this paper lies in its potential to substantially improve the robustness and safety of LLMs in real-world applications, where the consequences of jailbreak threats can have considerable implications. The empirical evaluation adds credibility to the proposed approach, showing a marked reduction in vulnerabilities compared to standard methods. Additionally, the detailed refusals generated by SCoT could enhance user understanding and align expectations about model capabilities. **Strengths:** 1. **Proactive Defense Strategy:** SCoT's focus on understanding user intent enhances the chance for the model to prevent harmful responses effectively. 2. **Evaluation Results:** The comparative analysis provides evidence that SCoT can significantly outperform existing methods, a strong point for its adoption. 3. **Applicability:** The method can be integrated into various LLM architectures, making it flexible and relevant across different applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Coverage:** While SCoT enhances generalization, it may still struggle with edge cases or entirely novel jailbreaking methods that are not adequately represented in training datasets. 2. **Complexity:** The introduction of a reasoning layer adds complexity, which might complicate the model's interpretability and deployment requirements. 3. **Implementation Concerns:** The practical implications of integrating SCoT into existing systems and assessing its computational impact remain unclear. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents a compelling and innovative approach to enhancing LLM defenses against jailbreaks, with significant implications for the safety and reliability of AI systems. While it showcases strengths in addressing an urgent issue, the ongoing challenges of edge case handling and implementation detail suggest that further research is needed. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a balance between the novelty of the proactive reasoning strategy and its practical implications for safety, tempered by the need for more extensive validation in diverse scenarios. The contribution is notable but does not fully transcend existing frameworks, thereby warranting a score that recognizes both its promise and its limitations.

- **Authors**: Xuan Shen, Yizhou Wang, Xiangxi Shi, Yanzhi Wang, Pu Zhao, Jiuxiang Gu
- **Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has become a powerful framework for improving complex problem-solving capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, the verbose nature of textual reasoning introduces significant inefficiencies. In this work, we propose $\textbf{Heima}$ (as hidden llama), an efficient reasoning framework that leverages reasoning CoTs at hidden latent space. We design the Heima Encoder to condense each intermediate CoT into a compact, higher-level hidden representation using a single thinking token, effectively minimizing verbosity and reducing the overall number of tokens required during the reasoning process. Meanwhile, we design corresponding Heima Decoder with traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) to adaptively interpret the hidden representations into variable-length textual sequence, reconstructing reasoning processes that closely resemble the original CoTs. Experimental results across diverse reasoning MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that Heima model achieves higher generation efficiency while maintaining or even better zero-shot task accuracy. Moreover, the effective reconstruction of multimodal reasoning processes with Heima Decoder validates both the robustness and interpretability of our approach.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Efficient Reasoning with Hidden Thinking" introduces a new framework called Heima, which aims to enhance the reasoning efficiency of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) while preserving or improving their performance. The proposed Heima framework employs a novel Heima Encoder that condenses Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into compact hidden representations using a single thinking token, thereby reducing verbosity and token counts during the reasoning process. Complementing this, the Heima Decoder is designed to convert these hidden representations back into textual sequences that mimic the original CoTs. The authors provide experimental results demonstrating that the Heima model outperforms traditional methods in terms of generation efficiency while maintaining or exceeding zero-shot task accuracy. Furthermore, the effective reconstruction of multimodal reasoning processes with the Heima Decoder highlights the approach's robustness and interpretability. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper presents a notable shift in the reasoning framework for MLLMs by targeting the verbosity commonly associated with Chain-of-Thought reasoning. By introducing the Heima Encoder and Decoder, the authors have created a mechanism that optimizes the reasoning process while maintaining clarity and interpretability. The approach of representing complex reasoning tasks in a more compact format is innovative and could serve as a foundation for further advancements in the field. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Efficiency:** The primary strength of the paper lies in its approach to reduce inefficiencies in reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, a known challenge in the MLLM domain. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The authors provide experimental data that demonstrates the effectiveness of Heima across multiple benchmarks, which adds credibility to their claims and showcases practical applicability. 3. **Robustness and Interpretability:** By focusing on reconstruction and interpretability, the paper addresses critical concerns in deploying AI—and specifically MLLMs—in real-world applications where understanding the reasoning process is essential. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of Results:** While the results demonstrate improved efficiency and accuracy, it would be beneficial to see a wider variety of benchmarks and potentially real-world applications to fully assess the robustness of Heima. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The addition of a new architecture (Heima Encoder and Decoder) may introduce complexity in implementation, which could limit adoption in certain environments. **Significance:** Overall, this paper is significant as it attempts to bridge gaps between efficiency and interpretability in reasoning processes. It addresses a pressing challenge in AI communication and processing efficiency, suggesting pathways for future research and application in AI systems. Given the novelty, sound experimental validation, and relevance of the contributions, I would rate this paper a **Score: 8**.

- **Abstract**: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for autonomous code generation is gaining attention in emerging technologies. As LLM capabilities expand, they offer new possibilities such as code refactoring, security enhancements, and legacy application upgrades. Many outdated web applications pose security and reliability challenges, yet companies continue using them due to the complexity and cost of upgrades. To address this, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent system that autonomously upgrades legacy web applications to the latest versions. The system distributes tasks across multiple phases, updating all relevant files. To evaluate its effectiveness, we employed Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts, applying identical instructions in both cases. The evaluation involved updating view files and measuring the number and types of errors in the output. For complex tasks, we counted the successfully met requirements. The experiments compared the proposed system with standalone LLM execution, repeated multiple times to account for stochastic behavior. Results indicate that our system maintains context across tasks and agents, improving solution quality over the base model in some cases. This study provides a foundation for future model implementations in legacy code updates. Additionally, findings highlight LLMs' ability to update small outdated files with high precision, even with basic prompts. The source code is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/alasalm1/Multi-agent-pipeline.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper proposes a novel approach for upgrading legacy web applications using a multi-agent system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary challenge addressed is the complexity and cost associated with upgrading outdated web applications, which often pose security and reliability risks.

### Strassen Attention: Unlocking Compositional Abilities in Transformers Based on a New Lower Bound Method
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19215v1)
- **Authors**: Alexander Kozachinskiy, Felipe Urrutia, Hector Jimenez, Tomasz Steifer, Germán Pizarro, Matías Fuentes, Francisco Meza, Cristian Buc, Cristóbal Rojas
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel method to evaluate the theoretical limits of Transformers, allowing us to prove the first lower bounds against one-layer softmax Transformers with infinite precision. We establish those bounds for three tasks that require advanced reasoning. The first task, Match3 (Sanford et al., 2023), requires looking at all triples of positions. The second and third tasks address compositionality-based reasoning: one is composition of functions (Peng et al., 2024) and the other is composition of binary relations. We formally prove the inability of one-layer softmax Transformers to solve any of these tasks. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we introduce Strassen attention and prove that with this mechanism a one-layer Transformer can in principle solve all these tasks. We also show that it enjoys sub-cubic running-time complexity, making it more scalable than similar previously proposed mechanisms, such as higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023). To complement our theoretical findings, we experimentally studied Strassen attention and compared it against standard (Vaswani et al, 2017), higher-order attention (Sanford et al., 2023) and triangular attention (Bergen et al. 2021). Our results help to disentangle all these attention mechanisms, highlighting their strengths and limitations. In particular, Strassen attention outperforms standard attention significantly on all the tasks. Altogether, understanding the theoretical limitations can guide research towards scalable attention mechanisms that improve the reasoning abilities of Transformers.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Strassen Attention: Unlocking Compositional Abilities in Transformers Based on a New Lower Bound Method" presents a new evaluation method for the theoretical limits of Transformers, particularly one-layer softmax Transformers with infinite precision. The authors establish lower bounds for three advanced reasoning tasks—Match3, function composition, and binary relation composition—demonstrating that these Transformers are incapable of solving any of these tasks. To address these limitations, the authors introduce a new mechanism called Strassen attention, which allows a one-layer Transformer to theoretically solve all tasks with improved efficiency, achieving sub-cubic running-time complexity. The authors compare Strassen attention against existing mechanisms like standard attention, higher-order attention, and triangular attention, highlighting its significant performance advantage across tasks. They argue that understanding the theoretical constraints can steer future research toward developing more scalable attention mechanisms that enhance Transformer reasoning abilities. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  The paper introduces a significant innovation by providing the first formal lower bounds on the reasoning capabilities of one-layer softmax Transformers. While attention mechanisms are well-studied, the rigorous approach to proving limits and the introduction of Strassen attention represents a noteworthy contribution to the theoretical understanding of Transformers. The proposal of Strassen attention itself is intriguing as it claims to enhance compositional reasoning in Transformers, a critical area for improving their capability. **Significance:** This work is significant because it bridges theoretical limits and practical performance, proposing solutions to address known shortcomings in Transformer architectures. The mechanism not only theoretical but also demonstrates practical improvements in performance metrics through empirical validation against competing mechanisms. By elucidating the strengths and weaknesses of various attention mechanisms, this paper could guide future research, making its implications potentially far-reaching. **Strengths:** 1. The methodology is rigorous, providing formal proofs where appropriate. 2. The empirical results substantiate the theoretical claims and highlight the effectiveness of Strassen attention. 3. The study addresses meaningful tasks in the context of compositional reasoning, which is highly relevant in fields like natural language processing and computer vision. **Weaknesses:** 1. The paper could elaborate more on the limitations or constraints of using Strassen attention in real-world applications, as theoretical advantages do not always translate into practical performance gains. 2. While the new method offers lower bounds, broader implications in multi-layer or more complex Transformers could be explored. 3. The study might benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of existing literature on attention mechanisms to clearly position its contributions relative to earlier works. **Overall Impression:** This paper effectively tackles an important problem in Transformer models, presenting foundational theoretical work while proposing a new mechanism that promises practical benefits. Its rigor and relevance in pushing the boundaries of what Transformers can do support its claim to novelty and significance, though some areas for improvement remain. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's solid contribution to understanding Transformer limitations and its innovative approach through Strassen attention, while acknowledging that there are still aspects that could be further explored and clarified.

### A Zero-Shot Generalization Framework for LLM-Driven Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19232v1)
- **Authors**: Yunzhe Li, Junting Wang, Hari Sundaram, Zhining Liu
- **Abstract**: Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without the need for additional training or fine-tuning, making it particularly valuable in data-sparse environments where traditional models struggle. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved ZCDSR by leveraging rich pretrained representations to facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer. However, a key challenge persists: domain semantic bias, which arises from variations in vocabulary and content focus across domains. This misalignment leads to inconsistencies in item embeddings and hinders generalization. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework designed to enhance LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that promotes inter-domain compactness by aligning embeddings of similar items across domains while maintaining intra-domain diversity to preserve unique item characteristics. This prevents embeddings from becoming overly generic while ensuring effective transferability. At the sequential level, we develop a method for transferring user behavioral patterns by clustering user sequences in the source domain and applying attention-based aggregation for target domain inference. This dynamic adaptation of user embeddings allows effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and domains demonstrate that our framework significantly improves sequential recommendation performance in the ZCDSR setting. By mitigating domain bias and enhancing the transferability of sequential patterns, our method provides a scalable and robust approach for achieving more effective zero-shot recommendations across domains.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a framework aimed at improving zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) by addressing domain semantic bias, which affects the effectiveness of recommendations when the target domain has different vocabulary or content focus. The authors leverage advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance the transferability of knowledge across unseen domains. Their approach involves two main contributions: (1) a generalization loss at the item level that fosters alignment of similar item embeddings across domains while preserving unique item characteristics, and (2) an attentional user sequence aggregation method for the sequential level that allows the effective adaptation of user embeddings for predictions in the target domain without needing prior interactions. Empirical evaluations using multiple datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly improve sequential recommendation performance in ZCDSR settings by mitigating domain bias and enhancing transferability. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a notable advancement in the field of recommendation systems, particularly within the context of zero-shot learning and cross-domain applications. The use of large language models for improving ZCDSR is timely and relevant, capitalizing on recent advances in deep learning. The proposed generalization loss and user behavior aggregation methods represent novel contributions that tackle the well-known challenge of domain semantic bias, a crucial factor in cross-domain recommendations. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Critical Issue**: The paper identifies and addresses the genuine challenge of domain semantic bias, which impacts performance in sequential recommendation systems. This focus is particularly important in real-world scenarios where data sparsity is prevalent. 2. **Methodological Innovation**: Introducing a generalization loss function that balances inter-domain alignment with intra-domain diversity is a significant methodological contribution. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The extensive empirical evidences presented across varied datasets highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods, reinforcing its practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Scalability**: While the methods are theoretically robust, the added complexity of the framework may pose scalability challenges, especially in real-time systems where quick recommendations are necessary. 2. **Potential Overfitting**: There is a risk that the proposed embeddings, despite efforts to avoid genericity, could lead to overfitting if the underlying features of the embeddings are not appropriately managed across diverse domains. 3. **Limited Exploration of LLMs**: While the integration of LLMs is a strength, the paper could delve deeper into how different architectures or configurations of LLMs might influence performance across various domains. Overall, this paper significantly contributes to the field by providing practical solutions to a pressing problem in sequential recommendations, showcasing innovative approaches to leveraging LLMs in a zero-shot context. The insights derived from this study could prompt further research into domain adaptation techniques and deep learning in recommendation systems. **Score: 8**  The score reflects its innovative approach and practical implications while acknowledging the challenges concerning scalability and complexity in real-world applications. The contributions are valuable, but further validation and exploration of the proposed methods is needed to confirm their effectiveness across broader scenarios.

### Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19252v1)
- **Authors**: Yuta Oshima, Masahiro Suzuki, Yutaka Matsuo, Hiroki Furuta
- **Abstract**: The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables photorealistic generations, although the contents of the generated video often include unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some quantity on the goodness of the content. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward, at inference time. We then point out that the improvement of perceptual video quality considering the alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. When evaluating outputs by using vision language models as a proxy of humans, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with evaluation and also depend on the degree of dynamic descriptions in evaluation prompts. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality based on the calibrated reward, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling. We provide practical guidelines on which axes, among search budget, lookahead steps for reward estimate, and denoising steps, in the reverse diffusion process, we should allocate the inference-time computation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Inference-Time Text-to-Video Alignment with Diffusion Latent Beam Search" addresses the challenges in generating coherent and high-quality videos from text descriptions using diffusion models. Despite advancements in generating photorealistic videos, issues such as unnatural movements and static scenes persist. The authors propose a novel method called diffusion latent beam search with a lookahead estimator aimed at optimizing the alignment of generated videos with textual prompts during inference time.  Key contributions include a framework for selecting the best diffusion latents based on an alignment reward, which is further refined by calibrating existing metrics to better reflect perceptual video quality. The study critiques the limitations of previous metrics, highlighting their dependence on the dynamic nature of the prompts used for evaluation. The proposed method significantly enhances perceptual quality without needing to update model parameters, outperforming conventional strategies like greedy search. Practical guidelines for optimizing computation during the inference process are also presented. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The approach of leveraging alignment metrics during the inference phase to enhance the output quality of text-to-video models is a notable contribution. While previous work has focused on model training and architecture improvements, the authors bring a fresh perspective by addressing the practical aspects of inference-time optimization. The introduction of a lookahead estimator further adds to the novel aspect of the methodology, distinguishing it from existing approaches that solely rely on traditional sampling methods. **Significance:** Given the increasing interest in text-to-video generation and the prevalence of generative models in AI research, the proposed method has the potential to substantially impact the field. By enhancing the perceptual quality of videos generated, this research could facilitate better applications in entertainment, education, and content creation. However, it is essential to consider that the improvements depend heavily on a careful calibration of existing metrics, which may present a limitation if the metrics used are not widely accepted in the community. **Strengths:** - The integration of a lookahead mechanism to improve latent selection represents a significant advancement in inference methodologies. - The authors provide practical guidelines that could help practitioners optimize their processes, increasing the paper's relevance to industry applications. - Empirical validation against existing methods demonstrates a meaningful improvement in video quality. **Weaknesses:** - The reliance on vision-language models as proxies for human evaluation may introduce biases, as these models cannot perfectly capture human perceptual judgement. - The calibration of metrics, while necessary, raises concerns about the reproducibility of results across different contexts or datasets if the alignment metrics are not universally applicable. In conclusion, while the paper presents a robust and innovative method for improving text-to-video generation quality, the impact may be somewhat moderated by the challenges associated with metric calibration and evaluation. Nevertheless, the proposal shows considerable promise for advancing the field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's clear contributions to addressing a pertinent challenge in text-to-video generation, while acknowledging the areas that require further exploration.

- **Authors**: Mian Muhammad Naeem Abid, Nancy Mehta, Zongwei Wu, Fayaz Ali Dharejo, Radu Timofte
- **Abstract**: Semantic segmentation assigns labels to pixels in images, a critical yet challenging task in computer vision. Convolutional methods, although capturing local dependencies well, struggle with long-range relationships. Vision Transformers (ViTs) excel in global context capture but are hindered by high computational demands, especially for high-resolution inputs. Most research optimizes the encoder architecture, leaving the bottleneck underexplored - a key area for enhancing performance and efficiency. We propose ContextFormer, a hybrid framework leveraging the strengths of CNNs and ViTs in the bottleneck to balance efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for real-time semantic segmentation. The framework's efficiency is driven by three synergistic modules: the Token Pyramid Extraction Module (TPEM) for hierarchical multi-scale representation, the Transformer and Modulating DepthwiseConv (Trans-MDC) block for dynamic scale-aware feature modeling, and the Feature Merging Module (FMM) for robust integration with enhanced spatial and contextual consistency. Extensive experiments on ADE20K, Pascal Context, CityScapes, and COCO-Stuff datasets show ContextFormer significantly outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art mIoU scores, setting a new benchmark for efficiency and performance. The codes will be made publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces ContextFormer, a hybrid framework aimed at improving efficiency in semantic segmentation by combining the advantages of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

- **Authors**: Amogh Joshi, Sourav Sanyal, Kaushik Roy
- **Abstract**: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces Neuro-LIFT, an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and neuromorphic vision systems for autonomous drone navigation. It addresses the limitations of traditional NLP systems in understanding context and intent, thereby enhancing human-drone interactions. By using a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor with event-based cameras and spiking neural networks, Neuro-LIFT enables real-time, energy-efficient navigation, where human commands translated into high-level planning can be autonomously executed. The framework demonstrates the capability to navigate dynamically, avoid obstacles, and respond to human instructions effectively. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper carries significant novelty and relevance, tackling a pressing issue in robotic navigation—combining intuitive human interactions with rapid decision-making capabilities necessary for autonomous systems. The integration of NLP with neuromorphic vision is particularly noteworthy because it addresses the energy consumption and latency challenges prevalent in traditional systems. By demonstrating real-world applicability through a physical drone platform, the authors showcase an advancement that could enhance both human-robot interaction and autonomous navigation systems in dynamic environments. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Approach:** The fusion of LLMs with neuromorphic vision systems is a forward-thinking solution aligning with current trends in AI and robotics. 2. **Real-World Application:** Implementation on a physical drone provides valuable insights into practical challenges and solutions in the field. 3. **Timely Contribution:** The exploration of human-intuitive interaction models is crucial as more industries adopt autonomous systems. Weaknesses to consider: 1. **Experimental Limitations:** The scope of experiments and real-world scenarios tested might be limited, raising questions about generalizability. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a more extensive comparison with existing technologies to better delineate advantages. 3. **Scalability Issues:** While the implementation shows promise, the scalability of the approach to various environments or drone types has not been discussed in detail. Overall, while the paper presents strong advancements, its practical implications might still be in the pilot phase, and further validation will be necessary to truly assess its impact on the field. Given these considerations, the paper contributes valuable insights yet requires more robustness in experimental breadth to fully impact the community. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in deep learning have shown that learning robust feature representations is critical for the success of many computer vision tasks, including medical image segmentation. In particular, both transformer and convolutional-based architectures have benefit from leveraging pretext tasks for pretraining. However, the adoption of pretext tasks in 3D medical imaging has been less explored and remains a challenge, especially in the context of learning generalizable feature representations. We propose a novel pretraining strategy using diffusion models with anatomical guidance, tailored to the intricacies of 3D medical image data. We introduce an auxiliary diffusion process to pretrain a model that produce generalizable feature representations, useful for a variety of downstream segmentation tasks. We employ an additional model that predicts 3D universal body-part coordinates, providing guidance during the diffusion process and improving spatial awareness in generated representations. This approach not only aids in resolving localization inaccuracies but also enriches the model's ability to understand complex anatomical structures. Empirical validation on a 13-class organ segmentation task demonstrate the effectiveness of our pretraining technique. It surpasses existing restorative pretraining methods in 3D medical image segmentation by $7.5\%$, and is competitive with the state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining approach, achieving an average Dice coefficient of 67.8 in a non-linear evaluation scenario.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a new pretraining strategy for medical semantic segmentation that utilizes diffusion models, complemented by anatomical guidance, specially designed for 3D medical imaging. The authors highlight the challenge of adopting pretext tasks for pretraining in this context and propose an auxiliary diffusion process that enhances the model's ability to learn generalizable feature representations for downstream segmentation tasks. This method also incorporates a model that predicts 3D universal body-part coordinates to improve spatial awareness and localization during the diffusion process, thereby aiding in the understanding of complex anatomical structures. The proposed approach was empirically validated against a 13-class organ segmentation task, demonstrating a significant improvement over existing restoration pretraining methods, with a performance increase of 7.5%, and competitiveness with state-of-the-art contrastive pretraining methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of 67.8 in a non-linear evaluation scenario. --- ### Critical Evaluation The paper demonstrates a significant contribution to the field of medical image segmentation by addressing a pivotal gap in the literature regarding the use of pretext tasks in 3D medical contexts. Notably, the innovative application of diffusion models, which are increasingly recognized for their potential in generative tasks, sets this work apart from traditional approaches. The integration of anatomical guidance further enhances the model's understanding of the data, which is a valuable advancement in anatomy-aware machine learning. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The use of diffusion models for pretraining in 3D medical imaging is relatively under-explored, and this paper opens new avenues for applying generative models in medical settings. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of their approach, surpassing existing methods by a substantial margin, which lends credibility to their claims. 3. **Focus on Localization and Anatomical Structure:** By addressing localization inaccuracies and incorporating anatomical structures, the paper contributes to improving the interpretability and performance of segmentation models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Experiments:** While the authors validate their method on a 13-class organ segmentation task, the generalizability of the approach across diverse types of medical images and clinical scenarios could be further investigated. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed method's reliance on additional models for anatomical guidance may complicate its implementation in practical settings compared to simpler models, which could limit its adoption. 3. **Comparative Baselines:** Although the results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with a broader range of pretraining strategies, including those which have not been highlighted. **Potential Influence on the Field:** Given the increasing interest in self-supervised learning techniques and generative models, this work has the potential to influence future research by encouraging the exploration of innovative pretraining strategies in medical imaging. The methodology could inspire further studies focused on understanding anatomical context and improving localization in medical AI applications. ### Score: 8 The score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to the field, especially in its methodical approach to using diffusion models for pretraining in medical image segmentation.

### Jackpot! Alignment as a Maximal Lottery
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19266v1)
- **Authors**: Roberto-Rafael Maura-Rivero, Marc Lanctot, Francesco Visin, Kate Larson
- **Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the standard for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, is known to fail to satisfy properties that are intuitively desirable, such as respecting the preferences of the majority \cite{ge2024axioms}. To overcome these issues, we propose the use of a probabilistic Social Choice rule called \emph{maximal lotteries} as a replacement for RLHF. We show that a family of alignment techniques, namely Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) \cite{munos2023nash} and variants, approximate maximal lottery outcomes and thus inherit its beneficial properties. We confirm experimentally that our proposed methodology handles situations that arise when working with preferences more robustly than standard RLHF, including supporting the preferences of the majority, providing principled ways of handling non-transitivities in the preference data, and robustness to irrelevant alternatives. This results in systems that better incorporate human values and respect human intentions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Jackpot! Alignment as a Maximal Lottery" presents a novel approach to aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values, proposing a shift from Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to a method based on maximal lotteries, a type of probabilistic Social Choice rule. The authors argue that RLHF often fails to uphold desirable alignment properties, particularly in reflecting majority preferences. The proposed method, which includes Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF) and its variants, is shown to approximate maximal lottery outcomes, thereby inheriting their beneficial characteristics. Empirical results demonstrate that this new methodology can better handle various complexities related to human preferences—such as non-transitivity and irrelevant alternatives—ultimately leading to results more aligned with human values and intentions. **Evaluation:** This paper demonstrates significant novelty and offers a fresh perspective on human-aligned LLM methods by integrating ideas from social choice theory into the field of reinforcement learning. The problem addressed—ineffectiveness of RLHF in encompassing a diverse range of human preferences—certainly resonates with ongoing concerns about ethical AI and aligns well with current research trends seeking to improve system robustness and decision-making quality. **Strengths:** 1. **Original Framework**: Introducing the concept of maximal lotteries as an alternative to RLHF is innovative and may pave the way for further explorations of probabilistic methods in reinforcement learning contexts. 2. **Robustness**: The experimental findings are compelling, indicating the new methodology's robustness compared to traditional approaches. This addresses a critical gap in maintaining alignment with actual human values. 3. **Clarity**: The paper presents a clearly articulated problem, rationale, and methodology, making it accessible to practitioners in both AI and social choice theory. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability**: While the paper discusses theoretical frameworks, it does not deeply explore the scalability of the maximal lottery approach in more complex real-world scenarios, where preference aggregation may become intricate. 2. **Comparative Studies**: Although comparisons with RLHF are made, a more rigorous comparative analysis against other emerging methods in human-in-the-loop systems could strengthen the argument for maximal lotteries. 3. **Implementation Challenges**: The practicality of applying maximal lotteries in dynamic, real-time LLM situations remains unclear, which may hinder immediate adoption despite theoretical advantages. Overall, while the work is insightful and contributes a significant new perspective to the alignment of AI systems, there are areas that require further exploration and validation. The paper's integration of social choice principles into RL invokes a broader conversation about interdisciplinary approaches in AI ethics and human alignment. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contributions to addressing a pressing problem in AI, along with its diligent introduction of novel methodologies; however, it is tempered by uncertainties regarding scalability and practical implementation challenges that warrant further investigation.

- **Abstract**: The advent of AI tools, such as Large Language Models, has introduced new possibilities for Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA), offering both opportunities and challenges. To help navigate the responsible integration of AI into QDA, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 HCI researchers experienced in QDA. While our participants were open to AI support in their QDA workflows, they expressed concerns about data privacy, autonomy, and the quality of AI outputs. In response, we developed a framework that spans from minimal to high AI involvement, providing tangible scenarios for integrating AI into HCI researchers' QDA practices while addressing their needs and concerns. Aligned with real-life QDA workflows, we identify potentials for AI tools in areas such as data pre-processing, researcher onboarding, or mediation. Our framework aims to provoke further discussion on the development of AI-supported QDA and to help establish community standards for their responsible use.

- **Authors**: Anirudh Chari, Aditya Tiwari, Richard Lian, Suraj Reddy, Brian Zhou
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities through chain-of-thought prompting, yet discovering effective reasoning methods for complex problems remains challenging due to the vast space of possible intermediate steps. We introduce Ant Colony Optimization-guided Tree of Thought (ACO-ToT), a novel algorithm that combines ACO with LLMs to discover optimal reasoning paths for complex problems efficiently. Drawing inspiration from Hebbian learning in neurological systems, our method employs a collection of distinctly fine-tuned LLM "ants" to traverse and lay pheromone trails through a centralized tree of thought, with each ant's movement governed by a weighted combination of existing pheromone trails and its own specialized expertise. The algorithm evaluates complete reasoning paths using a mixture-of-experts-based scoring function, with pheromones reinforcing productive reasoning paths across iterations. Experiments on three challenging reasoning tasks (GSM8K, ARC-Challenge, and MATH) demonstrate that ACO-ToT performs significantly better than existing chain-of-thought optimization approaches, suggesting that incorporating biologically inspired collective search mechanisms into LLM inference can substantially enhance reasoning capabilities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel algorithm called Ant Colony Optimization-guided Tree of Thought (ACO-ToT), designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by effectively navigating the complex space of potential reasoning paths. The algorithm employs a bio-inspired approach, utilizing multiple fine-tuned LLM "ants" that explore and lay pheromone trails within a centralized tree structure. This process helps reinforce successful reasoning paths through iterative scoring based on a mixture-of-experts scoring function. The authors conducted experiments on various challenging reasoning tasks, showing that ACO-ToT outperforms existing chain-of-thought optimization techniques, suggesting that biologically inspired search mechanisms can considerably elevate LLM reasoning performance. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper largely hinges on its integration of Ant Colony Optimization with LLMs, contrasting with typical chain-of-thought prompting methods. By introducing a biologically inspired, collective search mechanism, the authors present a fresh perspective on enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs, which has not been extensively explored in prior literature. This interdisciplinary approach—melding AI with insights from neurobiology—could spark significant advancements in both fields. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The ACO-ToT framework introduces a unique angle on reinforcement learning and optimization, potentially elevating problem-solving efficacy in LLMs. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The rigorous experimental evaluation across three challenging reasoning tasks provides strong evidence of the algorithm’s superiority over existing methods. 3. **Interdisciplinary Impact:** The paper bridges AI and neuroscience, encouraging further exploration into biologically inspired algorithms in machine learning. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Interpretability:** The use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs may complicate the interpretability of decision-making processes, making it difficult to analyze why certain reasoning paths are favored over others.  2. **Scalability Concerns:** While the experiments provide promising results, the scalability of the ACO-ToT method to larger or more diverse problem sets remains uncertain and warrants further investigation. 3. **Existing Approaches:** The paper does not fully explore or critique contemporary alternatives, which may limit the depth of its comparative effectiveness analysis. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper offers compelling insights and practical advancements in LLM reasoning paths, with the potential to reshape approaches to complex problem-solving in AI. However, concerns around interpretability and scalability suggest a need for cautious optimism.

### Low-Cost and Comprehensive Non-textual Input Fuzzing with LLM-Synthesized Input Generators
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19282v1)
- **Authors**: Kunpeng Zhang, Zongjie Li, Daoyuan Wu, Shuai Wang, Xin Xia
- **Abstract**: Modern software often accepts inputs with highly complex grammars. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown that they can be used to synthesize high-quality natural language text and code that conforms to the grammar of a given input format. Nevertheless, LLMs are often incapable or too costly to generate non-textual outputs, such as images, videos, and PDF files. This limitation hinders the application of LLMs in grammar-aware fuzzing. We present a novel approach to enabling grammar-aware fuzzing over non-textual inputs. We employ LLMs to synthesize and also mutate input generators, in the form of Python scripts, that generate data conforming to the grammar of a given input format. Then, non-textual data yielded by the input generators are further mutated by traditional fuzzers (AFL++) to explore the software input space effectively. Our approach, namely G2FUZZ, features a hybrid strategy that combines a holistic search driven by LLMs and a local search driven by industrial quality fuzzers. Two key advantages are: (1) LLMs are good at synthesizing and mutating input generators and enabling jumping out of local optima, thus achieving a synergistic effect when combined with mutation-based fuzzers; (2) LLMs are less frequently invoked unless really needed, thus significantly reducing the cost of LLM usage. We have evaluated G2FUZZ on a variety of input formats, including TIFF images, MP4 audios, and PDF files. The results show that G2FUZZ outperforms SOTA tools such as AFL++, Fuzztruction, and FormatFuzzer in terms of code coverage and bug finding across most programs tested on three platforms: UNIFUZZ, FuzzBench, and MAGMA.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a novel approach called G2FUZZ, which enhances grammar-aware fuzzing for non-textual inputs such as images, videos, and PDFs—areas where traditional large language models (LLMs) struggle. G2FUZZ involves synthesizing and mutating Python scripts, which act as input generators compliant with specific input formats, using LLMs. The generated non-textual data is then subjected to traditional mutation-based fuzzing, specifically employing AFL++. The hybrid strategy of G2FUZZ facilitates effective exploration of the software input space. Key benefits include the LLMs' capability to innovate input generators to escape local optima, and their strategic invocation which minimizes costs. The evaluation demonstrates that G2FUZZ surpasses leading tools like AFL++ and Fuzztruction in code coverage and bug detection across various platforms and inputs. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** G2FUZZ represents a significant advancement in the application of LLMs to non-textual inputs, an area that has been under-explored in the context of fuzzing. This innovation could potentially pave the way for broader usage of LLMs in software testing. 2. **Hybrid Strategy:** By combining LLM-generated input scripts with traditional fuzzing techniques, G2FUZZ effectively balances the exploration of input spaces, leading to enhanced coverage and bug-finding capabilities. This fusion of modern AI with established techniques reflects a promising new methodology. 3. **Performance Metrics:** The empirical results, which indicate superior performance in terms of code coverage and bug identification compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools, provide a strong validation of the approach and its practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Cost Justification:** While the paper claims significant cost reductions due to LLM usage, it would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the cost-benefit ratio compared to fully automated solutions that do not use LLMs. 2. **Robustness Across Formats:** It remains uncertain whether G2FUZZ can generalize to a broader range of non-textual formats beyond those tested, which may limit its applicability in certain real-world scenarios. 3. **Dependency on LLMs:** Relying on LLMs, despite their powerful capabilities, may cause performance fluctuations based on the underlying model used, thus raising concerns regarding consistency and reproducibility. **Potential Influence in the Field:** The paper's introduction of G2FUZZ could influence future research directions in fuzzing techniques, particularly regarding the integration of AI in testing frameworks. Furthermore, it opens avenues for developing more sophisticated input generation methods for various complex input types. **Score: 8/10** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, hinging on an innovative synthesis of LLMs in fuzzing that successfully addresses a notable gap. However, due to concerns over generality, robustness, and potential dependency on LLMs, it does not reach a perfect score. The strengths outweigh the weaknesses, and G2FUZZ has the potential for substantial impact, yet it requires further exploration and validation to solidify its place in the field.

### Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19297v1)
- **Authors**: Cory Hymel, Hiroe Johnson
- **Abstract**: The majority of research around Large Language Models (LLM) application to software development has been on the subject of code generation. There is little literature on LLMs' impact on requirements engineering (RE), which deals with the process of developing and verifying the system requirements. Within RE, there is a subdiscipline of requirements elicitation, which is the practice of discovering and documenting requirements for a system from users, customers, and other stakeholders. In this analysis, we compare LLM's ability to elicit requirements of a software system, as compared to that of a human expert in a time-boxed and prompt-boxed study. We found LLM-generated requirements were evaluated as more aligned (+1.12) than human-generated requirements with a trend of being more complete (+10.2%). Conversely, we found users tended to believe that solutions they perceived as more aligned had been generated by human experts. Furthermore, while LLM-generated documents scored higher and performed at 720x the speed, their cost was, on average, only 0.06% that of a human expert. Overall, these findings indicate that LLMs will play an increasingly important role in requirements engineering by improving requirements definitions, enabling more efficient resource allocation, and reducing overall project timelines.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Analysis of LLMs vs Human Experts in Requirements Engineering" investigates the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of requirements engineering (RE), specifically in the subdiscipline of requirements elicitation. Although much of the existing literature concentrates on code generation, this study aims to fill the gap regarding LLMs' influence on the process of defining and verifying system requirements. In a comparative analysis, it was found that LLM-generated requirements were perceived to be more aligned and, to some extent, more complete than those generated by human experts. Moreover, LLMs demonstrated an impressive efficiency, performing tasks 720 times faster and at a fraction of the cost of human professionals (0.06%). Despite these advantages, users favored human-generated solutions based on alignment perception. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly enhance requirements engineering practices by optimizing requirements documentation and project timelines while allowing for better resource management. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:**  The paper presents a timely exploration of LLMs in the less-explored domain of requirements engineering, a crucial activity in software development. The novelty stems from its focus on requirements elicitation rather than the more heavily studied area of code generation. By providing empirical data regarding LLM effectiveness compared to human experts, the study sheds light on a growing trend where AI tools are integrated into essential software development processes. **Strengths:** 1. **Empirical Evidence:** The study utilizes quantitative metrics to assess the alignment and completeness of LLM-generated requirements versus human expert outputs, providing robust data to support its conclusions. 2. **Cost and Efficiency Metrics:** The analysis of time and cost advantages of LLMs reveals the practical implications of adopting these models in professional settings, which is valuable for stakeholders in the software industry. 3. **Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant gap in literature, making it relevant for researchers and practitioners interested in maximizing the efficiency of software development workflows. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Subjectivity in Evaluation:** The reliance on user perceptions regarding alignment may introduce bias, as subjective interpretations can vary significantly among different stakeholders in real-world scenarios. 2. **Limited Scope:** While the study offers insights into requirements elicitation, it does not take into account the broader context of requirements engineering, such as validation or the complexities introduced by differing stakeholder perspectives. 3. **Long-Term Implications:** The paper could have explored the longitudinal effects of integrating LLMs into requirements engineering processes, particularly regarding the potential need for human oversight or ongoing validation of requirements elicited by AI. **Potential Influence:**  This study could influence future research by encouraging further investigations into LLM applications in different aspects of software engineering. It may also prompt software development firms to experiment with LLMs in their workflow, potentially leading to wider acceptance of AI tools in professional environments. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of software engineering by highlighting the advantages of LLMs in requirements elicitation while acknowledging the prevailing perceptions about human expertise. The strengths presented in its empirical approach outweigh its limitations, though further research is needed to understand operation nuances and long-term viability in real-world applications. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Zhiyao Xu, Dan Zhao, Qingsong Zou, Jingyu Xiao, Yong Jiang, Zhenhui Yuan, Qing Li
- **Abstract**: In recent years, as smart home systems have become more widespread, security concerns within these environments have become a growing threat. Currently, most smart home security solutions, such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction models, are trained using fixed datasets that are precollected. However, the process of dataset collection is time-consuming and lacks the flexibility needed to adapt to the constantly evolving smart home environment. Additionally, the collection of personal data raises significant privacy concerns for users. Lately, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks across diverse application domains, thanks to their strong capabilities in natural language processing, reasoning, and problem-solving. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based synthetic dataset generation IoTGen framework to enhance the generalization of downstream smart home intelligent models. By generating new synthetic datasets that reflect changes in the environment, smart home intelligent models can be retrained to overcome the limitations of fixed and outdated data, allowing them to better align with the dynamic nature of real-world home environments. Specifically, we first propose a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method tailored for IoT behavior data, which preserves the most informative content in the data while significantly reducing token consumption. Then, we propose a systematic approach to create prompts and implement data generation to automatically generate IoT synthetic data with normative and reasonable properties, assisting task models in adaptive training to improve generalization and real-world performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper proposes a novel framework, IoTGen, that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic datasets for smart home systems to improve security and adaptability. It identifies the limitations of traditional fixed datasets used in anomaly detection and behavior prediction, particularly their inflexibility and the privacy concerns associated with personal data collection. To address these issues, the authors introduce a Structure Pattern Perception Compression (SPPC) method designed to reduce token consumption while retaining vital information from IoT data. The framework systematically creates prompts to generate normative synthetic IoT data, enabling models to be retrained effectively and enhancing their generalization for real-world applications. **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty:** The paper addresses an important and timely issue in smart home security, bridging the gap between the limitations of existing datasets and the capabilities offered by LLMs. The introduction of a synthetic data generation method that adapts to the dynamic nature of smart homes is a meaningful advancement, especially given concerns surrounding real-time applicability and privacy constraints. However, the novelty of using LLMs for synthetic data generation is not entirely new, as similar approaches exist within the broader field of machine learning. 2. **Significance and Impact:** By presenting a structured method for generating IoT data, the paper potentially influences the design of smart home security systems. Successful implementation could lead to more robust and adaptive models that maintain security while respecting user privacy.

- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, conventional approaches such as repeated sampling with majority voting or reward model scoring, often face diminishing returns as test-time compute scales, in addition to requiring costly task-specific reward model training. In this paper, we present Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a novel method that leverages the self-verification and self-correction capabilities of recent advanced LLMs to overcome these limitations. SETS integrates sampling, self-verification, and self-correction into a unified framework, enabling efficient and scalable test-time computation for improved capabilities at complex tasks. Through extensive experiments on challenging planning and reasoning benchmarks, compared to the alternatives, we demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more favorable test-time scaling laws.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "SETS: Leveraging Self-Verification and Self-Correction for Improved Test-Time Scaling" introduces a method, Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), aimed at improving performance in complex reasoning tasks using Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional approaches, like majority voting and reward model scoring, struggle to maintain effectiveness as test-time computation scales, often requiring expensive training for task-specific reward models. SETS addresses these issues by integrating self-verification and self-correction with sampling within a unified framework. The authors conduct extensive experiments on planning and reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that SETS achieves significant performance enhancements and superior test-time scaling laws compared to existing methods. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty SETS presents a novel integration of self-verification and self-correction with traditional sampling methods, which is a fresh approach in the context of test-time scaling in LLMs. The literature on LLMs has indeed explored self-verification and self-correction, but the combination with an emphasis on efficient scaling during test-time computation appears to be original. The proposed solution potentially circumvents the significant drawbacks associated with existing methods that face diminishing returns as calculation scales. #### Significance The significance of SETS lies in its potential to make LLMs more effective and efficient in complex reasoning tasks, which are becoming increasingly important in various applications. By addressing the limitations of prior techniques, this research could pave the way for broader applications of LLMs in real-world settings. Enhanced performance and efficiency could lead to more widespread adoption and utilization in fields requiring advanced reasoning capabilities. #### Strengths - **Comprehensive Approach**: The unified framework of sampling, self-verification, and self-correction presents a cohesive approach to scaling. - **Performance Gains**: The paper provides empirical data supporting the effectiveness of SETS, demonstrating significant performance improvements. - **Addressing Current Limitations**: The work directly addresses the shortcomings of established methods in test-time computation scaling. #### Weaknesses - **Dependency on Advanced LLMs**: The reliance on the capabilities of advanced LLMs may limit the generalizability of the findings, as the method might not perform equally well with all LLMs. - **Complexity of Implementation**: Integrating multiple components could pose challenges in practical implementations, as the complexity may lead to increased computational overhead. - **Scope of Benchmarks**: While the paper boasts extensive experimentation, it would benefit from a broader range of benchmarks to validate its claims across different scenarios. ### Conclusion While SETS makes notable contributions, its reliance on certain assumptions about LLM performance and potential implementation complexities impact its broader applicability. Nevertheless, the methodology has the potential to advance efficiency in the application of LLMs in complex scenarios significantly. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid contribution to the field, acknowledging its strengths in novelty and empirical validation while balancing it against concerns regarding its applicability and complexity.
