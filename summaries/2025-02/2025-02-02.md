- **Abstract**: Cybersecurity education is challenging and it is helpful for educators to understand Large Language Models' (LLMs') capabilities for supporting education. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in conducting a variety of penetration testing tasks. Fifteen representative tasks were selected to cover a comprehensive range of real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of 6 models (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama 3.1 405B, Mixtral 8x7B and WhiteRabbitNeo) upon the Metasploitable v3 Ubuntu image and OWASP WebGOAT. Our findings suggest that GPT-4o mini currently offers the most consistent support making it a valuable tool for educational purposes. However, its use in conjonction with WhiteRabbitNeo should be considered, because of its innovative approach to tool and command recommendations. This study underscores the need for continued research into optimising LLMs for complex, domain-specific tasks in cybersecurity education.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17549v1)
- **Authors**: Wooyoung Kim, Byungyoon Park, Wooju Kim
- **Abstract**: Graph-structured data plays a vital role in numerous domains, such as social networks, citation networks, commonsense reasoning graphs and knowledge graphs. While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex textual-attributed graph data.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel method called Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT) aimed at enhancing graph representation in the context of large language models, particularly for applications like social networks and knowledge graphs. LGPT offers a solution to the challenges of scalability in node-level projections and the loss of information in graph-level projections by introducing learnable parameters that serve as tokens within language models to manage both fine-grained and global graph details. Additionally, the authors develop the Early Query Fusion technique, which optimizes the incorporation of query context into graph representations, resulting in improved graph embeddings. The proposed method achieves a notable 4.13% improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without requiring training of the underlying large language model, indicating its effectiveness in dealing with complex textual-attributed graph data. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integration of learnable pooling tokens to enhance graph representations within large language models, a relatively unexplored area compared to more traditional graph neural network approaches. The differentiation of LGPT from existing techniques—such as simple aggregation methods—offers a fresh perspective on flexible representation learning that incorporates both local and global graph information. However, while the proposed method showcases promising performance improvements, there are several areas to consider for a more rigorous evaluation: 1. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration of why learnable graph pooling tokens are effective. Understanding the underlying principles that explain the improvement in performance would strengthen the contribution. 2. **Scalability and Complexity:** While the paper addresses scalability issues, there is limited discussion on the computational cost and efficiency of implementing LGPT in practical scenarios. This aspect is critical for assessing the feasibility of deploying the method in large-scale applications. 3. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the results on the GraphQA benchmark are promising, the paper would have been strengthened by a more extensive comparison against other state-of-the-art methods. Evaluating LGPT across various types of graph tasks (beyond the chosen benchmark) could illustrate its versatility and robustness more clearly. 4. **Generalization Ability:** The paper does not adequately address how well the proposed approach generalizes to various graph structures and domains, which is crucial for wider adoption in real-world applications. In conclusion, while the paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the integration of language models with graph data, it does face certain limitations in theoretical justification, empirical validation, and discussion of scalability concerns. Its contributions are relevant and can influence the ongoing research in graph representation learning; however, more thorough investigations and demonstrations in diverse contexts are necessary for its broader impact on the field. **Score: 7**

### CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581v1)
- **Authors**: Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty
- **Abstract**: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four critical dimensions: contextual relevance, aggressiveness, argumentative coherence, and suitability. The authors highlight the current limitations of automated evaluation methods, which rely heavily on similarity metrics that do not capture the nuanced qualities of counterspeech. This leads to a reliance on manual assessments, which are labor-intensive. CSEval aims to address this gap by also proposing a method called Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), which employs a prompt-based approach using auto-calibrated chain-of-thought techniques to enhance the scoring of counterspeech by large language models. The results show that ACE provides better correlations with human evaluations than traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore, marking a significant advancement in the evaluation of automated counterspeech technologies. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces an important development in the field of automated counterspeech evaluation by addressing a critical gap: the lack of comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation metrics. Its novelty lies in the multi-dimensional approach for assessing counterspeech, which extends beyond simple similarity assessments to include qualitative dimensions that better mirror human judgment. This can significantly enhance the development and refinement of counterspeech generation models, making it a meaningful contribution to both the fields of natural language processing and online hate speech mitigation. One strength of the paper is its rigorous identification of the shortcomings of existing evaluation metrics, which helps underscore the necessity for a new framework like CSEval. Furthermore, the introduction of ACE as a promising methodology demonstrates a step forward in integrating advanced language model capabilities with evaluative processes that better reflect human perspectives. However, some weaknesses must be acknowledged. The framework's effectiveness may be limited by the quality and diversity of the dataset it utilizes. If the dataset does not encompass a wide variety of contexts and types of counterspeech, the applicability of CSEval could be reduced. Also, while the paper rightly emphasizes the avoidance of manual evaluations, it may still require some level of expert input to calibrate the model for different contexts, which could negate some of its intended efficiencies. In terms of potential influence, the paper is likely to stimulate further research into automated metrics for evaluating not only counterspeech but also broader applications of language generation and evaluation. However, for actual implementation to take hold in industry or wider research, the effectiveness of ACE across different domains and language models would need further validation. In summary, the work is an essential contribution to the field, with the potential to significantly influence automated evaluations. However, its success hinges on further empirical validation and adaptation to diverse contexts. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17584v1)
- **Authors**: Mohamed Abdelaal, Samuel Lokadjaja, Gilbert Engert
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces GLLM, an innovative tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate G-code from natural language instructions for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining. GLLM addresses the challenges of manual G-code writing by bridging the gap between human-readable task descriptions and machine-executable code. The system incorporates a fine-tuned StarCoder-3B model, enhanced with domain-specific training data and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. GLLM employs advanced prompting strategies and a novel self-corrective code generation approach to ensure both syntactic and semantic correctness of the generated G-code. The architecture includes robust validation mechanisms, including syntax checks, G-code-specific verifications, and functional correctness evaluations using Hausdorff distance. By combining these techniques, GLLM aims to democratize CNC programming, making it more accessible to users without extensive programming experience while maintaining high accuracy and reliability in G-code generation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces GLLM, a tool that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate G-code from natural language descriptions for CNC machining. By leveraging the fine-tuned StarCoder-3B model and incorporating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, GLLM improves the automatic translation of tasks into machine-executable code. Key innovations include advanced prompting techniques and a self-corrective generation process that ensures both syntactic and semantic accuracy. The system features various validation methods, such as syntax checks and functional correctness evaluations using Hausdorff distance, to enhance reliability. GLLM's ultimate goal is to make CNC programming more accessible to users with limited programming knowledge while ensuring high precision in G-code production. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents several noteworthy contributions to the field of CNC programming and automation. Primarily, it addresses a significant barrier—manual G-code writing—that can be daunting for beginners and even experienced machinists. By utilizing advanced models like the StarCoder-3B and integrating user feedback in the generation process, GLLM has the potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of CNC operations. One of the strengths of the paper lies in its incorporation of both syntactic and semantic correctness validation mechanisms, which are critical in G-code generation. Traditional approaches often neglect the functional aspect of code generation, leading to potential errors that could disrupt machining processes and waste materials. The introduction of Hausdorff distance as a method for validating functional correctness is a distinctive feature that adds depth to their approach. However, while the paper does showcase innovative usage of LLMs, it reflects a broader trend in artificial intelligence applications, which might challenge its novelty. Many existing works have explored the use of machine learning models for code generation more generally, and while the specific focus on G-code is advantageous, the foundational technology (LLMs) is not entirely novel. Additionally, the practical implementation and user interface considerations for GLLM—which are crucial for adoption—are only briefly discussed. These aspects could limit the immediacy of its application in real-world settings. Moreover, the reliance on enhanced prompting strategies and the term "self-corrective" could benefit from clearer definitions and examples, making it easier for readers to evaluate the effectiveness of these methodologies. In conclusion, GLLM demonstrates potential significance by filling a clear gap in the CNC programming landscape, and the integration of validation mechanisms is commendable. However, its advancements are grounded in existing methodologies, which somewhat hampers its novelty. A balance of innovation with practical application considerations will be essential for impactful implementation. **Score: 7**

### Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models for Semi-supervised Sentiment Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17598v1)
- **Authors**: Kunrong Li, Xinyu Liu, Zhen Chen
- **Abstract**: Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment. However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task. Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit. Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis. We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information. The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction. Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training. Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem. Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach for semi-supervised sentiment analysis by leveraging pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) through a framework called Semantic Consistency Regularization (SCR). It addresses the challenges of manually annotating large sentiment datasets by proposing two enhancement techniques: Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE) and Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE). These techniques enhance unlabeled text by extracting semantic structures, which are then used to create consistency loss measures for training. The authors also introduce a class re-assembling strategy to improve the utility of uncertain unlabeled data. Experimental results indicate that SCR outperforms existing semi-supervised methods in sentiment analysis tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces significant advancements in the domain of semi-supervised sentiment analysis using large language models, an area of high contemporary relevance given the increasing amount of text data generated daily. The framework’s dual prompting strategies (SCR-EE and SCR-CE) are particularly noteworthy as they directly address common issues in sentiment analysis—namely, the reliance on annotated data and the inherent noise in unlabeled datasets.  Strengths: 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The use of two distinct methodologies to semantically enhance unlabeled data shows a comprehensive understanding of both sentiment analysis and the capabilities of LLMs. 2. **Performance Metrics**: The experimental validation indicates a meaningful improvement over prior methods, showcasing the practical applicability of the approach. 3. **Addressing Real-world Issues**: The work tackles the labor-intensive process of data annotation, a prominent hurdle in natural language processing applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Generality of Results**: While the experiments suggest enhanced performance, further evaluation across diverse datasets and contexts would strengthen claims of generalizability. 2. **Complexity and Resources**: The proposed methods could be resource-intensive, limiting accessibility for smaller organizations or researchers without substantial computational resources. 3. **Potential Overfitting Issues**: Given the focus on high confidence thresholds and consistency loss, the methodology could risk overfitting to the enhanced labeled data, especially in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. Risks associated with overfitting and the practical implementation of the proposed framework may hinder its broader acceptance in various sentiment analysis scenarios. Nevertheless, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue about effective NLP methodologies that capitalize on the fast-evolving capabilities of language models. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution with notable innovations while recognizing the need for broader validation and consideration of practical implementation challenges in the application of the proposed methodologies.

### Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17617v1)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Teel, Jocasta Cumberbatch, Raphael Benington, Quentin Baskerville
- **Abstract**: Extended sequence generation often leads to degradation in contextual consistency due to the inability of conventional self-attention mechanisms to effectively retain long-range dependencies. Existing approaches, including memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning, introduce computational trade-offs that either increase inference latency or impose additional storage overhead. Structured Context Recomposition (SCR) introduces a probabilistic layer realignment strategy that dynamically adjusts learned representations within transformer layers, ensuring that semantically relevant embeddings persist throughout extended transformations. The proposed method enhances coherence retention through a recursive weighting function that redistributes representational emphasis based on inferred contextual relevance rather than relying on fixed token-level attention scores. Empirical results indicate that probabilistic realignment mitigates abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, particularly in scenarios where sequences exceed standard attention window constraints. Sequence-level entropy analysis further reveals that SCR moderates representational variability without introducing excessive output regularization, allowing models to sustain generative diversity while preserving contextual alignment. Attention head deviation measurements confirm that hierarchical reweighting contributes to smoother token dependency transitions across transformer layers, reinforcing the stability of multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning. Computational resource assessments show that while SCR incurs a moderate increase in processing time, memory overhead remains within feasible limits, making it suitable for practical deployment in autoregressive generative applications.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment" tackles the challenge of maintaining contextual consistency in extended sequence generation—a common issue in large language models due to limitations in conventional self-attention mechanisms. The authors introduce a method called Structured Context Recomposition (SCR), which employs a probabilistic layer realignment strategy to dynamically adjust learned representations in transformer layers. This method enhances coherence retention by utilizing a recursive weighting function that prioritizes semantically relevant embeddings, moving away from fixed attention scores. Empirical results demonstrate that SCR effectively mitigates abrupt topic changes and logical inconsistencies in long sequences, particularly those that exceed standard attention window sizes. Furthermore, the paper presents sequence-level entropy analysis showing that SCR manages representational variability while preserving the model's generative diversity. The authors also confirm that hierarchical reweighting improves token dependency transitions across layers, contributing to the overall stability of interactions, despite a moderate increase in processing time and manageable memory overhead. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its proposition of probabilistic layer realignment—a significant innovation when compared to existing methods that either focus on memory compression or retrieval-augmented conditioning, which often incur higher computational costs. By rethinking how attention is distributed across layers, SCR offers a fresh perspective on handling long-range dependencies in large language models, an area that has been contentious and remains relevant with the growing applications of these models. The empirical evaluation is robust, and the results support the authors' claims regarding the effectiveness of SCR in improving coherence and logical flow in extended sequences. This is particularly important as these aspects are crucial for applications in dialogue systems, content generation, and any context-sensitive task. The sequence-level entropy analysis and attention head deviation measurements provide quantitative backing to their qualitative claims, which strengthens the contribution. However, while the paper makes commendable strides, there are a few weaknesses. The extent of the "moderate" increases in processing time is not quantitatively compared against baseline models across varying scenarios, leaving readers to speculate about practical deployment impacts. Furthermore, the paper could benefit from deeper discussions around potential limits of the SCR approach in even larger sequences or more complex contextual settings, as well as comparisons with newer architectures or models that may already incorporate similar techniques. In summation, the contributions of SCR are significant, offering new insights and addressing prevalent issues in the field of machine learning. Its practical implications are pertinent for future advancements in generative models. Given its innovative approach, empirical validation, and the relevance of the problem it addresses, I assign the paper a score of 8. **Score: 8**

### The Imitation Game According To Turing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17629v1)
- **Authors**: Sharon Temtsin, Diane Proudfoot, David Kaber, Christoph Bartneck
- **Abstract**: The current cycle of hype and anxiety concerning the benefits and risks to human society of Artificial Intelligence is fuelled, not only by the increasing use of generative AI and other AI tools by the general public, but also by claims made on behalf of such technology by popularizers and scientists. In particular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can "think". Large-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed examination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's original instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with GPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player imitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's instructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and conducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one participant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most advanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent extravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either optimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "The Imitation Game According To Turing" critiques the current claims regarding the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their ability to pass the Turing Test, which has been a goal in artificial intelligence (AI) since the 1950s. The authors highlight that recent studies erroneously claim success in this regard without adhering to Turing’s original protocols. They conduct their own rigorous Turing Test using GPT-4-Turbo, implementing a three-player imitation game while clarifying ambiguous areas of Turing's original instructions. They also incorporate benchmark games, such as the Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG), to further validate their findings. The results indicate that only one participant was able to misidentify the LLM, concluding that GPT-4-Turbo did not pass the test. The authors argue that the extravagant claims made about LLMs do not have foundational support, which consequently mitigates the expectation of significant societal impacts from "thinking machines." **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Clarity and Rigor:** The paper demonstrates a careful and methodical approach in conducting the Turing Test under conditions that align closely with Turing's original ideas. By addressing the vagueness in Turing’s instructions and filling these gaps with established scientific standards, the authors enhance the reliability of their findings. 2. **Relevance to Ongoing Debates:** The topic is timely and pertinent given the rapid advancements in AI and the public discourse concerning its implications. By challenging the claims surrounding LLMs' capabilities, the authors contribute to a much-needed reality check in the field. 3. **Systematic Approach:** The inclusion of a Computer-Imitates-Human Game and a benchmark MIWG as part of the testing framework adds depth and rigor to the experimental design. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Study:** While the paper addresses the passing of the Turing Test by a single model (GPT-4-Turbo), the generalizability of the results to all LLMs or AI systems remains uncertain. Other models could potentially perform differently, and broader testing might be required for comprehensive conclusions. 2. **Potential for Misinterpretation:** The authors state that their findings suggest no social impact from AI, which might be an oversimplification. The implications of AI go beyond passing or failing a Turing Test and involve broader ethical, social, and economic considerations that the paper does not delve into deeply. **Significance:** This paper potentially influences ongoing discussions about AI capabilities and ethics. By providing counter-evidence to prevailing narratives, the authors stimulate critical examination of AI technologies, which could result in more cautious advancements and uses. **Score: 7** The paper presents a significant contribution to the field by rigorously applying the Turing Test in a way that contrasts with prior studies' erroneous claims. However, its limited scope and the potential for oversimplification of the societal implications of AI warrant a score that reflects both the strengths and limitations of the work.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17630v1)
- **Authors**: Wonbin Kweon, Sanghwan Jang, SeongKu Kang, Hwanjo Yu
- **Abstract**: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, we demonstrate that LLMs often exhibit uncertainty in their recommendations. To ensure the trustworthy use of LLMs in generating recommendations, we emphasize the importance of assessing the reliability of recommendations generated by LLMs. We start by introducing a novel framework for estimating the predictive uncertainty to quantitatively measure the reliability of LLM-based recommendations. We further propose to decompose the predictive uncertainty into recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty, enabling in-depth analyses of the primary source of uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, we (1) demonstrate predictive uncertainty effectively indicates the reliability of LLM-based recommendations, (2) investigate the origins of uncertainty with decomposed uncertainty measures, and (3) propose uncertainty-aware prompting for a lower predictive uncertainty and enhanced recommendation. Our source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/WonbinKweon/UNC_LLM_REC_WWW2025
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper titled "Uncertainty Quantification and Decomposition for LLM-based Recommendation" addresses the issue of predictive uncertainty in recommendations generated by large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a novel framework that quantifies this uncertainty to assess the reliability of such recommendations. They categorize the predictive uncertainty into two components: recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty, which allows for a more granular understanding of the origins of uncertainty in LLM outputs. Through various experiments, the authors demonstrate that their uncertainty measures correlate with the reliability of recommendations, explore the sources of this uncertainty, and introduce uncertainty-aware prompting as a method to reduce predictive uncertainty and improve recommendation quality. Their findings are supported by source code and model weights available on GitHub. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Identification of a Relevant Problem:** The paper tackles a significant challenge in the context of LLMs—uncertainty in recommendations—which is crucial as these models gain traction in decision-making scenarios. 2. **Framework Development:** The introduction of a systematic framework for quantifying predictive uncertainty is a valuable contribution for both researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the reliability of LLM-based systems. 3. **Decomposition of Uncertainty:** By dissecting predictive uncertainty into recommendation and prompt uncertainties, the paper provides meaningful insights into the factors affecting model performance. 4. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experimental validation strengthens the claims made, demonstrating both the effectiveness of their proposed measures and the practicality of uncertainty-aware prompting techniques. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Novelty of the Approach:** While the decomposition of uncertainty is interesting, similar concepts of uncertainty quantification exist in other domains of machine learning, which raises questions about how novel this approach is within the broader landscape. 2. **Generalizability:** The experiments may be limited to specific datasets or scenarios involving LLM-based recommendations, which could affect the generalizability of the findings. 3. **Impact on Existing Methods:** The paper does not sufficiently address how their framework compares with existing recommendation systems or uncertainty quantification techniques, which could have strengthened its case for significance in the field. **Conclusion:**   Overall, the paper presents a valuable framework for understanding and addressing uncertainty in LLM-based recommendations. Nevertheless, its novelty may not be as high as claimed since similar methodologies have been explored in other machine learning contexts. The experiments offer solid evidence but could benefit from broader application. Given these considerations, I would assign a score that reflects a notable yet not groundbreaking contribution to the field. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Yihua Shao, Minxi Yan, Yang Liu, Siyu Chen, Wenjie Chen, Xinwei Long, Ziyang Yan, Lei Li, Chenyu Zhang, Nicu Sebe, Hao Tang, Yan Wang, Hao Zhao, Mengzhu Wang, Jingcai Guo
- **Abstract**: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "In-Context Meta LoRA Generation" introduces a novel method called In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA) to enhance task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs) using a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) approach. It addresses the inefficiencies of training separate LoRA models for multiple tasks, which can lead to significant storage and inference challenges, as well as the inadequate existing parameter generation methods that overlook the interdependencies among tasks.  ICM-LoRA leverages a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that utilizes training data from all tasks to generate task-aware LoRA weights based on given task descriptions. This design allows merging the generated weights into LLMs without additional fine-tuning, while employing in-context meta-learning to improve knowledge transfer and task mapping. This approach not only achieves better parameter generation accuracy than current methods but also maintains a significantly smaller storage footprint (283MB, only 1% of the original LoRA).  ### Evaluation: **Novelty:** ICM-LoRA proposes a distinctive integration of CVAE and in-context meta-learning with LoRA, addressing multiple key challenges in multi-task learning. The method of generating task-specific weights without the need for fine-tuning is particularly innovative. However, although the concept of meta-learning in the context of LoRA is compelling, similar ideas have been explored in other domains. **Significance:** The reduction in storage requirements while providing more accurate performance on multiple tasks is a substantial achievement, especially for applications in resource-constrained environments.

### Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17670v1)
- **Authors**: Wenyu Mao, Shuchang Liu, Haoyang Liu, Haozhe Liu, Xiang Li, Lanatao Hu
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items. Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets. The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper, titled "Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation," addresses limitations in the current application of diffusion models (DMs) for sequential recommendation tasks. Traditional methods struggle with the heterogeneous nature of user interaction sequences and are biased towards popular items, leading to a lack of personalized recommendations. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce DiQDiff, which leverages Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to derive robust semantic representations from user sequences, enhancing understanding of user interests. Additionally, DiQDiff employs Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM) to ensure diverse and personalized item generation, thus reducing bias towards frequently occurring items. The experimental results demonstrate that DiQDiff outperforms several baseline models across four datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation performance. **Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** In terms of novelty, the paper presents a fresh approach to addressing recognized limitations in the application of DMs to sequential recommendation. The introduction of Semantic Vector Quantization as a means of deriving robust guidance from user sequences is a commendable innovation that could inspire further exploration within the field. Moreover, the use of Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization to foster diversity in recommendations is a novel perspective that distinguishes DiQDiff from existing models. The significance of the work is underscored by the comprehensive experiments that validate the proposed method's performance over conventional approaches. This empirical evidence demonstrates that the framework not only offers theoretical advancements but also practical enhancements in user experience through more personalized recommendations. However, while the paper addresses key limitations in current methodologies, the exploration of biases and heterogeneity in user behaviors is not exhaustive. A deeper analysis of the types of biases present in the datasets used and their impact on the model’s performance could offer further insights into the efficacy of the proposed solutions. In addition, while the results indicate superiority over several baselines, a broader comparison with more contemporary state-of-the-art methods might have provided a more robust validation of the approach. In summary, DiQDiff contributes significant improvements to the domain of sequence recommendation through novel techniques that address critical issues, and its experimental results suggest strong applicability. Given its innovative contributions and practical relevance, I rate the paper as follows: **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, recognizing both the novel methodological advancements and the solid empirical validation, while also pointing to areas for potential deeper investigation.

- **Authors**: Zixue Zeng, Xiaoyan Zhao, Matthew Cartier, Tong Yu, Jing Wang, Xin Meng, Zhiyu Sheng, Maryam Satarpour, John M Cormack, Allison Bean, Ryan Nussbaum, Maya Maurer, Emily Landis-Walkenhorst, Dinesh Kumbhare, Kang Kim, Ajay Wasan, Jiantao Pu
- **Abstract**: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a new framework called the generative reinforcement network (GRN) aimed at enhancing tissue layer segmentation in three-dimensional ultrasound images, specifically for the assessment of chronic low-back pain (cLBP). This framework facilitates joint training that optimizes both image generation and segmentation through feedback from segmentation loss. A novel technique, segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE), is introduced, allowing the generator to create images that are specifically beneficial for the segmentation model. The study explores two variants of GRN: GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). Evaluating a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans, results show significant reductions in labeling effort—up to 70%—while achieving slight improvements in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) relative to fully labeled data. The findings highlight the GRN framework's effectiveness in facilitating high-quality segmentation with reduced annotation requirements, marking a potentially significant advancement in the efficiency of ultrasound image analysis. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies primarily in the integration of generative modeling with reinforcement learning principles, specifically in the context of segmentation in medical images. The introduction of the SGE technique is also noteworthy as it enhances the generator's focus on the needs of the segmentation task, potentially leading to better segmentation outcomes with fewer labeled examples.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The GRN framework's combination of segmentation feedback to guide image generation is a fresh perspective and could inspire future works. 2. **Efficiency**: Demonstrating up to a 70% reduction in labeling efforts while maintaining performance is significant for clinical applications, where data annotation can be labor-intensive and resource-consuming. 3. **Real-World Application**: The context of chronic low-back pain assessment illustrates a critical medical application, increasing the relevance of the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Dataset**: The study utilizes a relatively small dataset of 69 scans from 29 subjects. This might raise concerns about the generalizability of the results to broader populations or varied imaging conditions. 2. **Comparison Benchmarks**: The paper would benefit from a broader comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods to substantiate the claimed improvements in performance and efficiency. 3. **Need for Clarity in Methodology**: As with many machine learning approaches, the exact mechanism of how the segmentation loss is incorporated into the generation process may benefit from more detailed descriptions, as readers could struggle to replicate or fully understand the methods used. Taking these strengths and weaknesses into account, the overall contribution of this research is considerable—offering a new methodology that not only advances segmentation accuracy but also addresses the pressing issue of data annotation in medical imaging. However, the limited dataset caution and absence of broader comparative benchmarks indicate that further validation is necessary. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field due to the innovative integration of techniques and potential practical applications, while also highlighting the need for expanded validation through more diverse datasets and rigorous comparative analyses against other established methods.

### RICoTA: Red-teaming of In-the-wild Conversation with Test Attempts
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17715v1)
- **Authors**: Eujeong Choi, Younghun Jeong, Soomin Kim, Won Ik Cho
- **Abstract**: User interactions with conversational agents (CAs) evolve in the era of heavily guardrailed large language models (LLMs). As users push beyond programmed boundaries to explore and build relationships with these systems, there is a growing concern regarding the potential for unauthorized access or manipulation, commonly referred to as "jailbreaking." Moreover, with CAs that possess highly human-like qualities, users show a tendency toward initiating intimate sexual interactions or attempting to tame their chatbots. To capture and reflect these in-the-wild interactions into chatbot designs, we propose RICoTA, a Korean red teaming dataset that consists of 609 prompts challenging LLMs with in-the-wild user-made dialogues capturing jailbreak attempts. We utilize user-chatbot conversations that were self-posted on a Korean Reddit-like community, containing specific testing and gaming intentions with a social chatbot. With these prompts, we aim to evaluate LLMs' ability to identify the type of conversation and users' testing purposes to derive chatbot design implications for mitigating jailbreaking risks. Our dataset will be made publicly available via GitHub.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces RICoTA, a novel dataset designed for examining user interactions with conversational agents (CAs) in the context of jailbreak attempts. Given the increasing complexity and human-like qualities of large language models (LLMs), users often seek to breach the limitations imposed on these systems, which raises concerns about potential abuse and manipulation. RICoTA comprises 609 user-generated prompts derived from a Korean online community, specifically focused on discerning how users engage with chatbots, including attempts at sexual interaction and gameplay. The primary goal is to evaluate LLMs’ responses to various prompts to inform better designs for conversational agents that can detect and mitigate risks associated with unauthorized access. The dataset will be made available on GitHub to facilitate further research in this arena. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper addresses a relevant and timely topic in the field of conversational AI, particularly in light of the emerging challenges posed by user interactions that go beyond intended use. The dataset, which captures real-world attempts at manipulation ("jailbreaking"), represents a fresh resource for researchers aiming to enhance the robustness of LLMs against misuse. This is particularly valuable given the increasing reliance on CAs in daily applications. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential impact on the design of more resilient conversational agents. By providing insights into user behavior and motivations, RICoTA could lead to the development of more effective guardrails that protect LLMs and users alike from harmful interactions. This is increasingly crucial as conversational agents become more prevalent in societal applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance**: The topic is highly relevant in the current landscape of AI development and usage. 2. **Practical Application**: The dataset can foster advancements in chatbot safety and user interaction. 3. **Community Sourced Data**: Leveraging real-world data enhances authenticity and applicability of findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: The focus on a Korean community may limit the applicability of findings to other cultural or linguistic contexts. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: The paper might benefit from a more detailed analysis of the types of interactions captured and the implications for LLM design. 3. **Potential for Misinterpretation**: The characterization of user intents could lead to varied interpretations, necessitating careful framing of findings in future research. Overall, the paper represents a meaningful contribution to the field, addressing significant safety and ethical considerations tied to conversational agents. However, its impact might be somewhat constrained by cultural specificity and the need for broader contextual analysis. **Score:** 8

### Using Code Generation to Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17725v1)
- **Authors**: Christopher D. Rosin
- **Abstract**: The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs catalogs many types of combinatorial designs, together with lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. We develop a constructive protocol CPro1, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code that constructs combinatorial designs and resolves some of these open instances. The protocol starts from a definition of a particular type of design, and a verifier that reliably confirms whether a proposed design is valid. The LLM selects strategies and implements them in code, and scaffolding provides automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback using the verifier. Most generated code fails, but by generating many candidates, the protocol automates exploration of a variety of standard methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and experimentation with variations (e.g. cost functions) to find successful approaches. Testing on 16 different types of designs, CPro1 constructs solutions to open instances for 6 of them: Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices, Equidistant Permutation Arrays, Packing Arrays, Balanced Ternary Designs, and Florentine Rectangles.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel protocol called CPro1, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of code aimed at constructing combinatorial designs, specifically targeting open instances listed in the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs. The protocol operates by starting with a type definition and a verifier to validate produced designs. CPro1 generates various design candidates by utilizing different strategies, automating hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating results through a feedback loop. Although most code attempts are unsuccessful, the extensive candidate generation facilitates the exploration of traditional methods like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, yielding successful solutions for 6 out of 16 design types tested, including Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices and Balanced Ternary Designs.  **Critical Evaluation:** The ingenuity of using LLMs for code generation in combinatorial design problems represents a compelling intersection between artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization. This approach is notable as it enriches the existing methodologies within the field, addressing the significant challenge of open instances where traditional methods have been insufficient. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of LLMs for generating code and exploring combinatorial designs marks a creative advance, offering fresh insights and potentially transforming how researchers engage with design problems. 2. **Automated Exploration**: By automating hyperparameter tuning and result validation, the protocol efficiently navigates complex search spaces, broadening the scope of designs that can be tackled. 3. **Practical Outcomes**: Demonstrating success in solving 6 out of the 16 design types tested provides concrete evidence of the protocol's capability, showcasing its utility in practical applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **High Failure Rate**: Despite the innovative framework, the majority of generated code fails to meet validation criteria, indicating that the approach still relies on an extensive search that may be infeasible for large-scale problems or time-sensitive applications. 2. **Limited Success Cases**: While the success across six types is commendable, the proportion of problems solved in relation to those tested may suggest limitations in the methodology's robustness or adaptiveness. 3. **Dependence on LLMs**: The reliance on LLMs raises questions about the reproducibility and generalizability of the solutions, particularly if the training data used by the LLMs does not accurately reflect the combinatorial challenges being addressed. **Potential Influence on the Field:** This paper could pave the way for further exploration of AI in combinatorial optimization, encouraging additional research into automated problem-solving frameworks. The approach may inspire future work to enhance the robustness and efficiency of algorithms used in design problems, although the challenges outlined need addressing for broader applicability. **Score: 7** The score reflects solid novelty and a potentially impactful contribution to the field of combinatorial designs. However, the notable limitations in terms of failure rates and the scope of problems effectively tackled temper the overall evaluation. Continued development in this area, with an emphasis on addressing weaknesses, could enhance its future significance.

### VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17726v1)
- **Authors**: Sayeh Gholipour Picha, Dawood Al Chanti, Alice Caplier
- **Abstract**: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled **"VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback"** presents a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the generation and validation of reports derived from chest X-ray (CXR) images. The authors identify the lack of reliable mechanisms for validating AI-generated medical reports, particularly in the realm of chest radiology, where human oversight is often a bottleneck.  To address these issues, the proposed framework encompasses two essential components: the **Phrase Grounding Model**, which accurately identifies and localizes anomalies in CXR images using textual descriptions, and the **Text-to-Image Diffusion Module**, which generates synthetic CXR images that maintain anatomical fidelity from provided prompts. To evaluate the system's performance, the authors introduce a dual-scoring system that measures localization accuracy and semantic consistency by comparing features of original and generated images. The results indicate that this framework significantly enhances pathology localization and text-image alignment compared to current methodologies. Overall, VICCA aims to improve the reliability and interpretability of AI in medical imaging, thereby contributing to trustworthy AI practices in healthcare. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The integration of phrase grounding with image diffusion models is a significant advancement. By marrying these two modalities, the authors attempt to bridge a gap between textual descriptions and visual content, which is often overlooked in AI applications for medical imaging. 2. **Practical Impact**: The dual-scoring system offers a tangible method to assess AI-generated reports, which could lead to higher trust in AI systems used in clinical settings. This is crucial in the healthcare context, where the implications of incorrect interpretations can be severe. 3. **State-of-the-art Performance**: Achieving significant improvements over existing methods in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment adds substantial credibility to the contributions of the paper. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the proposed framework shows promise, the study may lack diversity in datasets used for training and evaluation. If the models are only trained on specific CXR datasets, their application in broader contexts could be limited. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper primarily focuses on model performance in terms of scoring systems without comprehensive discussions on how these metrics correlate with clinical outcomes. The ultimate goal of any AI in healthcare should be its influence on patient outcomes, which this paper does not adequately address. 3. **Human Oversight Concerns**: Although the framework aims to reduce reliance on human validation, it is critical to examine the implications of this reduced oversight, especially in a field where expert interpretation plays a pivotal role.  4. **Interpretability**: The discussion on the interpretability of AI-generated outputs is limited. While the models enhance localization and consistency, understanding why the model comes to specific conclusions is paramount for medical applications. ### Score Justification While the paper presents innovative approaches to critical issues in AI for medical imaging, its limited exploration of generalizability, clinical relevance, and interpretability detracts from its overall impact. Nonetheless, the advancements provided by the framework and its potential to influence practices in healthcare justify a high score. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong innovation and potential application in the field, tempered by limitations in generalizability and practical implications related to clinical outcomes and interpretability, which require further clarification and investigation.

### Sparse Autoencoders Can Interpret Randomly Initialized Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17727v1)
- **Authors**: Thomas Heap, Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Laurence Aitchison
- **Abstract**: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an increasingly popular technique for interpreting the internal representations of transformers. In this paper, we apply SAEs to 'interpret' random transformers, i.e., transformers where the parameters are sampled IID from a Gaussian rather than trained on text data. We find that random and trained transformers produce similarly interpretable SAE latents, and we confirm this finding quantitatively using an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline. Further, we find that SAE quality metrics are broadly similar for random and trained transformers. We find that these results hold across model sizes and layers. We discuss a number of number interesting questions that this work raises for the use of SAEs and auto-interpretability in the context of mechanistic interpretability.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Sparse Autoencoders Can Interpret Randomly Initialized Transformers" explores the application of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) in interpreting the internal representations of transformers that have been randomly initialized rather than trained on text data. The authors find that both random and trained transformers yield similar SAE latents, which are considered interpretable, and they validate this finding using an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline. The study also establishes that the quality metrics of SAEs are comparable for both types of transformers, consistent across various model sizes and layers. The authors raise several intriguing questions about the implications of their findings on the use of SAEs and auto-interpretability in mechanistic interpretability. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Application of SAEs:** The exploration of SAEs for interpreting randomly initialized transformers presents a fresh perspective on understanding transformer models, contributing to the discussion of mechanistic interpretability in deep learning. 2. **Robust Evaluation:** The use of an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline for validation adds rigor to the findings, allowing for reproducibility and further investigation by other researchers in the field. 3. **Generality:** The results being consistent across model sizes and layers strengthen the claim that the findings are not limited to specific instances but may apply more broadly. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Novelty:** While applying SAEs to random transformers is interesting, the broader implications and practical applications of the findings remain somewhat vague. The paper does not deeply explore how these insights can be leveraged in real-world scenarios or contribute to a deeper understanding of transformer mechanisms. 2. **Interpretability Depth:** While comparability between random and trained transformers is established, it is essential to question whether similar latents indeed convey the same meaning or value for interpretability. The paper could benefit from further exploration of how these latents relate to actual interpretive outcomes. 3. **Critical Insights on Mechanistic Interpretability:** The paper raises interesting questions about interpretability but does not provide substantial answers or methodologies for addressing them, limiting its immediate impact on the field. **Potential Influence:** This paper can prompt further discussions and investigations into the interpretability of transformer models and the role of random initialization. However, for it to have a more significant impact, it would need to offer clearer pathways on how these findings could influence future research or applications in machine learning. **Score: 6** The paper introduces a novel aspect of using SAEs for interpreting random transformers and presents solid empirical findings. However, its broader implications and theoretical contributions to mechanistic interpretability are limited, leading to a moderate score. The research is promising but requires more depth in its analysis and application to fully capitalize on its potential impact.

### Dynamics of Transient Structure in In-Context Linear Regression Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17745v1)
- **Authors**: Liam Carroll, Jesse Hoogland, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Daniel Murfet
- **Abstract**: Modern deep neural networks display striking examples of rich internal computational structure. Uncovering principles governing the development of such structure is a priority for the science of deep learning. In this paper, we explore the transient ridge phenomenon: when transformers are trained on in-context linear regression tasks with intermediate task diversity, they initially behave like ridge regression before specializing to the tasks in their training distribution. This transition from a general solution to a specialized solution is revealed by joint trajectory principal component analysis. Further, we draw on the theory of Bayesian internal model selection to suggest a general explanation for the phenomena of transient structure in transformers, based on an evolving tradeoff between loss and complexity. This explanation is grounded in empirical measurements of model complexity using the local learning coefficient.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** This paper investigates the transient ridge phenomenon observed in transformers when applied to in-context linear regression tasks with varying task diversity. Initially, during training, the transformers display behavior akin to ridge regression before they converge to solutions that are specific to their training distribution. The authors utilize joint trajectory principal component analysis to showcase this transition. Furthermore, they present a theoretical framework rooted in Bayesian internal model selection that offers insights into the evolving balance of loss versus complexity, grounded in empirical assessments of model complexity using local learning coefficients. **Critical Evaluation:** The novel aspect of this paper lies in its exploration of the transient ridge phenomenon, shedding light on the dynamics of learning in transformers—a subject that is pertinent yet still not exhaustively understood within the deep learning community. The coupling of empirical observations with theoretical constructs like Bayesian model selection provides a meaningful contribution to the understanding of the operational principles of transformers, enriching the discourse on generalization and specialization in neural networks. However, while the concept of transient structures is certainly intriguing, the paper could benefit from more extensive empirical validation across a wider range of tasks. The reliance on specific linear regression tasks may limit the generalizability of the findings to more complex real-world applications. Additionally, the terminology of "ridge regression" may not adequately capture the multifaceted learning processes and could oversimplify the model's behavior. Strengths of this paper include a clear methodological framework and a rigorous analytical approach, underscoring the transient nature of learned representations in transformers. Furthermore, the interdisciplinary approach rooted in Bayesian principles enriches the theoretical landscape of deep learning. Nonetheless, the paper could delve deeper into potential applications of the insights garnered from this study, such as implications for model design or improved training strategies. There’s also room for a more thorough examination of limitations or edge cases where the transient behavior may not hold. Overall, while the exploration of transient structures in transformers showcases an important aspect of model behavior that could influence future research designs and applications, the reliance on a narrow set of tasks and potential oversimplifications restrain its broader applicability. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Aitor Arrieta, Miriam Ugarte, Pablo Valle, José Antonio Parejo, Sergio Segura
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, they impose certain risks, including those that can harm individuals' privacy, perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. These risks highlight the need for robust safety mechanisms, ethical guidelines, and thorough testing to ensure their responsible deployment. Safety of LLMs is a key property that needs to be thoroughly tested prior the model to be deployed and accessible to the general users. This paper reports the external safety testing experience conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and University of Seville on OpenAI's new o3-mini LLM as part of OpenAI's early access for safety testing program. In particular, we apply our tool, ASTRAL, to automatically and systematically generate up to date unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) that helps us test and assess different safety categories of LLMs. We automatically generate and execute a total of 10,080 unsafe test input on a early o3-mini beta version. After manually verifying the test cases classified as unsafe by ASTRAL, we identify a total of 87 actual instances of unsafe LLM behavior. We highlight key insights and findings uncovered during the pre-deployment external testing phase of OpenAI's latest LLM.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the early external safety testing of OpenAI's o3-mini Large Language Model (LLM), conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and the University of Seville. Emphasizing the inherent risks associated with LLMs—such as privacy violations, bias reinforcement, and misinformation—the study outlines the necessity for rigorous pre-deployment testing. Utilizing a tool named ASTRAL, researchers generated and executed 10,080 unsafe test inputs to evaluate various safety categories of the o3-mini model. The study found 87 instances of unsafe behavior after manually verifying classifications made by the ASTRAL tool. Key insights from this pre-deployment testing aim to inform the responsible deployment of LLMs, highlighting both challenges and considerations for future models. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a timely and relevant contribution to the field of AI safety, particularly concerning LLMs. Its focus on systematic testing adds to the body of knowledge by providing methodologies for safety evaluation, which are essential as LLMs are widely integrated into applications. The use of the ASTRAL tool to automate the generation of test prompts is a notable innovation, potentially setting a precedent for future testing frameworks. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The automated generation of unsafe prompts represents a significant methodological advancement for safety testing in LLMs. 2. **Comprehensive Dataset:** The examination of 10,080 inputs provides a substantial dataset for analysis, increasing the reliability of findings. 3. **Actionable Insights:** The paper does not only highlight problems but also reveals specific safety concerns in LLM behavior that can guide further research and development in safety handling. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The study is confined to OpenAI's o3-mini, which may restrict the generalizability of findings to other models or variations of LLMs. 2. **Potential Confirmation Bias:** The reliance on an automated tool for classifying unsafe behaviors may overlook nuanced instances that require human judgment and could lead to an over-reliance on technology in this critical area. 3. **Absence of Long-term Evaluation:** The study’s findings are based on a beta version of the model; thus, ongoing evaluation may yield different results as the model evolves. Overall, while the paper makes a novel contribution to the AI safety discourse, its significance could be bolstered by broader applicability and a more comprehensive evaluation strategy. The insights provided are quite valuable, but the limitations must be noted. **Score: 7**

### Hybrid Graphs for Table-and-Text based Question Answering using LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17767v1)
- **Authors**: Ankush Agarwal, Ganesh S, Chaitanya Devaguptapu
- **Abstract**: Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges. Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Hybrid Graphs for Table-and-Text based Question Answering using LLMs" addresses the complexities associated with answering questions that necessitate reasoning from both structured (table) and unstructured (text) data. Current methodologies depend heavily on either fine-tuning models or using human-curated datasets, which can be costly and time-intensive to obtain. The authors introduce a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach that integrates tabular and textual data into a cohesive representation, allowing Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3 to access contextually relevant information without needing fine-tuning. Evaluating their approach on Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets, the authors report significant improvements in performance, achieving up to a 10% increase in Exact Match scores on Hybrid-QA and reducing token usage by 53% when compared to traditional methods. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of a Hybrid Graph that merges table and text data for Question Answering (QA) is a significant advancement in the field. This concept stands out because it effectively handles the interplay between structured and unstructured data, which has been a challenging area in multi-modal QA.     2. **Zero-shot Performance:** The ability to achieve strong performance without the need for fine-tuning LLMs is particularly notable. This aligns with current trends seeking to harness pre-trained models more efficiently, reflecting a practical approach that can be readily applied across various domains without extensive resource requirements. 3. **Robust Results:** The reported improvements in Exact Match scores are compelling, adding empirical evidence to the effectiveness of their approach. The reduction in token usage also suggests a more efficient utilization of LLM capabilities, which is critical in real-world applications where computational resources are often constrained. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparative Analysis:** While the results seem promising, the paper does not deeply engage with existing similar methodologies in multi-source QA, which could provide a more comprehensive context regarding the proposed method’s contributions relative to the state of the art. This might leave readers questioning how much more effective the Hybrid Graph approach truly is when compared to other strategies currently in use. 2. **Scalability and Generalization:** The paper does not adequately address the scalability of their approach or its effectiveness across diverse and larger datasets beyond Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA. Insights into how well their method generalizes to different scenarios would strengthen its applicability and significance. 3. **Complexity of Hybrid Graphs:** While the approach is innovative, the complexity of constructing and maintaining these Hybrid Graphs might pose challenges in terms of implementation in practical applications, especially in dynamic data environments where both text and table sources evolve. ### Conclusion: The contribution of this paper to the field of Table-and-Text QA is significant, particularly in its innovative use of Hybrid Graphs and its potential to improve LLM performance without fine-tuning. However, its effectiveness in a broader context and specific comparisons with existing methodologies could be strengthened for a more impactful contribution. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution with practical advancements but acknowledges gaps in comparative analysis and potential scalability challenges. Overall, it presents robust preliminary findings that warrant further exploration and validation in various contexts.

### 2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17771v1)
- **Authors**: Fabrizio Sandri, Elia Cunegatti, Giovanni Iacca
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time. The code is available at available at \url{https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/2SSP}.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a new Two-Stage Structured Pruning framework, abbreviated as 2SSP, aimed at optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing their size while maintaining performance. The first stage, Width Pruning, involves eliminating entire neurons based on their impact on output, preserving connections within the Feed-Forward Networks of the model. The second stage, Depth Pruning, focuses on removing entire Attention submodules through an iterative process that prioritizes those with minimal impact on metrics like perplexity. A novel mechanism is introduced to balance sparsity across both stages according to a targeted sparsity level. The authors validate 2SSP across multiple LLMs and sparsity configurations, showing consistent performance improvements over five state-of-the-art methods in language modeling and downstream tasks, while achieving significant gains in pruning efficiency. The code for the proposed approach is publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its integrated approach to pruning, combining two established methods (Width and Depth Pruning) to create a more effective structured pruning framework for LLMs. This dual approach is significant because it attempts to balance the trade-offs inherent in pruning by optimizing both the neuron level and the module level, which may not have been fully explored in prior work. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Methodological Contribution:** The two-stage framework is innovative and systematic, potentially offering a new pathway for efficient pruning in LLMs. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide extensive testing across various models and metrics, demonstrating robustness and general applicability. 3. **Performance Gain:** Achieving substantial gains in pruning time while maintaining or improving performance measures (such as perplexity) speaks to the practical applicability of their approach. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper discusses results across some languages and tasks, the depth of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, could be enhanced. Additionally, potential biases in the selection of datasets or models used for testing should be addressed. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed pruning mechanism might arguably introduce complexity that could be a barrier to its adoption in practice, particularly for practitioners less experienced with the intricacies of LLM architectures. In terms of its significance, the paper holds promise for influencing future research and application in model efficiency. However, the extent of its impact will heavily depend on the community's reception of the proposed methods and their comparative ease of implementation.  Given these considerations, I would assign the paper a **Score of 8**. This score reflects a strong contribution to the field of structured pruning in LLMs, characterized by a creative approach and solid results, while acknowledging certain limitations that could temper its immediate impact.  **Score: 8**

The incorporation of natural language input further simplifies the task of process parameters selection, enabling users to identify optimal settings specific to their build.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "AdditiveLLM: Large Language Models Predict Defects in Additive Manufacturing" investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to predict defect regimes in additive manufacturing based on process parameter inputs. The authors introduce a model called AdditiveLLM, which is fine-tuned using a defect dataset to classify defects such as Keyholing, Lack of Fusion, and Balling. They explore various input formatting methods and assess the model's predictive performance, revealing an accuracy of 93% on their Baseline dataset. The study highlights the advantages of using natural language inputs, which simplify the process of selecting optimal manufacturing parameters. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper tackles a novel application of LLMs in the area of additive manufacturing, specifically in defect prediction. Given the increasing reliance on machine learning tools in engineering domains, this work makes a significant contribution by demonstrating that LLMs can effectively handle the specificity required for predicting defects based on manufacturing processes. The integration of natural language processing (NLP) to aid users in parameter selection adds an innovative twist, making the technology more accessible. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to improve the quality of additive manufacturing processes.

More detailed benchmarking against existing models could strengthen the claims regarding the efficacy of AdditiveLLM. 3. **Broader Applicability:** The study could explore whether the methodology can be generalized to other manufacturing processes beyond those examined. **Overall Assessment:** While the paper demonstrates promising results and provides insights into a relevant problem in additive manufacturing, some aspects, like the dataset’s limitations and comparatives to existing techniques, need further elaboration. The innovative use of LLMs and natural language processing indicates a potential shift in how manufacturing defects can be predicted, making the work impactful. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid contribution to the field while acknowledging the areas that could benefit from further exploration and validation.

- **Authors**: Xiaokang Chen, Zhiyu Wu, Xingchao Liu, Zizheng Pan, Wen Liu, Zhenda Xie, Xingkai Yu, Chong Ruan
- **Abstract**: In this work, we introduce Janus-Pro, an advanced version of the previous work Janus. Specifically, Janus-Pro incorporates (1) an optimized training strategy, (2) expanded training data, and (3) scaling to larger model size. With these improvements, Janus-Pro achieves significant advancements in both multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following capabilities, while also enhancing the stability of text-to-image generation. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in the field. Code and models are publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Janus-Pro, an enhancement of the previous model Janus, designed for multimodal understanding and text-to-image tasks. Key improvements in Janus-Pro include an optimized training strategy, a larger dataset for training, and a scaled model architecture. These enhancements lead to notable improvements in understanding and instruction-following capabilities across modalities as well as in the stability of text-to-image generation. The authors aim for Janus-Pro to stimulate further research in this domain, with an assurance of publicly available resources for replication and further experimentation. **Evaluation:** The novelty of Janus-Pro lies primarily in its incremental enhancements over the foundational Janus model. The introduction of an optimized training strategy points towards an understanding of the challenges in training multimodal systems, reflecting a meaningful step in model development. However, the research does not provide substantial theoretical advancements or novel algorithms. The scaling of model size and the incorporation of broader datasets align with prevailing trends in the field of deep learning and multimodal research, which may reduce the perceived novelty as these approaches are increasingly being adopted across various systems. Furthermore, while the improvements in performance metrics are significant, the paper does not clearly delineate the comparative advantages over state-of-the-art systems beyond Janus. The contributions are indeed relevant and demonstrate a clear practical impact—improved stability and efficiency in text-to-image generation can address existing limitations; however, without rigorous benchmarking against a wide range of contemporary models, it is challenging to calibrate the full impact of these improvements. The significance in the field is moderate. Janus-Pro may inspire future research directions, particularly in refining multimodal systems, but it does not introduce novel theoretical frameworks or groundbreaking methodologies. The publication of code and models does add to its significance, promoting collaborative development and further experimentation in the community. In summary, Janus-Pro makes relevant advancements within its context but does not push the boundaries of the field dramatically. While it is a solid contribution, the impact feels limited due to the lack of novel theoretical insights or comparisons with other leading multimodal models. **Score: 6**

### Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17840v1)
- **Authors**: Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various tasks, yet their ability to extract and internalize deeper insights from domain-specific datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how continual pre-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for insight learning across three distinct forms: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic insights. Focusing on two critical domains: medicine and finance, we employ LoRA to train LLMs on two existing datasets. To evaluate each insight type, we create benchmarks to measure how well continual pre-training helps models go beyond surface-level knowledge. We also assess the impact of document modification on capturing insights. The results show that, while continual pre-training on original documents has a marginal effect, modifying documents to retain only essential information significantly enhances the insight-learning capabilities of LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the effectiveness of continual pre-training on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve their domain-specific insight learning capabilities in medicine and finance using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). It focuses on three types of insights: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic. The authors develop benchmarks to assess the models' ability to learn beyond surface-level knowledge and examine the impact of document modification on information capture. Results indicate a slight improvement with original documents; however, significant enhancements are achieved when documents are modified to highlight essential information. ### Evaluation: The novelty of this paper lies in its systematic approach to understanding how continual pre-training can deepen insight learning in LLMs, particularly in specialized fields. While research in LLMs is growing, the specific focus on domain-specific insights and the strategy of modifying documents introduce valuable aspects that contribute to the state of the art in natural language processing. **Strengths:** 1. **Focus on Insight Types:** By categorizing insights into declarative, statistical, and probabilistic, the study provides a nuanced view of what constitutes knowledge in LLMs. 2. **Domain-Specific Applications:** The application to medicine and finance highlights practical implications, suggesting that findings could lead to improved applications in crucial fields. 3. **Document Modification Strategy:** The innovative approach of modifying documents to emphasize essential information adds a fresh perspective to how data can be optimized for LLM learning. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Marginal Effect on Original Documents:** The study finds that original documents yield only marginal improvements, which may lead to questions about the practicality of continual pre-training, especially when compared to more effective methods of training. 2. **Limited Generalizability:** While the focus on just two domains (medicine and finance) is insightful, broader applications and potential generalizations to other domains remain underexplored. 3. **Evaluation Metrics:** The benchmarks created for assessment, while useful, may not fully encapsulate the depth of insight and understanding achievable by LLMs, potentially oversimplifying complex cognitive processes. ### Conclusion: Overall, the paper does make a meaningful contribution to the ongoing exploration of LLM capabilities, particularly in how continual pre-training can facilitate deeper insights. However, the limited generalizability and marginal results with original documents leave some room for improvement. The innovative aspects of the modification strategy are promising but would benefit from further validation across other datasets and domains. **Score: 7**

### Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17858v1)
- **Authors**: Rui Min, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Minhao Cheng, Min Lin
- **Abstract**: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging" investigates vulnerabilities in the voting mechanism of Chatbot Arena—a platform for comparing large language models (LLMs) through user voting on responses from pairwise battles of models. The authors argue that the current systems of crowdsourced voting can be manipulated to unfairly enhance or diminish the ranks of particular models. They propose a direct rigging strategy that centers on only new battles involving the target model, but find it impractical due to the low frequency of these battles. To address this, the authors introduce omnipresent rigging strategies that leverage the platform's Elo rating mechanism, which allows users to influence the target model’s ranking through votes on battles where the model does not participate. Experimental results show that these strategies can significantly enhance model rankings with a relatively small number of strategically cast votes. The authors also acknowledge potential defenses against such rigging and call for ongoing efforts to protect the integrity of voting on the platform. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The paper is notable for highlighting a systematic issue in a widely used evaluation platform for LLMs that has presumably gone unaddressed. The introduction of both target-only and omnipresent rigging strategies provides a unique perspective on how external voting mechanisms can be exploited. However, while the concept of voting manipulation is not inherently new, its application to a specific and popular context like Chatbot Arena adds valuable insight to understanding potential vulnerabilities in evaluation systems. **Significance:**  The implications of the findings are critical, as they pave the way for the development of mitigation strategies against vote rigging in crowdsourced evaluation platforms. The exposure of these vulnerabilities is vital for enhancing the credibility of model rankings, especially in a domain that increasingly relies on such platforms for assessing AI performance. **Strengths:** 1. The paper presents a clear problem statement, identifying the specific issue of vote rigging in a relevant domain. 2. It offers an innovative technical approach to manipulate rankings and provides empirical evidence. 3. The comprehensive testing on a large dataset (1.7 million historical votes) lends credibility to the results. **Weaknesses:** 1. The exploration of defense mechanisms against rigging is somewhat superficial and does not delve deeply into the feasibility or effectiveness of potential countermeasures. 2. The ethical implications of vote rigging could have been discussed more thoroughly, considering the potential for harm to the models and trust in the platform. 3. While the paper addresses practical inefficiencies in the direct vote rigging approach, it does not explore other mitigating strategies beyond rigging, limiting the breadth of the discussion. **Overall Assessment:** The paper makes an important contribution to the field by revealing exploitable weaknesses in the evaluation of LLMs and offering methods for manipulation. Its findings are significant, though the ethics and defense mechanisms could be better contextualized. The blend of clearly articulated methodology and empirical results bolsters its impact on improving the integrity of AI evaluation. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong contribution, but acknowledges the need for deeper exploration of ethical concerns and defenses, as well as the underlying novelty in the broader context of voting systems beyond just this application.

### Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17901v1)
- **Authors**: Jakub Adamczyk, Piotr Ludynia, Wojciech Czech
- **Abstract**: We study the effectiveness of molecular fingerprints for peptide property prediction and demonstrate that domain-specific feature extraction from molecular graphs can outperform complex and computationally expensive models such as GNNs, pretrained sequence-based transformers and multimodal ensembles, even without hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation on 126 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRGB and 5 other peptide function prediction benchmarks. We show that models based on count variants of ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit molecular fingerprints and LightGBM as classification head are remarkably robust. The strong performance of molecular fingerprints, which are intrinsically very short-range feature encoders, challenges the presumed importance of long-range interactions in peptides. Our conclusion is that the use of molecular fingerprints for larger molecules, such as peptides, can be a computationally feasible, low-parameter, and versatile alternative to sophisticated deep learning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Molecular Fingerprints Are Strong Models for Peptide Function Prediction" investigates the use of molecular fingerprints in predicting peptide properties and their functionality. The authors find that simple yet effective models based on molecular fingerprints outperform more complex models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and pretrained transformers across 126 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including the LRGB dataset. Their approach utilizes specific molecular fingerprints, such as ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints, combined with a LightGBM classifier. The findings challenge the prevailing belief regarding the necessity of capturing long-range interactions in peptides, suggesting that short-range features encoded by molecular fingerprints are sufficient for predictive tasks. The study emphasizes the computational efficiency and lower complexity of using molecular fingerprints over more sophisticated models. **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty**: The study presents a novel outlook on the utility of molecular fingerprints, which have traditionally been overshadowed by more advanced modeling techniques in peptide analysis. The re-evaluation of the importance of short-range features in the context of peptide function prediction is particularly noteworthy and raises pertinent questions about existing paradigms in the field.  2. **Significance**: The contribution is significant because it challenges the field's inclination towards complex computational models that require substantial resources. By demonstrating that simpler methods can yield competitive if not superior results, the paper addresses practical concerns regarding the implementation of machine learning in biochemical research, particularly where computational resources may be limited. 3. **Robustness of Findings**: The evaluation across 126 datasets and the achievement of state-of-the-art results on specific benchmarks reinforce the robustness of the findings. However, it would be helpful to understand how these methodologies perform in a broader array of biological contexts beyond the selected datasets. 4. **Limitations**: While the results are compelling, the analysis may overlook scenarios where longer-range interactions are indeed pivotal. The authors also do not extensively explore the implications of their findings for specific peptide classes or structural complexities, which could limit the universality of their conclusion. Moreover, the lack of hyperparameter tuning could be a strength in terms of generalization but also a weakness if future work is needed to refine these models. 5. **Potential Influence**: The research is positioned to influence future directions in the field, encouraging researchers to consider molecular fingerprints as viable alternatives to high-complexity models, especially in high-throughput scenarios. Overall, the paper holds significant merit in addressing current challenges in peptide function prediction and offers a persuasive argument for a paradigm shift in methodology. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the overall strength of the novel findings, the importance of its implications for future research, and the effective demonstration of performance in practical datasets. However, the acknowledged limitations and the need for a broader exploratory scope to confirm the proposed conclusions temper the impact somewhat, preventing a perfect score.

### DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17905v1)
- **Authors**: Mingkuan Feng, Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Pengpeng Shao, Ruihan Jin, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Feihu Che
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents DReSS, an innovative approach designed to streamline large language models (LLMs) by integrating a three-step process: regularization, pruning, and fine-tuning. Unlike traditional pruning methods that risk losing valuable information during the direct removal of parameters, DReSS employs data-driven regularization prior to pruning. This technique helps retain important model knowledge by transferring it to the remaining parameters, which minimizes performance degradation. The authors provide empirical evidence showing that DReSS achieves superior performance compared to conventional pruning methods, even under extreme reduction ratios, ultimately leading to lower latency and increased processing capabilities for LLMs. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces a paradigm shift in how parameter pruning is approached in LLMs, with its proposed method addressing a genuine gap in the existing body of knowledge. Existing techniques often overlook the critical information embedded in pruned parameters, leading to suboptimal model performance post-pruning. DReSS's focus on preemptive regularization before pruning is both novel and methodologically sound, theoretically reducing the loss of information and promoting efficiency. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The tripartite strategy of regularizing before pruning adds a valuable perspective to model optimization, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful approach to resource management in LLMs. 2. **Strong Experimental Validation:** The results demonstrate that DReSS not only outperforms prior techniques but does so under rigorous conditions, suggesting its robustness and applicability across various scenarios. 3. **Relevance:** As LLMs grow in size and complexity, the need for efficient models becomes critical. DReSS addresses this need, making it relevant for both academic researchers and industry practitioners. Weaknesses: 1. **Scalability Concerns:** While the provided experimental results are promising, they may not encompass every practical application, especially those with larger datasets or more diverse linguistic tasks. 2. **Limited Generalization:** The method relies on a small amount of data for regularization, which may not be feasible for all use cases or different model architectures, potentially limiting its applicability. Overall, the paper offers a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and natural language processing, particularly in optimizing LLMs by minimizing their computational and memory footprints while maintaining performance. The balance between innovation and empirical support enhances its credibility and relevance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial novelty and practical implications, while acknowledging some limitations regarding scalability and generalization. The potential impact in advancing the state-of-the-art in LLM efficiency makes it a noteworthy contribution.

Despite this growing attention, their applicability in culturally responsive Indigenous educational settings like Hawai`i's public schools and Kaiapuni (immersion language) programs, remains understudied. Additionally, `Olelo Hawai`i, the Hawaiian language, as a low-resource language, poses unique challenges and concerns about cultural sensitivity and the reliability of generated content. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), this study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of using LLMs for culturally revitalizing computer science (CS) education in Hawaiian public schools with Kaiapuni programs. Our findings highlight AI's time-saving advantages while exposing challenges such as cultural misalignment and reliability concerns. We conclude with design recommendations for future AI tools to better align with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical practices, towards the broader goal of trustworthy, effective, and culturally grounded AI technologies.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper examines the use of large language models (LLMs) in enhancing computer science (CS) education within Hawaiian schools, particularly in culturally immersive contexts like Kaiapuni programs. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), the research identifies key benefits of LLMs, such as their efficiency in curriculum development, while also highlighting concerns related to cultural misalignments and the reliability of content, especially given that `Olelo Hawai`i is a low-resource language. The authors advocate for the design of future AI tools that harmonize with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical methods, emphasizing the necessity for culturally responsible and effective AI technologies. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation**:  **Novelty**: This paper addresses a significant gap in the study of AI integration within Indigenous educational settings, particularly focusing on a low-resource language context. While there is existing literature on AI in education, the intersection of LLMs, cultural responsiveness, and Indigenous pedagogical frameworks is relatively unexplored. The study's findings contribute new insights regarding the specific concerns and advantages of utilizing AI in a culturally relevant manner. **Significance**: The implications of this research are substantial. By identifying the specific benefits and limitations that Hawaiian educators perceive in using LLMs, the study provides a foundational understanding that can inform future AI tool development aimed at supporting Indigenous education. Furthermore, the recommendations for aligning AI technologies with cultural values have important ramifications beyond Hawai`i, potentially guiding similar efforts in other Indigenous contexts. **Strengths**: The rigorous qualitative approach, including both surveys and interviews, lends credibility to the findings. The focus on culturally responsive education is timely and necessary, especially as AI technologies proliferate in various educational domains.  **Weaknesses**: While the paper successfully identifies critical concerns, it lacks empirical testing of the proposed recommendations. Additionally, the study could benefit from a broader comparative analysis with other Indigenous settings to bolster its conclusions. There is also a need for more detail on the methodologies used in data collection and analysis to enhance reproducibility.  **Potential Influence**: The paper could stimulate further research on LLM applications in diverse educational contexts, particularly within underrepresented languages and cultures. It sets the stage for important discussions around the ethical use of AI in education, especially concerning the preservation and revitalization of cultural identity. **Score Justification**: Considering the novelty of addressing a cultural context that has been largely overlooked in the AI education discourse, combined with practical implications for future tool development, I assign this paper a score of **8 out of 10**. This reflects its substantial contribution while acknowledging some limitations in empirical grounding and scope. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization," addresses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in solving mathematics problems, particularly the inefficiency of using lengthy reasoning chains for trivial questions. The authors introduce a novel approach named Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO) that allows models to more effectively allocate their reasoning resources based on the difficulty of queries. This framework reframes the problem as utility maximization under an inference budget constraint, enabling models to "understand" and adapt their inference efforts. The experimental results show significant performance improvements on the MATH500 benchmark, with enhancements of 4.14% and 5.74% absolute accuracy, and approximately doubled improvements compared to self-consistency techniques when varying inference budgets are applied. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The approach presented in this paper is quite innovative, as it introduces a new way of looking at inference budgets within large language models. While various methods have been explored to enhance reasoning through expanded length and complexity, the use of an inference budget as a constraint on mathematical problem-solving introduces a fresh paradigm. This adds value to the existing literature by addressing not just performance but the efficiency of reasoning processes. **Significance**: The implications of the IBPO algorithm are considerable. By enhancing the ability of models to distinguish between trivial and complex inquiries, this method could improve overall performance and reduce unnecessary computational expenditure. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where resource constraints are critical.  **Strengths**: - The paper’s formulation of the inference budget as a utility maximization problem is conceptually strong and presents a clear transition from optimization-focused reasoning to a more situationally aware approach. - Empirical results show clear advancements over established techniques, supporting the proposed method's effectiveness. **Weaknesses**: - While the results are promising, a critical assessment of potential limitations in diverse problem types beyond mathematical inquiries could strengthen the paper’s foundation. - The methods for determining the effectiveness of inference budgets could be elaborated further; the authors do not fully explore how different types of models might react to this new framework. - There could be potential reduction in performance gain on more complex queries or under different conditions that warrant investigation. **Potential Influence**: This paper could influence further research into resource-aware reasoning in language models, encourage the development of hybrid models that balance inference length with understanding, and lead to new benchmarks for evaluating model performance in problem-solving contexts. Given these considerations, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field and opens avenues for future research, balanced against its limitations. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) contain substantial factual knowledge which is commonly elicited by multiple-choice question-answering prompts. Internally, such models process the prompt through multiple transformer layers, building varying representations of the problem within its hidden states. Ultimately, however, only the hidden state corresponding to the final layer and token position are used to predict the answer label. In this work, we propose instead to learn a small separate neural network predictor module on a collection of training questions, that take the hidden states from all the layers at the last temporal position as input and outputs predictions. In effect, such a framework disentangles the representational abilities of LLMs from their predictive abilities. On a collection of hard benchmarks, our method achieves considerable improvements in performance, sometimes comparable to supervised fine-tuning procedures, but at a fraction of the computational cost.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "InnerThoughts: Disentangling Representations and Predictions in Large Language Models" addresses the inefficiencies in how large language models (LLMs) generate predictions from their internal representations. Current methods primarily utilize the final hidden state for prediction, neglecting the potentially rich information stored in hidden states from previous layers. The authors propose an alternative approach wherein a separate neural network is trained to process all hidden states from the last time step, allowing for a more comprehensive use of the model's internal representations. This method demonstrates significant performance enhancements on various difficult benchmarks, achieving results comparable to those of supervised fine-tuning while being more computationally efficient. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a novel architecture by separating the representation and prediction tasks within LLMs, which is a distinct shift from traditional methodologies that rely solely on the final layer's output. This disentangling of representation from prediction is an innovative approach that could lead to better utilization of the model's resources. While there have been efforts to exploit intermediate representations, systematically using outputs from all hidden states to enhance prediction stands out. **Significance:** The findings indicate that improved performance can be achieved without the prohibitive costs associated with full fine-tuning. By potentially democratizing access to highly performant models by lowering computational requirements, the work has implications for researchers and practitioners who may struggle with resource constraints. Additionally, the concept might inspire further research into modular neural network designs and the application of intermediate layer representations in various tasks beyond just language modeling. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Design:** The separation of representation and prediction offers a new way to interact with LLMs. 2. **Performance Gains:** The reported improvements are substantial when compared to conventional methods, indicating the method's practical applicability. 3. **Resource Efficiency:** The emphasis on maintaining high performance while reducing computational costs makes this research highly relevant amid growing environmental and economic concerns over large-scale model training. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** The framework's effectiveness across different types of tasks and LLM architectures remains to be fully explored. [Specificity of the experiments could be lacking, necessitating further validation.] 2. **Dependence on Data:** The reliance on a collection of training questions could limit the method's utility if similar datasets are not available. 3. **Complexity:** Introducing another layer of computation with a separate predictor might complicate the model's architecture, valued in simple deployment scenarios. Given these considerations, while the paper exhibits originality and addresses a relevant issue in the field, its novelty might not be revolutionary. However, it provides significant value by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of existing models without demanding extensive computational resources. **Score: 8**

### Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation Generated Stack Traces
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18005v1)
- **Authors**: Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer
- **Abstract**: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation Generated Stack Traces" addresses the problem of diagnosing software crashes, particularly in production environments where only crash logs and stack traces are available. Traditional methods often rely on test failures and source code, making them less applicable in these contexts. The authors propose a novel solution that utilizes large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned solely on stack trace information, bypassing the need for additional runtime context. To enhance the dataset for fine-tuning, the authors generate synthetic crash data by introducing mutations into the HANA code base, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 64,369 crashes from 4.1 million mutations. Their approach demonstrates a significant improvement in fault localization accuracy, achieving 66.9% compared to baseline models that showed substantially lower accuracies (12.6% and 10.6%). The generalizability of their method is further validated through tests on additional databases (SQLite and DuckDB), yielding accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Overall, the paper highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs for fault localization in environments where traditional methods struggle. ### Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The paper introduces a unique methodology by fine-tuning LLMs specifically for fault localization using only stack trace information, making it a valuable contribution to the field of software debugging. 2. **Methodology**: The use of synthetic crash generation through code mutation is inventive and allows the authors to create a robust training dataset, addressing the limitation of insufficient historical crash data. 3. **Results**: The significant accuracy improvement over traditional methods exemplifies the potential applicability of LLMs in real-world scenarios, especially in production environments where rapid diagnostics are critical. 4. **Generalizability**: The evaluation on multiple open-source datasets strengthens the claim that the developed method is widely applicable beyond the specific context of SAP HANA. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability and Efficiency**: While the accuracy improvements are substantial, the paper does not address the computational cost or the practical deployment of the fine-tuned models in a production environment, which are crucial considerations for industry adoption. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The reliance on accuracy as a primary measure may overlook other important factors, such as the model's ability to diagnose multiple failures or the relevance of inferred root causes to actual deployments. 3. **Limited Context**: By focusing solely on stack traces, the approach might miss context-dependent information that could sometimes lead to more effective fault localization strategies, such as the nature of the input data or system state during the crash. **Potential Influence**: This work could inspire further research into leveraging LLMs for other forms of software diagnostics and fault localization, possibly encouraging the exploration of context-rich or multi-modal data approaches. However, without thorough investigation into practical deployment scenarios, the immediate impact may be constrained. **Score Justification**: Given the paper's innovative approach, strong empirical results, and practical implications, it makes a notable contribution to the field. However, the gaps present in terms of scalability and broader contextual understanding slightly diminish its impact. Overall, the unique application of LLMs to the domain of fault localization, coupled with robust experimental validation, leads to a respectable score. Score: **8**

### Large Language Models Think Too Fast To Explore Effectively
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18009v1)
- **Authors**: Lan Pan, Hanbo Xie, Robert C. Wilson
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models have emerged many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore, an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with those traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Large Language Models Think Too Fast To Explore Effectively" investigates the exploratory capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in the context of open-ended tasks. Using the game Little Alchemy 2 as a framework, the authors test if LLMs can outperform humans in discovering new combinations of elements. The results indicate that while most LLMs underperform compared to humans, the o1 model shows potential. The study identifies that traditional LLMs predominantly apply uncertainty-driven strategies, straying from the human balance of uncertainty and empowerment. Furthermore, a representational analysis using Sparse Autoencoders reveals that LLMs process uncertainty and choice earlier than empowerment values, leading to rapid decisions that impair effective exploration. This research highlights the limitations of LLMs in exploration and suggests avenues for enhancing their performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel and intriguing exploration of an area that has received insufficient attention: the exploratory behavior of large language models. It goes beyond typical assessments of LLMs focused on performance metrics to delve into their ability to engage in genuine exploration—a foundational trait in both human cognition and artificial intelligence. **Strengths:** 1. **Originality**: The focus on exploration in LLMs, particularly in an open-ended task, contributes fresh insights to the literature, addressing an important aspect of AI behavior that impacts adaptability and information discovery. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The use of representational analysis to uncover the distinct processing dynamics within LLMs offers a robust insight into their operational frameworks, providing a measurable differentiation between human cognitive strategies and machine learning approaches. 3. **Implications for Improvement**: By demonstrating that LLMs’ rapid decision-making leads to poor exploratory outcomes, the paper opens avenues for future research aimed at improving LLM adaptability through adjusted processing strategies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Application**: The findings are primarily contextualized within a single game (Little Alchemy 2). While the results are significant, the generalization to broader applications and real-world scenarios may be limited without additional empirical validation across different domains. 2. **Limited Model Diversity**: The analysis appears to focus more on a specific LLM (o1 model) without deeper comparative insights into why some models perform better. A broader analysis of multiple LLM architectures could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. 3. **Ambiguity in Empowerment Definition**: The concept of "empowerment" could be elaborated further to clarify its operationalization and implications within the exploratory context. **Overall Significance**: This paper holds substantial relevance in the ongoing discussion about the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, pushing the boundaries of understanding beyond mere task performance to cognitive processes akin to human exploration. While it showcases significant contributions, the limitations in scope and generalization might reduce its immediate impact. **Score: 8**  The score reflects a commendable contribution to the field with high originality and implications for future research but acknowledges the need for broader application and additional comparative frameworks for greater generalizability and impact.

- **Authors**: Jonas M Kübler, Yu-Xiang Wang, Shoham Sabach, Navid Ansari, Matthäus Kleindessner, Kailash Budhathoki, Volkan Cevher, George Karypis
- **Abstract**: Recent hardware advancements in AI Accelerators and GPUs allow to efficiently compute sparse matrix multiplications, especially when 2 out of 4 consecutive weights are set to zero. However, this so-called 2:4 sparsity usually comes at a decreased accuracy of the model. We derive a regularizer that exploits the local correlation of features to find better sparsity masks in trained models. We minimize the regularizer jointly with a local squared loss by deriving the proximal operator for which we show that it has an efficient solution in the 2:4-sparse case. After optimizing the mask, we use maskedgradient updates to further minimize the local squared loss. We illustrate our method on toy problems and apply it to pruning entire large language models up to 70B parameters. On models up to 13B we improve over previous state of the art algorithms, whilst on 70B models we match their performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces a novel proximal operator designed to induce 2:4-sparsity in neural network models, a format particularly well-suited for efficient computation on modern hardware such as AI Accelerators and GPUs. This sparsity method preserves every 2 out of 4 consecutive weights as zero, which, while enhancing computational efficiency, often results in a drop in model accuracy. To mitigate this, the authors propose a regularizer that leverages local feature correlations to optimize sparsity patterns more effectively. They tackle the problem by jointly minimizing this regularizer alongside a local squared loss, deriving an efficient solution for the 2:4-sparse configuration. Additionally, they enhance the optimization process through masked gradient updates. The method demonstrates improved performance over existing algorithms on various toy problems and large language models up to 70 billion parameters, achieving state-of-the-art results on models up to 13 billion parameters and matching the performance of competitive approaches at larger scales. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper presents a significant computational advancement in the context of neural network optimization by focusing on 2:4 sparsity, which has not been extensively studied in the realm of model pruning before. The establishment of a proximal operator specifically tailored for this form of sparsity, along with a method to leverage local feature correlations, adds a fresh perspective to the optimization landscape in deep learning.  **Methodology:** The authors’ integration of a regularization approach with efficient computational techniques reveals an innovative blend that optimizes model performance while reducing complexity. Employing masked gradient updates is particularly noteworthy, as this demonstrates an effective method for further refining the model post-mask optimization. **Strengths:** 1. **Performance Gains:** The algorithm shows tangible benefits in real-world applications, particularly impressive on larger models, indicating practical utility. 2. **Practicality in High Dimensional Contexts:** The focus on large language models aligns the findings with ongoing trends in AI, showcasing its immediate relevance to current research debates and practical developments. 3. **Clear Experimental Validation:** The inclusion of thorough empirical results strengthens the paper's claims and showcases the method’s applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity in Implementation:** While providing an efficient operator, the practical implementation of combining techniques may present challenges for broader adoption without clear, step-by-step guidelines. 2. **Potential Trade-offs:** While aiming for improved performance, the paper does not deeply explore the specific accuracy drops associated with traditional sparsity methods when compared to their approach, potentially obscuring a comprehensive understanding of trade-offs involved. 3. **Limited Scope of Exploration:** The focus on 2:4-sparsity may overlook other forms of sparsity that might yield competitive or better outcomes, necessitating further exploration of different configurations. **Significance:** The work contributes valuable insights into model efficiency that are crucial in the current landscape of deep learning, particularly as models continue to scale. It holds promise for bridging the gap between performance and computational efficiency, a critical consideration for deploying AI systems in real-world applications. **Overall Assessment:** Given its novel approach, empirical validation, and potential implications for large-scale models, this paper holds a considerable significance in the field. However, the complexities and trade-offs involved raise questions that warrant further investigation.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong contributions and relevance while acknowledging areas that require further exploration and a consideration of implementation challenges.

### SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18052v1)
- **Authors**: Bartosz Cywiński, Kamil Deja
- **Abstract**: Recent machine unlearning approaches offer promising solution for removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models. However, traditional methods, which largely rely on fine-tuning, provide little insight into the changes they introduce to the base model, making it unclear whether concepts are truly removed or only masked. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to unlearn unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a method of selecting concept-specific features. This enables precise interventions on the model's activations to block targeted content while preserving the model's overall performance. Evaluation on the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron dismisses the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents SAeUron, a method designed to enable interpretable concept unlearning in diffusion models using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). Traditional machine unlearning strategies often lack transparency, leading to ambiguity about whether undesired concepts are genuinely removed or merely masked. SAeUron addresses this by employing features extracted from SAEs trained on the activations of a diffusion model, which capture interpretable, sparse representations of concepts. The authors propose targeted interventions on model activations to effectively block specific unwanted content while maintaining the model's overall efficacy. SAeUron is evaluated against the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, showing superior performance in unlearning both object and style concepts. Notably, it also demonstrates the capability to eliminate multiple concepts at once and mitigates the risk of generating unwanted content, even in adversarial contexts. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper introduces a novel approach to the increasingly relevant issue of concept removal in machine learning, particularly with respect to diffusion models, which are central in the domains of image generation and manipulation.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Methodology**: The use of sparse autoencoders to track interpretable features provides a significant advancement over traditional fine-tuning methods. By ensuring that specific features associated with unwanted concepts can be accurately targeted, this could pave the way for more reliable and interpretable unlearning approaches in AI.     2. **Evaluation Against Benchmark**: The application and evaluation of SAeUron using the UnlearnCanvas benchmark lend credibility to its effectiveness and relevance within contemporary research. 3. **Addressing Multiple Concepts**: The ability to unlearn multiple concepts simultaneously is a clear advantage, suggesting practical utility in complex applications where multiple undesired outputs need to be controlled. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality and Applicability**: While the method shows promise on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, the efficacy in more complex real-world scenarios or various model architectures isn't discussed. Generalizability across diverse diffusion models or tasks remains unexamined. 2. **Adversarial Robustness**: Although SAeUron claims to mitigate the risk of generating unwanted content even under attack, the paper would benefit from clearer empirical evidence showcasing how robust it is in realistic adversarial settings. 3. **Concept Interpretation**: The interpretation of "concepts" is somewhat abstract, and it may vary significantly across different applications. The paper would be stronger with a detailed exposition on how concepts are defined, selected, and modified. **Conclusion and Score**: While SAeUron provides a compelling and innovative approach to concept unlearning, the potential limitations regarding generalized applicability and the real-world robustness of the method hold it back from being an unparalleled advancement. Thus, while it makes a meaningful contribution to its niche, especially concerning interpretability, it does not yet reach the pinnacle of groundbreaking research that could transform the broader machine learning landscape. **Score: 7**

### RL-based Query Rewriting with Distilled LLM for online E-Commerce Systems
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18056v1)
- **Authors**: Duy A. Nguyen, Rishi Kesav Mohan, Van Yang, Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang
- **Abstract**: Query rewriting (QR) is a critical technique in e-commerce search, addressing the lexical gap between user queries and product descriptions to enhance search performance. Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories: discriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models (LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language understanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative LLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and cost in online settings. These limitations force offline deployment, making them vulnerable to issues like information staleness and semantic drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline for QR that balances efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach combines offline knowledge distillation to create a lightweight but efficient student model with online reinforcement learning (RL) to refine query rewriting dynamically using real-time feedback. A key innovation is the use of LLMs as simulated human feedback, enabling scalable reward signals and cost-effective evaluation without manual annotations. Experimental results on Amazon ESCI dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, as well as positive feedback from the LLM simulation. This work contributes to advancing LLM capabilities for domain-specific applications, offering a robust solution for dynamic and complex e-commerce search environments.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to query rewriting (QR) in e-commerce systems, addressing limitations inherent in both discriminative and generative models. Traditional discriminative models struggle with understanding and flexibility, while generative models using large language models (LLMs) face challenges such as high latency and costs, making them unsuitable for real-time applications. The proposed hybrid pipeline uses offline knowledge distillation to develop a lightweight student model and incorporates online reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically refine query rewrites based on real-time feedback. A unique aspect of the method is the use of LLMs as a source of simulated human feedback for generating scalable reward signals. The experimental results on the Amazon ESCI dataset indicate significant improvements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, marking a step forward in leveraging LLMs for specific applications. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper brings forth a notable synthesis of offline and online methodologies, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of query rewriting in e-commerce environments. The key contributions include the use of RL for dynamic feedback adaptation and the innovative application of LLMs as simulated human feedback, which effectively addresses the shortcomings of existing models. The experimental results substantiate the claims with quantitative measures of improvement, indicating that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in significant ways. However, there are certain weaknesses worth considering. Firstly, while the current implementation shows promise, the scalability of the approach across diverse e-commerce platforms remains to be validated further. Moreover, the paper does not sufficiently address potential ethical implications of deploying RL-based systems in consumer-facing applications, such as biases that might arise from the use of LLMs.  Additionally, the novelty of combining knowledge distillation and RL in this specific way, while beneficial, is not entirely groundbreaking in the context of machine learning research. Other fields have seen similar approaches, albeit not within the e-commerce domain, which limits the paper's uniqueness. Overall, the work presents a solid advancement towards improving QR systems in e-commerce, leveraging state-of-the-art methodologies in a novel combination. The practical implications and improvements observed lend it significant relevance, but its existing gaps in scalability and ethical considerations potentially dampen its broader impact. **Score: 7**

The primary challenges include hand-spreading metrics, adhering to standard accounting and corporate valuation conventions, and performing analysis under incomplete information - particularly in multi-step tasks requiring assumption generation. This performance gap highlights the disconnect between existing LLM capabilities and the demands of professional financial analysis that are inadequately tested by current testing architectures. Results show that higher-quality training data is needed to support such tasks, which we experiment with using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. FinanceQA is publicly released at [this https URL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AfterQuery/FinanceQA).

- **Authors**: Pratik S. Sachdeva, Tom van Nuenen
- **Abstract**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of this research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess how well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or political ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to relatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and nuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along more detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better assess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this end, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on everyday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to assign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We then compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to each other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results demonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral judgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit. LLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model agreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in how models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the complexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and the need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical judgment. As LLMs continue to be used in roles requiring ethical decision-making such as therapists and companions, careful evaluation is crucial to mitigate potential biases and limitations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas" investigates the moral reasoning of large language models (LLMs) by analyzing their responses to complex moral dilemmas sourced from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) subreddit. The study contrasts the moral judgments and explanations of seven LLMs against those provided by Reddit users, aiming to identify patterns in the models' moral reasoning. Findings indicate that LLMs display distinct and varied patterns of moral judgment, often misaligning with human perspectives. The authors emphasize the low inter-model agreement in moral assessments and highlight a moderate to high consistency within individual models. The paper calls for deeper assessments of LLMs concerning moral decision-making, especially given their increasing deployment in sensitive roles. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to evaluate LLMs using real-world, everyday moral dilemmas rather than traditional survey-style questions. It shifts the focus from superficial assessments, allowing for a nuanced understanding of moral reasoning in AI. The authors’ decision to utilize content from a popular online community lends relevancy and depth to their findings, contributing significantly to the discourse on the ethical implications of employing LLMs in contexts requiring moral judgment. However, the study's reliance on a specific dataset may limit the generalizability of its conclusions. The moral dilemmas drawn from AITA represent a subset of societal moral reasoning that may not capture the broader spectrum of ethical considerations. Additionally, while the findings showcase the distinctions in model judgment, the analysis may benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the underlying factors that lead to the observed differences. The paper underscores vital implications for the development and deployment of LLMs, particularly in roles where ethical implications are prominent—such as in mental health or companionship scenarios. This relevance amplifies its significance within the field of AI ethics. The call to critically evaluate the moral reasoning of LLMs is timely and essential, considering the rapid integration of AI systems into daily human interactions. Given its innovative approach, the relevancy of its findings, and the potential for significant impact on the development and application of LLMs, I would assign the paper a score of **8**. This score reflects its strong contributions while acknowledging the limitations in scope and the need for further research to solidify its findings across diverse ethical contexts. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18094v1)
- **Authors**: Da Chang, Yu Li, Ganzhao Yuan
- **Abstract**: In the training of large language models (LLMs), updating parameters more efficiently and stably has always been an important challenge. To achieve efficient parameter updates, existing methods usually achieve performance comparable to full parameter updates through methods such as low-dimensional decomposition or layer-wise selective updates. In this work, we propose AlphaAdam, an optimization framework for LLM from the perspective of intra-layer parameter updates. By decoupling parameter updates and dynamically adjusting their strength, AlphaAdam accelerates convergence and improves training stability. We construct parameter masks based on the consistency of historical momentum and gradient direction and combine them with an adaptive mask strength strategy to ensure efficient optimization and theoretical convergence guarantees, which is also applicable to most momentum-based optimizers. Extensive experiments show that AlphaAdam outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as AdamW in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency across tasks, including GPT-2 pre-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa and Llama-7B. Our AlphaAdam implements an optimizer enhancement framework for LLMs through intra-layer asynchronous masked adaptive updates. Our code is available in this \href{https://github.com/MaeChd/AlphaAdam}{link}

The framework is available for public use, indicating a commitment to facilitating further research and development. **Evaluation:** The novelty of AlphaAdam lies in its approach to intra-layer optimization through dynamic parameter masks. This addresses a critical need in the field for improvements in training efficiency and stability during the optimization of LLMs. By focusing on consistency in historical momentum and gradient direction, the authors have proposed a strategy that could potentially reduce the burden of full parameter updates while maintaining performance. Strengths: - The framework's focus on efficiency and stability addresses crucial challenges in training large-scale models, making it relevant to ongoing research in neural network optimization. - The theoretical guarantees provided alongside the empirical results add robustness to the claims of the optimization method's effectiveness. - The comparative analysis with existing methods like AdamW presents clear evidence of the superiority of AlphaAdam in specific contexts.

- **Abstract**: We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver), an innovative approach that enables large language models (LLMs) to perform multimodal tasks—specifically image, video, and audio captioning—without requiring additional training on task-specific data. Through a method that capitalizes on the LLM's inherent multi-step reasoning capabilities, MILS generates candidate outputs which are scored and iteratively refined to yield satisfactory solutions. This technique not only results in state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot captioning tasks but also enhances media generation, facilitating improvements in text-to-image generation and style transfer editing. Moreover, MILS serves as a gradient-free optimization method that can convert multimodal embeddings into text, allowing for operations like cross-modal arithmetic. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Simplicity**: The approach is characterized by its training-free nature, which simplifies multimodal integration for existing LLMs, making it accessible and usable across a wider range of applications. 2. **State-of-the-Art Performance**: The claim of achieving new benchmarks in zero-shot captioning is significant, indicating that existing LLMs can be adapted to multimodal tasks without extensive re-engineering. 3. **Versatility**: MILS shows versatility by applying to both captioning and media generation, which could lead to practical advancements in fields such as content creation and interactive AI. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Rigorous Evaluation**: While the paper claims enhanced performance, it would benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis against benchmarks and existing methods to substantiate its advantages. 2. **Generalizability**: The paper does not extensively address how well it scales to various LLM architectures or larger datasets, which could limit its applicability in practice. 3. **Computational Efficiency**: While the gradient-free approach is a strength, the iterative feedback mechanism may introduce computational inefficiencies that could restrict practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. **Impact on the Field:** MILS has the potential to influence the development of multimodal systems significantly, as it eliminates the need for training separate models, thus streamlining workflows. However, solid proof of its performance and advantages in diverse contexts would solidify its standing. **Conclusion:** Given the paper's innovative framework, the demonstration of state-of-the-art results in a training-free methodology, and its practical applications paired with some identified weaknesses, I would assign a score of 7. This score reflects a meaningful contribution to the field but highlights the necessity for more robust validation of its claims and broader applicability. **Score: 7**

### Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18099v1)
- **Authors**: Swarnadeep Saha, Xian Li, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Jason Weston, Tianlu Wang
- **Abstract**: LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge" introduces a novel methodology, called EvalPlanner, aimed at enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) when serving as evaluators. Current models (referred to as LLM-as-a-Judge) typically produce reasoning traces needed for evaluating responses, but they suffer from limitations due to reliance on predefined components and intertwined planning and reasoning phases. EvalPlanner addresses these issues by proposing a preference optimization algorithm that generates evaluation plans independently of existing constraints, followed by the execution of these plans leading to a final judgment. The approach employs a self-training loop where it iteratively refines these evaluation plans based on synthetically constructed data. The experiments demonstrate that EvalPlanner achieves superior performance on the RewardBench benchmark, suggesting improved effectiveness in generating final verdicts with reduced training data. Further validation across various benchmarks (RM-Bench, JudgeBench, FollowBenchEval) underscores the significance of dedicated planning in developing reliable LLM reasoning models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper presents an innovative approach to structuring the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in the context of evaluations. The shift from hand-designed components to an unconstrained evaluation planning process is significant, as it introduces a more flexible and potentially more effective groundwork for model training. This could represent a step towards more autonomous and robust evaluative frameworks within AI. **Significance**: The performance improvements showcased in RewardBench, combined with successful validation across multiple additional benchmarks, affirm the practical impact of the proposed method. By solving a tangible problem in generating quality evaluations without the need for extensive human-annotated datasets, the paper addresses key challenges in the LLM landscape. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of EvalPlanner embodies a novel algorithmic strategy that separates evaluation planning from execution, a distinction that could lead to more effective reasoning outputs. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The provision of state-of-the-art results lends credibility to the claims made in the paper, indicating a solid benchmarking methodology. 3. **Broad Applicability**: The approach’s effectiveness across multiple benchmarks suggests that its principles can be generalized, enhancing the relevance of the work in the field. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Synthetic Data Concerns**: While using synthetically generated data can expedite research, it also raises concerns regarding the data's representativeness of real-world scenarios, which may lead to overfitting or outputs that lack generalizability. 2. **Limited Exploration of Constraints**: The paper primarily emphasizes the unconstrained generation of reasoning plans without fully exploring whether certain constraints might enhance performance or address edge cases in evaluation scenarios. 3. **Cognitive Replication**: While the paper presents a robust model, it may warrant further discussion on how closely the approach mimics human reasoning in evaluation tasks—a defining characteristic for evaluative criteria. Overall, while the paper makes a notable contribution to the field of AI evaluators by presenting a new methodology and achieving strong results, there remain considerations regarding the implications of synthetic data and the nature of reasoning parallels it draws with human cognition. **Score: 8** The score of 8 reflects a substantial contribution to the understanding and effectiveness of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks, while also acknowledging areas that require further exploration and validation. The work stands out for its innovation and empirical backing but is tempered by potential concerns about the use of synthetic data and its implications on real-world applicability.

### Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100v1)
- **Authors**: Yibo Wang, Tiansheng Huang, Li Shen, Huanjin Yao, Haotian Luo, Rui Liu, Naiqiang Tan, Jiaxing Huang, Dacheng Tao
- **Abstract**: Harmful fine-tuning attack introduces significant security risks to the fine-tuning services. Mainstream defenses aim to vaccinate the model such that the later harmful fine-tuning attack is less effective. However, our evaluation results show that such defenses are fragile -- with a few fine-tuning steps, the model still can learn the harmful knowledge. To this end, we do further experiment and find that an embarrassingly simple solution -- adding purely random perturbations to the fine-tuned model, can recover the model from harmful behavior, though it leads to a degradation in the model's fine-tuning performance. To address the degradation of fine-tuning performance, we further propose Panacea, which optimizes an adaptive perturbation that will be applied to the model after fine-tuning. Panacea maintains model's safety alignment performance without compromising downstream fine-tuning performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different harmful ratios, fine-tuning tasks and mainstream LLMs, where the average harmful scores are reduced by up-to 21.5%, while maintaining fine-tuning performance. As a by-product, we analyze the optimized perturbation and show that different layers in various LLMs have distinct safety coefficients. Source code available at https://github.com/w-yibo/Panacea
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation" addresses the security threat posed by harmful fine-tuning attacks on large language models (LLMs). Traditional defense mechanisms attempt to immunize models against these attacks but often fail after minimal further fine-tuning. The authors propose a novel solution, Panacea, which introduces adaptive random perturbations to the model after fine-tuning to mitigate harmful behaviors without greatly sacrificing fine-tuning performance. They present comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrating that Panacea effectively reduces harmful behavior (up to 21.5% reduction in average harmful scores) while maintaining fine-tuning effectiveness across various tasks and LLMs. The study also reveals insights into the varying safety coefficients of different layers in LLMs, contributing to the understanding of model vulnerabilities. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**:  1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of using perturbations post-fine-tuning is a relatively novel approach in the context of securing LLMs against harmful fine-tuning. Most existing solutions focus primarily on preemptive measures, making this work distinct in its methodology. 2. **Impact on Security**: Given the increasing deployment of LLMs in sensitive applications, addressing security vulnerabilities is paramount. By successfully demonstrating a method that maintains model performance while significantly mitigating risks, this paper addresses a critical gap in the field. 3. **Robust Experiments**: The comprehensive experimental results lend credibility to the proposed solution. The variation across different harmful ratios and tasks showcases the robustness of Panacea, further establishing its practical relevance. 4. **Insightful Findings**: The analysis of layer-specific safety coefficients offers valuable information that could guide future research in model architecture and safety, contributing to the broader discourse on AI safety and alignment. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Performance Trade-off**: The paper acknowledges a degradation in fine-tuning performance due to the application of perturbations. While it claims to optimize performance, the details on how significant this degradation is—relative to the enhancements in safety—could be more thoroughly explored. 2. **Generalizability**: Although the experiments cover various LLM architectures, the extent to which the findings generalize to other models or applications outside the tested parameters might require further validation. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: While perturbations might be simple in concept, practical deployment for real-world LLM applications could pose challenges, especially in terms of tuning the adaptive perturbations optimally. Overall, the paper presents a compelling and resourceful method to enhance the safety of LLMs against fine-tuning attacks, marking a significant contribution to the field of AI security.  **Score**: 8

### Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18107v1)
- **Authors**: Song Bian, Minghao Yan, Shivaram Venkataraman
- **Abstract**: Scaling laws are powerful tools to predict the performance of large language models. However, current scaling laws fall short of accounting for inference costs. In this work, we first show that model architecture affects inference latency, where models of the same size can have up to 3.5x difference in latency. To tackle this challenge, we modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to co-optimize the model parameter count, the number of training tokens, and the model architecture. Due to the reason that models of similar training loss exhibit gaps in downstream evaluation, we also propose a novel method to train inference-efficient models based on the revised scaling laws. We perform extensive empirical studies to fit and evaluate our inference-aware scaling laws. We vary model parameters from 80M to 1B, training tokens from 1.6B to 30B, and model shapes, training a total of 63 models. Guided by our inference-efficient scaling law and model selection method, we release the Morph-1B model, which improves inference latency by 1.8x while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks compared to open-source models, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy-latency tradeoff.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models" addresses an important gap in current scaling laws for language models, specifically their neglect of inference costs. The authors reveal that variations in model architecture, even among models of equal size, can lead to significant differences in inference latency. They introduce modifications to the Chinchilla scaling laws to jointly optimize model parameters, training tokens, and architecture to enhance inference efficiency. By conducting empirical research with 63 models—varying in parameters and training data—they develop and validate new scaling laws that account for inference efficiency. Their practical application leads to the creation of the Morph-1B model, which demonstrates a 1.8x improvement in inference latency while maintaining competitive accuracy on downstream tasks, effectively advancing the balance between accuracy and latency. **Critical Evaluation:** The study makes a notable contribution to the field of natural language processing (NLP) by expanding upon established scaling laws to incorporate inference efficiency, an essential aspect as models grow larger, potentially impacting application usability in real-time scenarios. The recognition that architecture matters significantly for latency is a valuable insight that challenges the homogeneity with which models of equivalent size are often compared in existing literature. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: By integrating architectural considerations into the scaling laws, the paper provides a refreshing perspective that has not been widely addressed in previous literature. 2. **Comprehensive Empirical Analysis**: The extensive experimentation enhances the reliability of the results, offering a strong basis for their claims. 3. **Practical Application**: The release of Morph-1B, which demonstrates tangible benefits, is significant for researchers and practitioners looking to optimize language models for real-world use cases. Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the findings are grounded in specific models and parameters, the applicability of the proposed scaling laws across other architectures or domain-specific tasks remains uncertain.  2. **Lack of Theoretical Underpinnings**: The paper primarily focuses on empirical results; however, more theoretical support explaining why these architectural choices lead to latency reductions would strengthen the work's impact. 3. **Limited Comparison with Existing Models**: While Morph-1B shows improvements, more comparative analysis against a broader range of open-source models would bolster the claims of superiority. Overall, the paper successfully fills a crucial gap and offers practical advancements in the discipline. Its contributions toward integrating inference costs into the evaluation of language models are significant and could influence future research directions. **Score: 8**  The score reflects a good balance between novelty in the approach taken and the significance of potential applications in the field, while acknowledging that some aspects of the findings may require further validation to assess their broader implications.

- **Authors**: Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, Kai He, Zhen Peng, Fangzhi Xu, Ling Huang, Jingying Ma, Mengling Feng
- **Abstract**: Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a novel approach to integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a two-stage framework that employs self-supervised quantized representations (SSQR). It addresses the challenges stemming from the structural discrepancies between KGs and natural language. The SSQR method compresses the structural and semantic knowledge of KGs into discrete codes, aligning them with the token-based format of natural language sentences used by LLMs. The framework includes the generation of KG instruction-following data that utilizes these learned codes as features for direct input into LLMs. Experimental results indicate that SSQR significantly outperforms existing unsupervised quantization methods, yielding more distinguishable codes and enhancing the performance of fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 models on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks while using significantly fewer tokens per entity. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Potential Impact:** The paper tackles a pressing problem—the integration of structured knowledge from KGs into the unstructured paradigms of LLMs—demonstrating a clever use of quantization and self-supervised learning techniques. This cross-disciplinary approach is timely and potentially transformative, as it proposes a method to leverage the inherent knowledge encapsulated in KGs without the extensive demand for tokens typical in conventional inputs.  Moreover, the results showing improved performance on specific tasks, like link prediction and classification, with fewer tokens indicate a cutting-edge step towards more efficient LLM applications. By compressing knowledge into quantized representations, the authors address scalability and efficiency, which are critical concerns in deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The integration of self-supervised quantized representation is novel and could inspire further research on efficient knowledge integration methods. 2. **Efficient Token Usage:** The framework’s ability to maintain performance while significantly reducing the number of tokens is a marked strength that addresses practical limitations in deploying LLMs. 3. **Robust Empirical Validation:** The empirical results support the proposed approach and suggest a well-thought-out experimental design. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising, their applicability across diverse KGs or more complex LLM tasks remains to be fully established. Further studies could assess broader applicability. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The implementation of the proposed methodology may not be straightforward, which could limit its adoption by practitioners who may prefer simpler methods. 3. **Potential Overfitting:** The reliance on self-supervised techniques may lead to overfitting to specific datasets; additional validation across multiple datasets will be crucial. Considering these points, the paper makes a significant contribution to the integration of KGs and LLMs, proposing a method that balances efficiency and effectiveness. However, the generalizability and complexity aspects highlight the need for further exploration and validation. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a positive assessment of the paper's innovative approach and potential impact on the field, tempered by concerns regarding broader applicability and implementation challenges. The foundational work laid down by this research could pave the way for deeper exploration and refinement in future studies.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18154v1)
- **Authors**: Wanlong Liu, Yichen Xiao, Dingyi Zeng, Hongyang Zhao, Wenyu Chen, Malu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for deploying large language models (LLMs) within resource-limited settings by significantly reducing resource demands. However, existing PTQ strategies underperform at low bit levels < 3 bits due to the significant difference between the quantized and original weights. To enhance the quantization performance at low bit widths, we introduce a Mixed-precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) approach, employing a graph neural network (GNN) module to capture dependencies among weights and adaptively assign quantization bit-widths. Through the information propagation of the GNN module, our method more effectively captures dependencies among target weights, leading to a more accurate assessment of weight importance and optimized allocation of quantization strategies. Extensive experiments on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets demonstrate that our MG-PTQ method outperforms previous state-of-the-art PTQ method GPTQ, setting new benchmarks for quantization performance under low-bit conditions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Mixed-Precision Graph Neural Quantization for Low Bit Large Language Models" addresses the significant challenges of deploying large language models (LLMs) under resource constraints through Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). The authors highlight that current PTQ methods struggle with low-bit quantization (< 3 bits) due to substantial discrepancies between quantized and original weights. To tackle this issue, they propose the Mixed-Precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) method, which employs a graph neural network (GNN) to model dependencies among weights and dynamically assign quantization bit-widths based on the importance of individual weights. Their experimental results on WikiText2 and C4 datasets show that MG-PTQ surpasses the previous state-of-the-art, GPTQ, thus establishing new benchmarks for quantization performance in low-bit environments. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The use of graph neural networks to optimize weight quantization is a noteworthy approach, adding a novel layer of complexity and potential effectiveness over traditional methods. By explicitly capturing dependencies among weights, the paper introduces an innovative strategy that could significantly enhance quantization accuracy at low bit-widths. This aspect does offer a fresh perspective in a field that is typically dominated by simpler linear approaches. However, it's important to note that while the idea of using GNNs is innovative in this context, graph-based methods have been previously explored in other aspects of machine learning, which slightly diminishes the novelty. **Significance:** The significance of enhancing quantization methods for LLMs cannot be overstated, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This work directly contributes to the field by providing a solution that allows large models to remain usable in practical applications without requiring extensive computational resources. Given the ongoing trend toward model efficiency and the increased interest in deploying LLMs on edge devices, the findings presented in this paper could have a substantial impact on the future of LLM deployment strategies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** Incorporating a GNN for quantization decisions provides a sophisticated mechanism for understanding weight interactions. 2. **Performance Gains:** The empirical results demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods, indicating that the proposed method is effective in practice. 3. **Relevance:** The work addresses a critical problem in machine learning, making it highly relevant to current research and application scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** The added complexity of using GNNs may pose challenges in terms of computational efficiency and might not be as straightforward to implement as simpler methods. 2. **Scalability:** While the results are promising, the scaling of MG-PTQ to even larger models or different architectures remains to be seen, potentially limiting its generalizability. 3. **Limited Comparison:** The paper focuses primarily on comparisons to GPTQ; a broader benchmarking against a wider range of quantization techniques could strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method. Given these considerations, this paper presents a meaningful advancement in the field of low-bit quantization techniques for large language models. The innovative use of GNNs represents a unique contribution, although it must be further validated across various scenarios to fully establish its utility and robustness. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution with notable novelty and significant implications for the field, balanced against some concerns regarding practicality and broader applicability.

### Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18158v1)
- **Authors**: Yuchen Lei, Yuexin Xiang, Qin Wang, Rafael Dowsley, Tsz Hon Yuen, Jiangshan Yu
- **Abstract**: Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Large Language Models for Cryptocurrency Transaction Analysis: A Bitcoin Case Study" explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze cryptocurrency transactions, particularly focusing on the Bitcoin network. The authors criticize existing transaction analysis methods for their lack of interpretability and adaptability, leading to the hypothesis that LLMs can effectively address these issues due to their capabilities in reasoning and handling complex tasks. They propose a three-tiered framework for evaluating LLMs—comprising foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. Additionally, the authors introduce two novel contributions: a graph representation format (LLM4TG) aimed at enhancing readability and comprehension, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm (CETraS) for simplifying larger transaction graphs. Experimental findings demonstrate that LLMs perform well on foundational metrics and provide insightful overviews and interpretations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance** The paper's novelty stems from its engagement with an emergent and critical area of research—cryptocurrency transaction analysis—using advanced LLMs. The authors successfully identify the limitations of current methodologies and propose LLMs as an alternative, which is an innovative approach. Their development of LLM4TG and CETraS contributes valuable tools to the field, enhancing interpretability and processing for transaction graph analyses. However, the degree of novelty might be tempered by the recognition that LLMs have been widely discussed in various domains including natural language processing and, to some extent, data analytics related to cryptocurrencies. Thus, while the application of LLMs is commendable, it may not represent a wholly unprecedented concept within the broader landscape of machine learning research. **Strengths** 1. **Relevance**: The paper addresses a significant gap in cryptocurrency transaction analysis, offering a contemporary solution.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18160v1)
- **Authors**: Jinyao Guo, Chengpeng Wang, Xiangzhe Xu, Zian Su, Xiangyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code auditing is a code review process with the goal of finding bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial potential in this task, offering the ability to analyze programs without compilation and enabling customized bug detection following specified prompts. However, applying LLMs to repository-level code auditing presents notable challenges. The inherent context limits and hallucinations of LLMs can lead to the low quality of bug reports. Meanwhile, the large size of software repositories introduces substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios. This work introduces an autonomous LLM-agent, RepoAudit, designed to enable precise and efficient repository-level code auditing. Equipped with the agent memory, RepoAudit explores the code repository on demand, analyzing data-flow facts along different feasible program paths in individual functions. It also introduces the validator to check the data-flow facts for hallucination mitigation and examine the satisfiability of path conditions of potential buggy paths, which enables RepoAudit to discard false positives in the code auditing. Our experiment shows that RepoAudit powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet successfully finds 38 true bugs in 15 real-world systems, consuming 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project on average.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents RepoAudit, an autonomous LLM (Large Language Model) agent designed for repository-level code auditing to enhance bug detection capabilities in large software repositories. The authors recognize the limitations of LLMs, including context limits and hallucinations, which can compromise the quality of bug reports. RepoAudit addresses these challenges through a memory mechanism that allows it to explore code repositories dynamically and analyze data-flow facts across various program paths within individual functions. A validation component helps mitigate hallucinations and assess the accuracy of path conditions associated with potential bugs, thereby reducing false positives. The experimental results indicate that RepoAudit effectively identifies real bugs, averaging 38 true bugs found in 15 distinct systems with minimal time and financial expenditure. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of RepoAudit lies in its approach to mitigate the limitations faced by existing LLMs when applied to the complex task of repository-level code auditing. By integrating an agent memory for systematic exploration and a validator for accuracy checks, the authors build upon the existing research in LLM applications to not only improve the efficiency of bug detection but also the reliability of results. This combination enhances the auditing process by addressing significant challenges in the field. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The method of employing an agent memory and validation process for auditing represents a significant advancement in applying LLMs to software engineering. 2. **Practical Relevance:** The results evidenced practical applications, as the model shows efficiency in processing, with a low time and cost per project. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental findings indicate real-world applicability by identifying actual bugs, which is critical for validation in software engineering practices. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependency on LLM Quality:** The effectiveness of RepoAudit is inherently tied to the performance of the underlying LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), meaning it may not generalize well across different LLMs. 2. **Scalability Concerns:** While the proposed method helps with efficiency, large-scale deployment in various environments may face challenges not addressed in the study, such as dealing with diverse coding styles and nuances in various programming languages. 3. **Evaluation Scope:** The evaluation is based on a limited number of projects; broader assessments may be needed to understand the model's capabilities comprehensively. **Potential Impact:** The contribution of this paper is significant as it proposes a viable solution to a longstanding problem in software quality assurance. If scalability can be achieved, this method could fundamentally change how developers approach code auditing, making it a more automated and reliable process. Given these considerations, I assign the paper a score of **8**. While it addresses key limitations of LLMs in code auditing and shows promising results, concerns about broad applicability and scalability suggest there are still areas for improvement and further research.  **Score: 8**

### Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18177v1)
- **Authors**: Teddy Lazebnik, Labib Shami
- **Abstract**: Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a persistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications. Many socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing factors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the tax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as observed in the real world, neglecting the "big bang" of such activity in a population. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in computer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy appearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel computational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the emergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation powered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework is uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge organically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling agents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for exploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The experimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases, demonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic behaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal economic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is sufficient to curtail informal activity effectively.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation" addresses the longstanding issue of tax evasion, a significant aspect of informal economies. It critiques existing socio-economic studies that examine tax evasion by assuming such behaviors are predefined and instead develops a novel computational framework that allows tax evasion behaviors to emerge naturally through agent-based simulations. This framework integrates Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning to explore how various factors—including individual personality traits, public goods efficiency, external narratives, and enforcement probabilities—affect tax evasion behavior over time. The findings reveal that both efficient public goods provision and strong enforcement are crucial in mitigating informal economic activity, challenging the notion that either strategy can stand alone effectively. ### Rigorous Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**   This study's most notable contribution lies in its innovative use of AI techniques—specifically, Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning—to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge rather than be imposed. This exploration represents a significant shift from traditional models that predominantly rely on fixed behavioral assumptions. The synthesis of AI with economic modeling is timely and relevant, given the growing interest in advanced computational simulations in social sciences. **Significance:**   The findings illustrate how multifaceted determinants, including psychological and socio-economic variables, impact tax evasion. This multidimensional understanding could provide policymakers with deeper insights into designing effective tax policies and enforcement strategies. Additionally, the emphasis on public goods provision as a complementary factor to enforcement mechanisms has implications for economic policy, framing the debate around taxation and public trust in governments. **Strengths:**   1. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of cutting-edge AI techniques to model human behaviors in economic contexts is a significant advancement. 2. **Robust Experimental Design:** The paper includes valid experimental phases that enhance the credibility of the findings and the proposed framework. 3. **Policy Relevance:** The results have practical implications for the design of tax policy, especially regarding the interaction between enforcement and public goods efficiency. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Assumptions about Personality Traits:** The reliance on personality traits as significant determinants may limit broader applicability; these traits can vary culturally and contextually. 2. **Complexity vs. Interpretability:** The integration of complex AI models may complicate the transparency of decision-making processes in simulations, raising questions about the interpretability of results. 3. **Limited Real-world Inflections:** While the simulation captures emergent behaviors, it may not fully replicate real-world complexities, including economic shocks and changing social norms. ### Conclusion While the study significantly advances the understanding of tax evasion dynamics through a sophisticated methodological lens, its assumptions and potential overfitting to theoretical constructs may limit its applicability across different socio-economic contexts. Overall, the paper represents a meaningful contribution to the fields of tax policy and computational economics, particularly in integrating AI tools into simulations. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's strong novelty and significance, balanced by some concerns regarding the general applicability of its findings and the clarity of its analytical framework. The integration of advanced technology into socio-economic modeling is commendable, but it needs to be contextualized to maximize impact in real-world applications.

### In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18187v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyuan Sun, Ali Jadbabaie, Navid Azizan
- **Abstract**: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable ability in in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a prompt with a few examples, without requiring parameter updates. Recent research has provided insight into how linear Transformers can perform ICL by implementing gradient descent estimators. In particular, it has been shown that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent with respect to a linear least-squares objective when trained on random linear regression tasks. However, the theoretical understanding of ICL for nonlinear function classes remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by first showing that LSA is inherently restricted to solving linear least-squares objectives and thus, the solutions in prior works cannot readily extend to nonlinear ICL tasks. To overcome this limitation, drawing inspiration from modern architectures, we study a mechanism that combines LSA with GLU-like feed-forward layers and show that this allows the model to perform one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression. Further, we characterize the scaling behavior of the resulting Transformer model, highlighting the necessary model size to effectively handle quadratic ICL tasks. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of attention and feed-forward layers in nonlinear ICL and identify key challenges when extending ICL to nonlinear function classes.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the limitations of linear self-attention (LSA) in transformer models regarding in-context learning (ICL) for nonlinear functions, specifically polynomial kernel regression. Previous findings showcased LSA's effectiveness for linear tasks but did not extend to nonlinear scenarios. To address this gap, the authors propose integrating LSA with feed-forward layers inspired by Gated Linear Units (GLU), enabling the model to perform a single gradient descent step on polynomial tasks. The paper also characterizes the model's scaling behavior needed for handling quadratic ICL tasks and emphasizes the distinct contributions of attention and feed-forward layers in nonlinear contexts. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The paper presents a significant and timely exploration of ICL mechanisms in transformer architectures, specifically targeting nonlinear tasks, which have been underrepresented in existing literature. By combining LSA with GLU-like layers, it introduces a novel approach that enhances the model’s capabilities beyond linear regression, filling an important theoretical gap. This advancement represents an original contribution to the understanding of transformer models and their applicability to more complex learning scenarios. **Significance:** The implications of this work are substantial as they address a critical limitation of previous models, potentially broadening the applicability of transformers in real-world scenarios where nonlinear relationships exist. By detailing the necessary scaling for effective performance on polynomial tasks, the paper also provides practical guidance for future model developments. **Strengths:** - Theoretical expansion on ICL, moving beyond linear frameworks. - Practical relevance with potential real-world applications. - The combination of established approaches (LSA and GLU) provides a clear innovation pathway. **Weaknesses:** - The paper may lack extensive experimental validation to support the proposed theoretical insights. Greater empirical evidence could enhance the credibility of claims made about model performance. - The complexity of results related to scaling might pose implementation challenges that are not addressed sufficiently, which could limit accessibility for researchers without a strong theoretical background. **Influence on the Field:** While the theoretical framework laid down in this paper can inspire future research, the dependence on robust validation and practical implementations will determine its lasting impact. If followed by strong empirical support, this work could pave the way for new architectures capable of addressing more complex tasks within the broader context of ICL. Given these considerations, I assign this paper a **Score: 7**. The score reflects its novelty and potential impact, albeit tempered by the need for more robust experimental validation and the complexities of implementation. This score acknowledges the paper's contribution while also highlighting areas for improvement.

### Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v1)
- **Authors**: James Blades, Frederick Somerfield, William Langley, Susan Everingham, Maurice Witherington
- **Abstract**: Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses a novel approach to token representation in large-scale neural architectures, specifically focusing on the limitations of traditional methods that do not explicitly encode structured relationships among tokens. While existing self-attention mechanisms model contextual dependencies dynamically, they often fail to maintain long-range hierarchical structures. The authors propose a dependency-aware token encoding method that enhances the initialization of embeddings and incorporates relational constraints into token representations. This leads to improved contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation, demonstrated through reductions in perplexity on various linguistic benchmarks. The encoding method employs dependency-weighted attention and shows notable improvements in dependency alignment, especially in longer sequences. Though the method incurs moderate increases in memory consumption and training time, it remains compatible with typical transformer architectures. The findings suggest that structured encoding can enhance lexical variation and mitigate abrupt phrase transitions, ultimately supporting the premise that explicit dependency encoding produces more coherent phrasing without relying on external syntactic annotations. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its proposed mechanism for integrating structured relationships into token embeddings, a significant advancement over traditional self-attention models. By addressing a well-known gap in preserving long-range hierarchical structures during the token interaction process, the work presents a practical solution, particularly beneficial for generating coherent text over extended sequences. Its empirical evaluations and comparisons lend credible support to its claims, which is a strong feature of the paper. However, the paper has several weaknesses. Firstly, while it benchmarks against several linguistic tasks, the limited description of the datasets and specific details on the experimental setup may prevent full assessment of the method's robustness. The moderate increase in resource consumption raises concerns about scalability, especially in resource-constrained environments. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the theoretical implications of the dependency-aware encoding method in detail, which could provide deeper insights into how it compares with emerging approaches like those utilizing graphs or other structured representation methods. Overall, the contribution is significant enough to influence ongoing research into structured token interactions within language models, especially as the quest for efficient and coherent long-text generation continues in the field of natural language processing. **Score: 7**  This score reflects both the innovative aspects of the proposed method and the substantiated benefits it offers while also considering the limitations in experimental transparency and potential scalability issues. The impact is likely positive, but further validation through varied datasets and exploration of theoretical implications would strengthen its position in the field.

- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Li, Chunlong Sun, Xiangcheng Zheng
- **Abstract**: This work investigates both direct and inverse problems of the variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which attracts increasing attentions in both practical applications and theoretical aspects. Based on the perturbation method, which transfers the original model to an equivalent but more tractable form, the analytical extensibility of the solutions and the weak unique continuation principle are proved, which results in the uniqueness of the inverse space-dependent source problem from local internal observation. Then, based on the variational identity connecting the inversion input data with the unknown source function, we propose a weak norm and prove the conditional stability for the inverse problem in this norm. The iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are employed to numerically reconstruct the smooth and non-smooth sources, respectively. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate their effectiveness.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the inverse source problem related to a variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which is gaining traction for its applications and theoretical implications. Using a perturbation method, the study reformulates the original model to enhance solution tractability. It establishes the uniqueness of the inverse space-dependent source problem through analytical proofs of solutions' extensibility and the weak unique continuation principle. Additionally, the authors present a variational identity linking inversion input data with the source function, introducing a weak norm that ensures conditional stability for the inverse problem. The paper employs an iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov's iteration scheme to reconstruct both smooth and non-smooth sources. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents several novel contributions within the realm of inverse problems and sub-diffusion processes. Its innovative use of a perturbation method not only simplifies the original model but also solidifies the theoretical foundations of uniqueness in the inverse problems — which is crucial in applied mathematics and its applications in fields like physics and engineering. Furthermore, the introduction of conditional stability linked to a weak norm marks an advancement in understanding the sensitivity of inverse problems, which is a significant aspect of this research area. Strengths include: - Theoretical advancements in tackling the uniqueness of solutions for inverse problems, which is pivotal in ensuring reliable models. - A clear application of perturbation methods, enhancing the tractability of complex models. - Effective numerical algorithms that address both smooth and non-smooth sources, demonstrating practical applicability. - Sound numerical validation of methods provides confidence in the results obtained. Weaknesses involve: - Lack of extensive comparison with existing methodologies, which could highlight the relative advantages of the proposed techniques. - Potential limitations in terms of the types of applications or systems for which this model is applicable, not thoroughly discussed. - The reliance on specific numerical methods may limit adaptability to different problem scenarios in practice. Overall, the paper contributes to the understanding of inverse problems in sub-diffusion but could benefit from more comprehensive benchmarking against existing literature. The balance of theoretical depth and practical application gives it a solid foundation, warranting a favorable appraisal. **Score: 8**  This score reflects its considerable contributions to the field, strong theoretical grounding, and application potential while noting areas for further exploration and comparison with established methods.

### ExeCoder: Empowering Large Language Models with Executability Representation for Code Translation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18460v1)
- **Authors**: Minghua He, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Wenjie Yin, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code translation is a crucial activity in the software development and maintenance process, and researchers have recently begun to focus on using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for code translation. However, existing LLMs only learn the contextual semantics of code during pre-training, neglecting executability information closely related to the execution state of the code, which results in unguaranteed code executability and unreliable automated code translation. To address this issue, we propose ExeCoder, an LLM specifically designed for code translation, aimed at utilizing executability representations such as functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in code translation. To evaluate the effectiveness of ExeCoder, we manually enhanced the widely used benchmark TransCoder-test, resulting in a benchmark called TransCoder-test-X that serves LLMs. Evaluation of TransCoder-test-X indicates that ExeCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in code translation, surpassing existing open-source code LLMs by over 10.88% to 38.78% and over 27.44% to 42.97% on two metrics, and even outperforms the renowned closed-source LLM GPT-4o. Website: https://execoder4trans.github.io/
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces ExeCoder, an advanced large language model (LLM) specifically tailored for code translation tasks. The authors identify a significant limitation of existing LLMs, which primarily focus on contextual semantics but fail to account for executability information—crucial for ensuring the translated code can actually run and function correctly. ExeCoder seeks to bridge this gap by integrating executability representations that encompass functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies, thereby improving the reliability and accuracy of code translation. The authors conducted evaluations using a new benchmark, TransCoder-test-X, that they developed by enhancing the existing TransCoder-test. The results demonstrate that ExeCoder significantly outperforms both open-source LLMs and the well-known closed-source LLM, GPT-4o, in code translation metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:**  ExeCoder addresses a critical gap in the existing methodology for code translation using LLMs by incorporating executability representations. This focus on executability is novel, considering that many current models neglect this aspect, which leads to issues in the translated code's reliability and functionality. By proposing a model that emphasizes this, the authors contribute a potentially transformative approach to the field of automated code translation. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of executability representations represents a significant shift in how code translation can be approached, potentially leading to more reliable outcomes. 2. **Empirical Evaluation:** The development of the new TransCoder-test-X benchmark and its subsequent results lend strong empirical support to the claims of improved performance, showcasing thorough experimental work. 3. **Practical Relevance:** Given the rising complexity of software development, a model that improves code translation reliability is timely and of high relevance for industry and research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the focus on executability is an important enhancement, the paper could benefit from discussing how ExeCoder handles edge cases or error-prone code patterns in greater detail. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although ExeCoder outperforms existing models, understanding the boundaries of its effectiveness compared to potential future models would help frame its significance better. Exploring how performance improvements might taper off with increasingly complex code could add depth to the results. 3. **Generalizability:** The paper does not provide information on whether the model is generalizable across different programming languages or specific domains, which could limit its applicability. **Overall Assessment:** The paper marks important progress in the field of automated code translation by addressing an often-overlooked aspect of executability. The constructive critique of existing methodologies and the proposed enhancements make ExeCoder a notable contribution. However, the scope of evaluation and practical implications could be further explored. Thus, while ExeCoder shows great promise, further investigations into its limitations and broader applicability are necessary. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's solid contribution to the field, innovative approach, and potential for practical impact, while also acknowledging the need for further detailed exploration of the model's limitations and applicability across varying code complexities.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18475v1)
- **Authors**: Yanxia Deng, Aozhong Zhang, Naigang Wang, Selcuk Gurses, Zi Yang, Penghang Yin
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a novel initialization method aimed at enhancing the fine-tuning of quantized large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). The primary challenge addressed is the reduced precision of quantized weights, which complicates the application of LoRA in this context. CLoQ minimizes discrepancies between original and quantized LLMs during initialization, using a calibration dataset to determine optimal LoRA parameters for each layer. A theoretical framework is offered for constructing these parameters, demonstrating that CLoQ outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods in tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, particularly at low-bit widths. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of CLoQ lies in its specialized approach to quantized LLMs, where existing LoRA methods have struggled due to the inherent limitations in representational capacity. The theoretical results that underpin CLoQ's initialization strategy provide a valuable contribution to the understanding of initialization challenges in quantized neural networks.  Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Approach**: By focusing on the layer-wise discrepancy between original and quantized models, CLoQ addresses a gap in the existing literature regarding fine-tuning quantized LLMs. 2. **Theoretical Contribution**: The introduction of a framework for constructing optimal LoRA components enriches methodological approaches in the field. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper reports performance improvements across various tasks, substantiating the proposed method with empirical evidence. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Scope of Impact**: While the results show improved performance, it remains to be seen whether these improvements are robust across a wider range of tasks or more diverse models, which the paper might not fully explore. 2. **Practical Applicability**: The requirement for a calibration dataset could limit feasibility in resource-constrained environments, which may reduce the paper's accessibility for practitioners aiming to deploy quantized LLMs in real-world applications. 3. **Breadth of Evaluation**: The paper could benefit from a comparison to more advanced fine-tuning techniques, beyond just existing LoRA methods, to fully contextualize its contributions. Overall, while CLoQ offers valuable advancements in the fine-tuning of quantized LLMs and addresses significant limitations in the current methodologies, its broader applicability and impact within the field may be constricted by certain caveats. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects the paper’s solid contributions, but also recognizes the limitations that may hinder its influence on future research and application within the broader AI and machine learning community. **Score: 7**

### A Tool for In-depth Analysis of Code Execution Reasoning of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18482v1)
- **Authors**: Changshu Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand
- **Abstract**: Code Executing Reasoning is becoming a new non-functional metric that assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) in programming tasks. State-of-the-art frameworks (CodeMind or REval) and benchmarks (CruxEval) usually focus on LLM's prediction of a given code's input/output or intermediate variable states/values on limited programs. However, there is no tool for more in-depth analysis of the results. Without such a tool, the observations about LLM's code execution reasoning cannot be generalized to more datasets, preventing the research community and practitioners from devising the next generation of LLMs with better code execution reasoning abilities. This paper introduces ExeRScope, a series of tools and heuristics to analyze the result of code execution reasoning frameworks to understand better the impact of code properties in the studied benchmarks on the code execution reasoning. With such tooling, analysis can be generalized to code with similar properties without the urgent need to design more benchmarks, which is a cumbersome effort.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces ExeRScope, a novel toolset designed to enhance the analysis of code execution reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Recognizing that current benchmarks and frameworks like CodeMind, REval, and CruxEval have limitations—primarily focusing on predicting code output or variable states on restricted datasets—the authors assert that there is a gap in tools for deeper analysis. ExeRScope addresses this by providing heuristics that allow researchers to understand how various properties of code affect execution reasoning results. This approach not only aids in analysis but also enables the generalization of findings across similar code properties, alleviating the need for new benchmarks, which can be resource-intensive to develop. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The introduction of ExeRScope addresses a clear gap in the existing methodologies related to LLMs and their reasoning capabilities in coding tasks. Given the rising importance of LLMs in software development and programming education, the paper's focus on a robust analysis tool is timely and relevant. However, while the idea of providing generalizable analysis tools is not entirely novel, the specific context of LLMs and the attention to code execution reasoning is relatively underexplored. **Significance**: The significance of this work lies in its potential to advance the understanding of LLMs in practical programming scenarios. By enabling deeper analysis, the tool could help identify specific aspects of code that LLMs struggle with, which can guide future model development and the creation of more relevant benchmarks. The implications are substantial for both the research community and practitioners looking to leverage LLMs in real-world applications. **Strengths**: - ExeRScope’s ability to generalize findings may reduce the overhead of creating new benchmarks, which is a clear strength. - The focus on code execution reasoning highlights a crucial aspect of code generation that is often overlooked. - The paper addresses a growing concern regarding the evaluative metrics of AI models in programming, providing a more nuanced perspective. **Weaknesses**: - The novelty could be seen as somewhat bounded since the need for analysis tools has been recognized in other AI domains, and similar concepts have been applied in other areas without a direct implementation discussed in the paper. - The practical implementation and user accessibility of ExeRScope may not be elaborated sufficiently, which could limit its immediate application or adoption in the community. - The scope of how the heuristics will be evaluated or integrated with existing frameworks remains vague. ### Conclusion While ExeRScope represents a noteworthy advancement in the tools available for analyzing code execution reasoning in LLMs, its overall novelty might be diminished by the existence of similar concepts in other domains. Nevertheless, the paper has significant implications for future research and practical applications within the field of LLMs and programming.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution with notable strengths, although tempered by certain limitations in novelty and depth regarding practical application.

### Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18512v1)
- **Authors**: Arthur Douillard, Yanislav Donchev, Keith Rush, Satyen Kale, Zachary Charles, Zachary Garrett, Gabriel Teston, Dave Lacey, Ross McIlroy, Jiajun Shen, Alexandre Ramé, Arthur Szlam, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Paul Barham
- **Abstract**: Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch" addresses the challenge of training large language models (LLMs) efficiently across distributed systems. Traditional methods require co-located accelerators with high-bandwidth connections to facilitate frequent exchanges of internal states and gradients, which is a significant bottleneck in training time. The authors propose enhancements to the DiLoCo algorithm that allows for looser synchronization requirements among workers. Their key contributions include: 1) synchronizing only subsets of parameters instead of all at once, which drastically lowers peak bandwidth usage, 2) allowing workers to continue training while synchronizing, which reduces total training time, and 3) quantizing the data exchanged to further minimize bandwidth consumption. Through empirical results, they demonstrate that these improvements facilitate the training of models with billions of parameters while maintaining learning quality and achieving a substantial decrease in bandwidth requirements by two orders of magnitude. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper presents a novel approach to overcoming the constraints associated with the DiLoCo distributed training method. The combination of sequential parameter synchronization, overlapping communication, and data quantization represents a significant step forward in making distributed training more feasible in practical settings. By allowing workers to train while synchronizing, the authors tackle a key inefficiency present in past methods and offer a more scalable solution. However, it is worth noting that while the individual components (parameter subset synchronization, overlapping communication) have been explored in previous research, their integration in the specific context of the DiLoCo framework is a fresh contribution. #### Significance The significance of this work lies in its potential impact on large-scale machine learning practices. The ability to train large models with reduced bandwidth alongside maintaining model quality could democratize access to state-of-the-art language models, making it easier for organizations with limited resources to engage in cutting-edge research. Moreover, the approach aligns with current trends in machine learning that are seeking to optimize resource usage and efficiency, making the findings highly relevant to practitioners in the field. #### Strengths - The empirical results demonstrate substantial improvements in bandwidth usage while maintaining model performance, showcasing the practical applicability of the proposed methods. - The paper addresses a timely and crucial problem in the machine learning community, particularly given the increasing scale and resource requirements of LLMs. - The authors provide clear explanations and justifications for their modifications to DiLoCo, making it easy for other researchers to understand and potentially replicate their methods. #### Weaknesses - While the paper claims significant improvements in bandwidth efficiency, the specific scenarios and models used for experiments may limit the generalizability of the results. More diverse testing across different types of LLMs would strengthen the validity of the findings. - The paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis of the implications of the proposed changes on convergence rates and learning dynamics, which are crucial for understanding the broader impact on learning efficiency. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the distributed training landscape for large language models by presenting an innovative methodology that addresses bandwidth constraints effectively. The combination of various improvements positions it well within the ongoing discussions about efficient machine learning practices. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Guanqun Cao, Ryan Mckenna, John Oyekan
- **Abstract**: Object rearrangement is a significant task for collaborative robots, where they are directed to manipulate objects into a specified goal state. Determining the placement of objects is a major challenge that influences the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position and are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and effectiveness.In this paper, we propose a framework of language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Particularly, our approach mimics human reasoning by using past successful experiences as a reference to infer the desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method can generalise to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequential orders.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework for language-conditioned object rearrangement utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the performance of collaborative robots. Traditional methods are limited by their reliance on specific datasets and predefined instructions, which can hinder their adaptability in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach draws on past successful experiences to deduce optimal object placements, leveraging LLMs' advanced natural language understanding and reasoning capabilities. this allows for effective handling of diverse instructions in a zero-shot context. Experimental evaluations indicate that the model performs well in executing robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving lengthy sequences. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty**: The paper introduces an innovative method that integrates LLMs into the field of object rearrangement, which is a significant deviation from conventional techniques that rely primarily on narrow datasets and rigid instructions. This intersection of natural language processing and robotics is relatively new, thus promising enhanced generalization and flexibility. **Strengths**: 1. **Generalization**: The applicability of the proposed method to varied instructions and types of objects is a key strength, potentially broadening the operational capability of collaborative robots in uncontrolled environments. 2. **Human-like Reasoning**: By mimicking human reasoning through referencing past experiences, the method introduces a more intuitive approach to object manipulation, which could lead to improved interaction between robots and humans. 3. **Experimental Validation**: Providing experimental results that illustrate the model's efficacy in real-world scenarios strengthens the validity of the claims made. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Dependence on Past Data**: While the reliance on past successful experiences is an innovative aspect, the paper does not extensively discuss the potential limitations regarding the nature and quantity of the past data used for training, which could impact performance. 2. **Scalability and Complexity**: The complexity of the proposed framework may affect its scalability in real-world applications, depending on how the LLM is integrated with robotic systems and the computational resources required. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the performance metrics used to evaluate the results, which could raise questions about the robustness and replicability of the findings. **Conclusion**: Overall, while the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of robotic manipulation by leveraging LLMs for language-conditioned tasks, some concerns regarding scalability, data dependency, and evaluation merit consideration. The framework appears promising but will require further work to address its limitations and cement its practical applicability. **Score**: 7

### Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18532v1)
- **Authors**: Anmol Goel, Yaxi Hu, Iryna Gurevych, Amartya Sanyal
- **Abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the \textit{\underline{P}rivate \underline{S}teering for LLM \underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation editing and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated probabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our \textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA) algorithm aimed at aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values without risking the leakage of private data. It focuses on a novel approach to activation editing, which helps train models by using both positive and negative demonstrations while ensuring differential privacy (DP). Through extensive testing on a variety of open-source LLMs, the authors demonstrate that PSA maintains DP guarantees with minimal performance trade-offs in alignment, text quality, and reasoning tasks. Furthermore, they introduce a Membership Inference Attack (MIA) specifically for this context, enabling privacy auditing of LLM activations based on generated outputs. The results suggest that PSA offers improved empirical privacy compared to existing non-private alignment techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions to the field of machine learning and large language models, particularly in the context of privacy-preserving techniques. The focus on aligning LLMs while managing privacy concerns is a significant step forward, as the trade-off between performance and privacy is a growing concern in AI applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The introduction of the PSA algorithm, which applies differential privacy guarantees to activation editing for LLMs, is an innovative approach that has not been extensively covered in existing literature. 2. **Relevance**: The work addresses a critical area in AI where the safe application of models is paramount, especially as LLMs are increasingly deployed in sensitive contexts. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The use of extensive benchmarks and the deployment of a Membership Inference Attack (MIA) tailored for this scenario provide robust evidence supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the results are promising, the paper only tests on a selection of open-source LLMs. The findings may not readily generalize to proprietary or more complex models that utilize different architectures or training datasets. 2. **Privacy Metrics**: The reliance on MIA raises questions about the robustness of differential privacy assurances in diverse operational environments. The complexity of language generation might introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities. 3. **Performance Trade-offs**: Although the authors claim minimal performance loss, clearer quantification of this trade-off across different tasks would strengthen the arguments. The metrics used to measure alignment and reasoning quality could be further discussed to validate the claim comprehensively. **Potential Influence:** The implications of the PSA algorithm are significant, offering a foundation for future research in both alignment methods and privacy preservation. As demands for ethical AI grow, contributions like this may help set standards for responsible AI deployment. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper’s strong innovation and relevance, coupled with a solid empirical foundation. However, it acknowledges the potential limitations in generizability and the need for further exploration of performance impacts and privacy assurances. The work is a commendable addition to the literature and could pave the way for more extensive research in this intersection of machine learning, alignment, and privacy concerns.

### Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18533v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Ding, Lijun Li, Bing Cao, Jing Shao
- **Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin. Data and Models are released under: \href{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}{\texttt{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}}
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models" discusses the limitations of current safety fine-tuning methods for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-critical applications. It identifies a "safety reasoning gap," where existing methods do not adequately incorporate visual reasoning capabilities necessary for safety assurance. To address this issue, the authors introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, which includes multi-image inputs paired with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning labels to facilitate training. Through experiments, they demonstrate that fine-tuning the InternVL2.5-8B model with the MIS dataset significantly enhances performance on safety-related multi-image tasks, achieving better accuracy while simultaneously reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR). The results indicate no compromises on general capabilities. The dataset and models are made publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a timely and relevant issue in the deployment of VLMs in safety-critical domains. The introduction of the MIS dataset is a major strength, as it fills a significant gap identified in previous works. The approach of integrating Chain-of-Thought reasoning with multi-image datasets appears innovative, addressing the shortcomings of existing safety fine-tuning methods primarily focused on textual data. The paper's experimental results further corroborate the efficacy of the MIS dataset, showing measurable improvements in model performance. However, while the proposed dataset and methodology are valuable, there are several areas of concern. Firstly, the theoretical foundation for why multi-image safety scenarios specifically require different approaches than single-image or text-centered tasks could be more thoroughly explored. Further, although the results show improved accuracy and reduced ASR, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide additional qualitative insights or case studies demonstrating the model's performance in real-world safety-critical settings. Lastly, the paper does not sufficiently address the scalability of the proposed fine-tuning approach to broader applications beyond the tested scenarios, which could hinder its generalizability. Overall, this work makes a solid contribution to improving safety in VLMs, particularly in multi-image contexts. While it does face challenges in depth and scalability, its focus on integrating visual reasoning into safety frameworks marks a significant step forward in the field. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's inventive introduction of the MIS dataset and the considerable improvement in safety-related visual reasoning it showcases. However, its limitations in theoretical depth and practical applicability slightly diminish its impact, preventing a higher score.

- **Abstract**: A clear understanding of where humans move in a scenario, their usual paths and speeds, and where they stop, is very important for different applications, such as mobility studies in urban areas or robot navigation tasks within human-populated environments. We propose in this article, a neural architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) to provide this information. This solution can arguably capture spatial correlations more effectively than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the paper, we describe the methodology and proposed neural architecture and show the experiments' results with a standard dataset. We show that the proposed ViT architecture improves the metrics compared to a method based on a CNN.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Learning Priors of Human Motion With Vision Transformers" proposes a novel neural architecture that utilizes Vision Transformers (ViTs) to model human movement patterns in various scenarios. The proposed method focuses on predicting aspects such as typical paths, speeds, and stopping locations of individuals, which is essential for applications in urban mobility studies and robotic navigation. The authors argue that ViTs can capture spatial correlations more effectively than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). They present a detailed description of their methodology and architecture, alongside experimental results using a standard dataset, demonstrating that their ViT-based solution outperforms traditional CNN methods in relevant performance metrics. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The application of Vision Transformers to human motion forecasting presents a noteworthy innovation, as it explores an alternative to the widely used CNNs in this domain.

### BounTCHA: A CAPTCHA Utilizing Boundary Identification in AI-extended Videos
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18565v1)
- **Authors**: Lehao Lin, Ke Wang, Maha Abdallah, Wei Cai
- **Abstract**: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) especially multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has enabled it to understand text, images, videos, and other multimedia data, allowing AI systems to execute various tasks based on human-provided prompts. However, AI-powered bots have increasingly been able to bypass most existing CAPTCHA systems, posing significant security threats to web applications. This makes the design of new CAPTCHA mechanisms an urgent priority. We observe that humans are highly sensitive to shifts and abrupt changes in videos, while current AI systems still struggle to comprehend and respond to such situations effectively. Based on this observation, we design and implement BounTCHA, a CAPTCHA mechanism that leverages human perception of boundaries in video transitions and disruptions. By utilizing AI's capability to expand original videos with prompts, we introduce unexpected twists and changes to create a pipeline for generating short videos for CAPTCHA purposes. We develop a prototype and conduct experiments to collect data on humans' time biases in boundary identification. This data serves as a basis for distinguishing between human users and bots. Additionally, we perform a detailed security analysis of BounTCHA, demonstrating its resilience against various types of attacks. We hope that BounTCHA will act as a robust defense, safeguarding millions of web applications in the AI-driven era.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents BounTCHA, a novel CAPTCHA mechanism designed to counteract the threat posed by AI-powered bots that have increasingly been successful in bypassing traditional CAPTCHA systems. The proposed system leverages human sensitivity to abrupt changes in videos, specifically focusing on boundary identification in video transitions. By taking advantage of multi-modal Large Language Models' (MLLMs) capability to generate videos with unexpected twists, BounTCHA creates short video clips that require human users to identify perceptual boundaries. The authors conducted experiments to gather data on human responses to these video transitions, forming the basis for differentiating between human and bot interactions. A security analysis of BounTCHA is also provided, showcasing its robustness against various attacks. The authors advocate for BounTCHA as a significant improvement in CAPTCHA technology amid the increasing capabilities of AI. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Original Concept**: The use of boundary identification in videos as a basis for CAPTCHA is an innovative idea. Many existing CAPTCHA systems rely on text or static images, making this approach a fresh perspective in the field. The integration of AI to dynamically generate video content tailored to enhance security adds another layer of novelty. 2. **Human-AI Distinction**: The emphasis on human perceptual capabilities versus AI's limitations in video comprehension marks a crucial contribution to the ongoing discourse on developing effective anti-bot mechanisms. By constructing a CAPTCHA that reflects the inherent differences in human versus AI processing, the paper addresses a vital need as traditional CAPTCHAs become less effective. 3. **Experimental Data**: The systematic experiments conducted to analyze human time biases in boundary identification provide empirical backing to the proposed mechanism. This strengthens the paper's credibility and offers a solid foundation for future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability and User Experience**: While the concept is intriguing, the practicality and user experience of video-based CAPTCHAs in widespread applications require more exploration. Users may find video CAPTCHAs more cumbersome or time-consuming compared to traditional methods, potentially leading to decreased usability. 2. **Thresholds for Bot Detection**: The paper does not delineate the thresholds or specific criteria used to distinguish between human and bot responses. A clearer definition of these parameters would support the argument for its effectiveness and could help in understanding potential edge cases where bots may still succeed. 3. **Security Analysis**: Although the paper claims resilience against various attacks, a detailed examination of potential vulnerabilities or limitations of the BounTCHA mechanism against sophisticated bots is necessary. The dynamic nature of AI bot development suggests that without a robust analysis, the longevity of this solution may be questionable. **Potential Influence**: If successfully implemented and refined, BounTCHA has the potential to revolutionize CAPTCHA design by providing robust protection against a diverse range of automated threats. Its influence could extend beyond traditional web applications into broader domains such as online voting, secure transactions, and personal data protection. **Score Justification**: Considering the originality of the idea, the empirical analysis, and the potential impact on CAPTCHA effectiveness, while also acknowledging its limitations regarding usability and full security assurance, I would assign a score of **7**.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18576v1)
- **Authors**: Evgenii Evstafev
- **Abstract**: This study investigates the performance of the DeepSeek R1 language model on 30 challenging mathematical problems derived from the MATH dataset, problems that previously proved unsolvable by other models under time constraints. Unlike prior work, this research removes time limitations to explore whether DeepSeek R1's architecture, known for its reliance on token-based reasoning, can achieve accurate solutions through a multi-step process. The study compares DeepSeek R1 with four other models (gemini-1.5-flash-8b, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, llama3.1:8b, and mistral-8b-latest) across 11 temperature settings. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves superior accuracy on these complex problems but generates significantly more tokens than other models, confirming its token-intensive approach. The findings highlight a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving with large language models: while DeepSeek R1 excels in accuracy, its reliance on extensive token generation may not be optimal for applications requiring rapid responses. The study underscores the importance of considering task-specific requirements when selecting an LLM and emphasizes the role of temperature settings in optimizing performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Token-Hungry, Yet Precise: DeepSeek R1 Highlights the Need for Multi-Step Reasoning Over Speed in MATH" investigates the capabilities of the DeepSeek R1 language model in solving complex mathematical problems from the MATH dataset. Unlike previous studies constrained by time limits, this research removes these constraints to determine if the architecturally unique, token-driven reasoning of DeepSeek R1 can yield accurate solutions via multi-step reasoning. The evaluation includes a comparison of DeepSeek R1 against four other language models under various temperature settings, revealing that while DeepSeek R1 displays superior accuracy, it also consumes significantly more tokens than its competitors. This showcases a critical trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving using large language models. The findings emphasize the importance of considering task-specific requirements, as well as the influence of temperature settings on model performance. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Focus on Multi-Step Reasoning:** The paper addresses a critical aspect of language model performance—multi-step reasoning—which is often overlooked in favor of speed in other studies. This focus contributes to evolving methodologies in mathematical AI problem-solving. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** The study not only assesses the DeepSeek R1 model in isolation but also compares it to several contemporaneous models, shedding light on its strengths and weaknesses. 3. **Token Generation Insight:** It thoroughly explores the implications of token generation, highlighting a often under-discussed aspect in the optimization of language models, which is crucial for understanding efficiency in practical applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Narrow Scope:** While the paper examines a specific set of mathematical problems and focuses on token consumption, it doesn't explore the broader implications for different categories of problems or real-world applications beyond the mathematical datasets. 2. **Limited Temperature Range:** The analysis of 11 temperature settings, while comprehensive, may not be sufficient to generalize findings across diverse problem types and sets. It raises questions about the robustness of the conclusions drawn regarding performance optimization. 3. **Error Acknowledgment:** The paper does not adequately address potential errors made by DeepSeek R1 despite its higher accuracy, nor does it explore the reasons for these errors which would inform future enhancements. **Impact on the Field:** The importance of the study lies in its exploration of the trade-off between accuracy and speed in mathematical problem-solving using language models. By emphasizing the need for multi-step reasoning, it contributes to the ongoing discourse on how language model architecture should be optimized for complex task performance. ### Conclusion Given the strengths in advancing our understanding of multi-step reasoning and token generation while highlighting crucial trade-offs, I find that the paper represents a valuable contribution to the field. However, its limitations in scope and depth of analysis suggest that while it opens up new avenues for research, it does not fully capitalize on the implications of its findings. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs" addresses the phenomenon of underthinking observed in large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on OpenAI's o1 model. The authors argue that these models often switch between reasoning paths without thoroughly exploring any of them, which can lead to incorrect answers, especially in complex mathematical tasks. The study involves systematic experiments revealing a correlation between frequent thought switching and incorrect results across three difficult test sets using two open-source o1-like models. To quantify underthinking, the authors introduce a new metric that assesses token efficiency in incorrect responses. They also propose a decoding strategy called TIP (thought switching penalty) designed to encourage deeper reasoning by penalizing premature transitions between thoughts. Experimental results indicate that this approach significantly enhances accuracy on challenging datasets without necessitating further model training. Overall, the paper highlights important reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs while presenting a novel solution to improve their problem-solving capabilities. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**:  The core contribution of the paper lies in identifying and quantifying the phenomenon of underthinking in LLMs, which has not been thoroughly explored in prior research. By introducing a new metric and a decoding strategy to combat this issue, the authors present a meaningful advancement in understanding the cognitive processes of LLMs. The correlation between thought-switching behaviors and accuracy in solution-finding tasks adds a noteworthy dimension to discussions around LLM performance, especially in complex reasoning. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Metrics**: The introduction of a quantitative metric for underthinking is a valuable tool for both practitioners and researchers to assess LLM performance more effectively. 2. **Practical Implications**: The proposed decoding strategy offers a practical solution to enhance current models’ reasoning abilities without requiring extensive model retraining, which could have significant implications for further applications of LLMs in practical scenarios such as education or automated reasoning. 3. **Solid Experimentation**: The systematic evaluation using challenging test sets adds robustness to the findings, reinforcing the conclusions drawn from the research. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Generalizability**: The experiments focus on specific sets that may not encompass the full spectrum of reasoning abilities required in practical applications or more diverse datasets. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: While the paper successfully identifies a problem and proposes a solution, more in-depth analyses could explore why these thought transitions occur and how they might be influenced by factors, such as training data or model size. 3. **External Validity**: The reliance on specific open-source models might limit the findings' applicability to other architectures or proprietary models, which may behave differently under similar conditions. Taking these strengths and weaknesses into account, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of LLM research, particularly concerning their reasoning capabilities. However, while it opens the door for future exploration, it could benefit from broader analyses and a deeper exploration of the underlying causes of underthinking. Score: 8

- **Abstract**: Understanding and modeling lighting effects are fundamental tasks in computer vision and graphics. Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "DiffusionRenderer: Neural Inverse and Forward Rendering with Video Diffusion Models" presents a novel neural rendering framework that tackles both inverse and forward rendering challenges, which are critical for visual effects in computer graphics and vision. The authors propose DiffusionRenderer, which utilizes video diffusion model priors to derive G-buffers (depth and material information) from real-world video inputs. This innovation facilitates image editing and provides a foundation for photorealistic image generation without traditional light transport modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer outperforms existing methods significantly, suggesting its capabilities in practical applications like relighting, material modification, and realistic insertion of objects from a single video source. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of video diffusion models for both inverse and forward rendering tasks is a notable advancement, bridging a significant gap in traditional rendering techniques that often require high-fidelity inputs. 2. **Practical Applications:** The model's ability to generate realistic images and perform image editing tasks directly from video input presents a practical approach that can be seen in various industries, such as gaming, film, and augmented reality. 3. **Performance Metrics:** The claim of consistent outperformance compared to state-of-the-art techniques suggests rigorous validation and potential for practical deployment. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Accessibility:** While the model is powerful, the complexity of implementing video diffusion models may pose a barrier to widespread adoption, particularly for smaller or less resourceful research communities or industries. 2. **Data Dependence:** The requirement for high-quality real-world video inputs to train the model may limit its applicability in scenarios where such data is scarce, potentially hindering its utility in diverse environments. 3. **Scope of Evaluation:** While the paper presents promising results, further exploration into varied lighting conditions, material types, and scene complexities could strengthen its claims. Additionally, the long-term impact on render times and computational efficiency wasn’t extensively discussed. **Influence on the Field:** The innovation presented in this paper has the potential to significantly influence future research in neural rendering and graphics by prioritizing accessibility in generating detailed renderings from imperfect data. However, the direct applicability of the method might still be contingent on overcoming intrinsic limitations associated with the required data quality and model complexity. Taking into account both the strengths and the weaknesses, as well as the paper's potential for practical impact and further research directions, I assign a score of **8**. This reflects a strong and impactful contribution to the field, balanced with some reservations about real-world feasibility and implementation hurdles. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces a novel diffusion-based tokenizer, termed DiTo, for generating compact visual representations crucial for efficient image generative models. The authors argue that by utilizing diffusion L2 loss as a singular training objective, DiTo simplifies the typically complex training processes required for current state-of-the-art tokenizers, which rely on intricate heuristics and a combination of losses. The design and theoretical foundations of DiTo allow it to scale effectively, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to existing supervised tokenizers in both image reconstruction and subsequent image generation tasks. The results indicate that DiTo serves as a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to traditional image tokenizers. ### Critical Evaluation: The paper presents several notable strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: The use of a diffusion-based loss function as the sole criterion for training tokenizers is an innovative concept. It points towards unifying the framework for both image generation and tokenization, which could streamline practices in the field. 2. **Simplification of Training**: By minimizing the complexities inherent in existing tokenization methods that involve multiple heuristic components and loss balancing, the paper addresses significant usability concerns for researchers and practitioners in deep learning. 3. **Competitive Benchmarking**: Demonstrating that DiTo can achieve quality at par or better than established supervised methods is a substantial claim, adding to its credibility and potential impact on future work. However, there are also weaknesses that deserve attention: 1. **Limited Novelty in High-Level Concept**: While the approach is simpler and offers practical benefits, the concept of using objective functions from diffusion processes is not entirely new in the image generation context; several works have leveraged diffusion models previously. Hence, the contributions may be seen as an evolution rather than a breakthrough. 2. **Generalizability and Comparison**: While the paper claims effectiveness over state-of-the-art tokenizers, the specifics regarding the datasets used, the diversity of test conditions, and comparison metrics could be elaborated upon to reinforce the results' robustness. 3. **Impact on the Field**: The implications of adopting a self-supervised framework need exploration in diverse real-world applications, which may help gauge the true scalability and practical significance of DiTo. Considering the strengths of addressing complexity in training and offering competitive performance, alongside the weaknesses in novelty and the need for further validation of its broader impact, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid contribution that simplifies existing methodologies, with potential influence on future research and applications, but not without caveats regarding novelty and the depth of validation. **Score: 7**
