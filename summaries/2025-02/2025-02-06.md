- **Authors**: Qianhao Yuan, Yanjiang Liu, Yaojie Lu, Hongyu Lin, Ben He, Xianpei Han, Le Sun
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly fall into two architectures, each involving a trade-off between training and inference efficiency: embedding space alignment (e.g., LLaVA-1.5) is inefficient during inference, while cross-attention space alignment (e.g., Flamingo) is inefficient in training. In this paper, we compare these two architectures and identify the key factors for building efficient MLLMs. A primary difference between them lies in how attention is applied to visual tokens, particularly in their interactions with each other. To investigate whether attention among visual tokens is necessary, we propose a new self-attention mechanism, NAAViT (\textbf{N}o \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{A}mong \textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{T}okens), which eliminates this type of attention. Our pilot experiment on LLaVA-1.5 shows that attention among visual tokens is highly redundant. Based on these insights, we introduce SAISA (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{I}nput \textbf{S}pace \textbf{A}lignment), a novel architecture that enhance both training and inference efficiency. SAISA directly aligns visual features with the input spaces of NAAViT self-attention blocks, reducing computational overhead in both self-attention blocks and feed-forward networks (FFNs). Using the same configuration as LLaVA-1.5, SAISA reduces inference FLOPs by 66\% and training budget by 26\%, while achieving superior performance in terms of accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of SAISA across various LLMs and visual encoders. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/SAISA.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "SAISA: Towards Multimodal Large Language Models with Both Training and Inference Efficiency" investigates the efficiency trade-offs in two types of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): embedding space alignment and cross-attention space alignment. The authors analyze the necessity of attention among visual tokens and introduce a self-attention mechanism, NAAViT, which eliminates this inter-token attention, revealing its redundancy. Building on this, they present SAISA, a new architecture that aligns visual features directly with the input of NAAViT self-attention blocks, achieving notable reductions in computational overhead. Specifically, SAISA decreases inference FLOPs by 66% and training budget by 26%, while enhancing performance accuracy compared to the baseline LLaVA-1.5. The authors validate their findings with comprehensive ablation studies and commit to making the code and model publicly accessible. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its comparative analysis of two prominent MLLM architectures and the introduction of a new self-attention mechanism that minimizes computational redundancy. The proposition of NAAViT and SAISA showcases an innovative way to align visual tokens, which can significantly inform future MLLM designs. By effectively addressing efficiency in both training and inference—a pressing issue in the field—the authors contribute a valuable perspective that could lead to more resource-efficient models. However, the paper could benefit from a wider exploration of the implications of removing attention among visual tokens. While the authors claim this is redundant, the extent to which this affects model performance across various tasks remains somewhat unaddressed. Additionally, the performance benchmarks referenced are based solely on LLaVA-1.5; broader performance evaluations across different datasets and tasks could enhance the generalizability of their findings. The methodology appears sound, and the experimental results are promising, fostering optimism about SAISA's potential application. Nonetheless, the significance of the findings could have been supported further through a comparison to existing models beyond LLaVA-1.5, which would help solidify claims regarding superiority and efficiency. In conclusion, while the paper presents a well-crafted and insightful advancement in MLLM architecture, its overarching impact could be amplified with broader empirical evaluations and context regarding the trade-offs introduced by the proposed attention mechanism. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's significant contributions to the efficiency of MLLMs and its potential to influence future research, balanced with the need for more comprehensive testing and discussion of its broader applicability in the field.

### Distribution Transformers: Fast Approximate Bayesian Inference With On-The-Fly Prior Adaptation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02463v1)
- **Authors**: George Whittle, Juliusz Ziomek, Jacob Rawling, Michael A Osborne
- **Abstract**: While Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for reasoning under uncertainty, its widespread adoption is limited by the intractability of exact posterior computation, necessitating the use of approximate inference. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, or demand costly retraining when priors change, limiting their utility, particularly in sequential inference problems such as real-time sensor fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce the Distribution Transformer -- a novel architecture that can learn arbitrary distribution-to-distribution mappings. Our method can be trained to map a prior to the corresponding posterior, conditioned on some dataset -- thus performing approximate Bayesian inference. Our novel architecture represents a prior distribution as a (universally-approximating) Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and transforms it into a GMM representation of the posterior. The components of the GMM attend to each other via self-attention, and to the datapoints via cross-attention. We demonstrate that Distribution Transformers both maintain flexibility to vary the prior, and significantly reduces computation times-from minutes to milliseconds-while achieving log-likelihood performance on par with or superior to existing approximate inference methods across tasks such as sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference with hyperpriors.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel architecture called the Distribution Transformer, designed to address the challenges associated with Bayesian inference, particularly in scenarios requiring approximate inference with adaptable priors. Existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency or require extensive retraining when priors are adjusted. The Distribution Transformer maps prior distributions, modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), to corresponding posterior distributions using a transformer architecture, which incorporates both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. This results in a flexible system that can efficiently accommodate varying priors while significantly decreasing computation times—from minutes to milliseconds. The authors demonstrate that the Distribution Transformer can achieve competitive or superior log-likelihood performance compared to existing methods across various applications, including sequential inference, quantum system parameter inference, and Gaussian Process predictive posterior inference. ### Evaluation **Novelty:** The Distribution Transformer introduces an innovative approach by synthesizing transformer architectures and GMMs for approximating Bayesian inference. While transformer models have transformed several domains, their application in Bayesian inference with a focus on adaptability to prior changes is relatively novel. The concept of self-attention in GMM components to facilitate efficient distribution mappings stands out as an inventive contribution. **Significance:** The paper addresses a pressing need in the field of approximate Bayesian inference, particularly for real-time applications that require continuous adjustment of priors. The ability to perform inference much faster while maintaining robust performance can have significant implications in fields such as robotics, sensor fusion, and other domains where computational resources are limited.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of GMMs and transformers is novel and promising. 2. **Efficiency Improvement:** The reduction in computational time while preserving or improving performance is a compelling strength. 3. **Broad Applicability:** The framework's applicability to various types of inference tasks enhances its relevance to the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The architecture's complexity may deter some practitioners, especially in simpler use cases where simpler methods may suffice. 2. **Potential Overfitting:** While the model's flexibility is advantageous, there may be concerns regarding its performance with smaller datasets or under specific distributions. 3. **Experimental Validation:** While the results are promising, further validation across a broader set of real-world applications would strengthen claims of generalizability. **Conclusion:** The paper captures a compelling synthesis of modern neural architectures with classical probabilistic models, addressing a notable gap in the capacity for efficient, adaptable Bayesian inference. The strengths of the study—particularly in terms of innovation and significant performance gains—present a strong case for its relevance in the current landscape of machine learning. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s substantial contributions while also acknowledging some limitations regarding implementation complexity and the need for further validation in practical scenarios. The Distribution Transformer can be considered a significant advancement within the context of Bayesian inference frameworks.

### Towards Consistent and Controllable Image Synthesis for Face Editing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02465v1)
- **Authors**: Mengting Wei, Tuomas Varanka, Yante Li, Xingxun Jiang, Huai-Qian Khor, Guoying Zhao
- **Abstract**: Current face editing methods mainly rely on GAN-based techniques, but recent focus has shifted to diffusion-based models due to their success in image reconstruction. However, diffusion models still face challenges in manipulating fine-grained attributes and preserving consistency of attributes that should remain unchanged. To address these issues and facilitate more convenient editing of face images, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of Stable-Diffusion models and crude 3D face models to control the lighting, facial expression and head pose of a portrait photo. We observe that this task essentially involve combinations of target background, identity and different face attributes. We aim to sufficiently disentangle the control of these factors to enable high-quality of face editing. Specifically, our method, coined as RigFace, contains: 1) A Spatial Arrtibute Encoder that provides presise and decoupled conditions of background, pose, expression and lighting; 2) An Identity Encoder that transfers identity features to the denoising UNet of a pre-trained Stable-Diffusion model; 3) An Attribute Rigger that injects those conditions into the denoising UNet. Our model achieves comparable or even superior performance in both identity preservation and photorealism compared to existing face editing models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Towards Consistent and Controllable Image Synthesis for Face Editing" addresses challenges in current face editing methods, particularly those employing GANs and newer diffusion models. The authors introduce a method called RigFace that utilizes Stable-Diffusion models along with 3D face models to improve manipulation of complex facial attributes while maintaining consistency. RigFace comprises three main components: a Spatial Attribute Encoder for disentangling background and facial attributes, an Identity Encoder for transferring identity features, and an Attribute Rigger for integrating these conditions into a pre-trained denoising UNet. The proposed approach demonstrates competitive results in terms of identity preservation and photorealism compared to other contemporary face editing techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a promising new methodology for face editing that contextualizes recent advancements in diffusion models, which is a significant shift from traditional GAN-based approaches. This is particularly relevant as the field has been moving towards more stable and high-fidelity image generation techniques enabled by diffusion models. The integration of 3D face models adds an interesting layer of control over various face attributes, potentially leading to more realistic and manageable edits. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The use of a combination of Stable-Diffusion models and 3D face models to address specific editing challenges represents a thoughtful blending of technologies. 2. **Decoupling Factors**: The authors effectively identify key factors (background, pose, expression, lighting) in face editing and propose a method to disentangle them, which could enhance both the versatility and usability of face editing tools. 3. **Performance Claims**: The paper asserts that RigFace offers superior identity preservation and photorealism, which, if substantiated with rigorous experiments, could significantly impact the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The paper could benefit from a more detailed empirical validation process with comprehensive comparisons to existing methods, rather than just claims of superior performance. 2. **Limited Contextual Comparisons**: While it highlights improvements, the limitations and challenges of current face editing approaches could be more thoroughly discussed to contextualize its contributions. 3. **Generality of the Approach**: The reliance on 3D models may not apply universally to all types of face images, potentially limiting the method's applicability. **Overall Assessment:** While RigFace presents a compelling advancement in the field of face editing, especially within the burgeoning domain of diffusion models, its overall impact is contingent on the empirical evidence provided in the paper. It also raises questions about its practical applicability across diverse scenarios in face synthesis. The integration of different modalities is a step forward, but the robustness of the methods needs clearer demonstration. **Score: 7**

### Modular Training of Neural Networks aids Interpretability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02470v1)
- **Authors**: Satvik Golechha, Maheep Chaudhary, Joan Velja, Alessandro Abate, Nandi Schoots
- **Abstract**: An approach to improve neural network interpretability is via clusterability, i.e., splitting a model into disjoint clusters that can be studied independently. We define a measure for clusterability and show that pre-trained models form highly enmeshed clusters via spectral graph clustering. We thus train models to be more modular using a ``clusterability loss'' function that encourages the formation of non-interacting clusters. Using automated interpretability techniques, we show that our method can help train models that are more modular and learn different, disjoint, and smaller circuits. We investigate CNNs trained on MNIST and CIFAR, small transformers trained on modular addition, and language models. Our approach provides a promising direction for training neural networks that learn simpler functions and are easier to interpret.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents an innovative method to enhance the interpretability of neural networks through a concept termed "clusterability," which involves creating disjoint clusters of features that can be analyzed independently. The authors develop a metric for clusterability and demonstrate that conventional pre-trained models exhibit complex interconnections. To counteract this, they propose a "clusterability loss" function during training, which encourages the development of less interdependent (modular) feature representations. They validate this approach through experiments on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on datasets like MNIST and CIFAR, along with other models including small transformers for modular tasks and language models. The findings indicate that the proposed method leads to more interpretable networks that learn distinct and simpler functions. **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty**: The concept of clusterability as a measure of interpretability is a significant advancement as it provides a quantifiable way to assess how features interact within a neural network. The introduction of a loss function aimed at enhancing modularity contributes a fresh perspective to the ongoing discussion about model interpretability in neural networks. 2. **Significance**: The significance of the paper lies in addressing a fundamental problem in machine learning—the interpretability of complex models. Improved interpretability is crucial for building trust in AI systems, particularly in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance. By offering methods to create networks that are both functionally simpler and more interpretable, the paper has the potential to influence future research directions and methodologies in the field. 3. **Strengths**:     - The integration of theoretical foundations (spectral graph clustering) with practical applications (training on standard datasets) makes the work robust and comprehensive.    - The empirical results support the proposed method's effectiveness in producing modular networks, which is a critical aspect of the claims made. 4. **Weaknesses**:     - The paper could benefit from broader validation across more diverse architectures and datasets to strengthen the generalizability of their findings.    - While the method shows promising results, a thorough comparison with existing interpretability techniques may have provided a clearer context of its advantages and limitations. In conclusion, the paper significantly contributes to the intersection of neural network training and interpretability, presenting a novel approach that could inspire further research and exploration. The potential implications for creating simpler, more interpretable models are particularly noteworthy, positioning this work as a valuable addition to the literature. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown continuously improving multilingual capabilities, and even small-scale open-source models have demonstrated rapid performance enhancement. In this paper, we systematically explore the abilities of open LLMs with less than ten billion parameters to handle multilingual machine translation (MT) tasks. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on six popular LLMs and find that models like Gemma2-9B exhibit impressive multilingual translation capabilities. We then introduce the Parallel-First Monolingual-Second (PFMS) data mixing strategy in the continual pretraining stage to further enhance the MT performance and present GemmaX2-28, a 9B model achieving top-tier multilingual translation performance across 28 languages. Specifically, GemmaX2-28 consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models such as TowerInstruct and XALMA and achieves competitive performance with Google Translate and GPT-4-turbo.

### A Training-Free Length Extrapolation Approach for LLMs: Greedy Attention Logit Interpolation (GALI)
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02659v1)
- **Authors**: Yan Li, Tianyi Zhang, Zechuan Li, Soyeon Caren Han
- **Abstract**: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to process inputs exceeding their training context window, with performance degrading due to positional out-of-distribution (O.O.D.) that disrupt attention computations. Existing solutions, fine-tuning and training-free methods, are limited by computational inefficiency, attention logit outliers or loss of local positional information. To address this, we propose Greedy Attention Logit Interpolation (GALI), a training-free length extrapolation method that maximizes the utilization of pretrained positional intervals while avoiding attention logit outliers through attention logit interpolation. The result demonstrates that GALI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods. Our findings reveal that LLMs interpret positional intervals unevenly within their training context window, suggesting that extrapolating within a smaller positional interval range yields superior results-even for short-context tasks. GALI represents a significant step toward resolving the positional O.O.D. challenge, enabling more reliable long-text understanding in LLMs. Our implementation of GALI, along with the experiments from our paper, is open-sourced at https://github.com/AcademyCityL/GALI.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "A Training-Free Length Extrapolation Approach for LLMs: Greedy Attention Logit Interpolation (GALI)" addresses a critical limitation of Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) — their inability to effectively manage inputs that exceed their training context window. The deteriorating performance due to out-of-distribution positional inputs is a known challenge. The authors propose GALI, a training-free method that enhances the model's ability to extrapolate by employing attention logit interpolation and leveraging pretrained positional intervals. The results indicate that GALI outperforms existing state-of-the-art training-free methods while achieving better performance in both extrapolated long contexts and even within short-context tasks. The implementation of GALI is available for public use, which contributes to the transparency and reproducibility of their findings. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Innovation**: GALI introduces a novel mechanism (attention logit interpolation) that aims to enhance the performance of LLMs in the context of positional out-of-distribution issues. The focus on maximizing pretrained positional intervals without extensive retraining is a refreshing approach in the field, especially as many existing methods involve computationally intensive fine-tuning.    2. **Practical Impact**: By demonstrating consistent improvements over prior training-free methods, GALI presents a practical solution that could be implemented across various applications, where long-text understanding is necessary. The open-source implementation further amplifies its utility for researchers wishing to replicate or build upon these findings. 3. **Findings on Positional Interpretation**: The paper introduces the insight that LLMs interpret positional intervals unevenly, suggesting that smaller positional ranges may yield better results. This observation could stimulate further research into positional embeddings and their efficient utilization. **Strengths**: - The methodology appears robust, effectively tackling a well-recognized problem in LLMs. - The results are promising, showcasing a clear advantage over previous methods, indicative of a meaningful contribution to the field. - The accessible implementation encourages adoption and further exploration by the research community. **Weaknesses**: - The paper does not deeply explore the underlying mechanisms of attention logit interpolation and may lack thorough theoretical backing or discussion on potential limitations of the GALI method itself. - The empirical evaluation, while it shows improvement, could be expanded to demonstrate a wider range of applications or contexts to fully assert its generalizability. - Comparisons with fine-tuning methods remain limited, and thus, the trade-offs between training-free and fine-tuned approaches could be better articulated. **Conclusion**: The paper delivers a notable advancement in the quest for better long-context handling by LLMs. It provides useful insights and practical methodologies that are indeed relevant to contemporary research, but it could benefit from deeper theoretical analysis and broader empirical validations. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to resolving a critical challenge in LLMs while acknowledging that some theoretical underpinnings and wider-ranging assessments could enhance its impact. Overall, GALI demonstrates strong potential to influence future research directions in the field of natural language processing.

### Transformers Boost the Performance of Decision Trees on Tabular Data across Sample Sizes
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02672v1)
- **Authors**: Mayuka Jayawardhana, Renbo Tu, Samuel Dooley, Valeriia Cherepanova, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Frank Hutter, Colin White, Tom Goldstein, Micah Goldblum
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) perform remarkably well on tabular datasets in zero- and few-shot settings, since they can extract meaning from natural language column headers that describe features and labels. Similarly, TabPFN, a recent non-LLM transformer pretrained on numerous tables for in-context learning, has demonstrated excellent performance for dataset sizes up to a thousand samples. In contrast, gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are typically trained from scratch on each dataset without benefiting from pretraining data and must learn the relationships between columns from their entries alone since they lack natural language understanding. LLMs and TabPFN excel on small tabular datasets where a strong prior is essential, yet they are not competitive with GBDTs on medium or large datasets, since their context lengths are limited. In this paper, we propose a simple and lightweight approach for fusing large language models and TabPFN with gradient-boosted decision trees, which allows scalable GBDTs to benefit from the natural language capabilities and pretraining of transformers. We name our fusion methods LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost, respectively. While matching or surpassing the performance of the transformer at sufficiently small dataset sizes and GBDTs at sufficiently large sizes, LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost outperform both standalone components on a wide range of dataset sizes in between. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance against numerous baselines and ensembling algorithms. We find that PFN-Boost achieves the best average performance among all methods we test for all but very small dataset sizes. We release our code at http://github.com/MayukaJ/LLM-Boost .
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Transformers Boost the Performance of Decision Trees on Tabular Data across Sample Sizes" addresses the performance disparities between large language models (LLMs) and gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) in analyzing tabular datasets. While LLMs and the TabPFN transformer excel at smaller sample sizes due to their pretraining and ability to understand natural language, they struggle with larger datasets where GBDTs typically perform better without pretraining. To bridge this gap, the authors propose two novel methods: LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost, which integrate the capabilities of LLMs and TabPFN with GBDTs. These methods not only match but often exceed the performance of standalone models across a range of dataset sizes. The authors provide empirical evidence of superior performance across various benchmarks and release their code to facilitate further research. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Innovation**: The fusion of transformers with GBDTs represents a noteworthy innovation in the machine learning landscape, particularly given the widespread use and popularity of these two types of models in tabular data analysis. 2. **Methodological Contribution**: The introduction of LLM-Boost and PFN-Boost is a significant contribution since it leverages strengths from both transformer-based models and traditional gradient-boosting methods. Such hybrid approaches can help balance performance across varying dataset sizes, addressing a recognized limitation of individual approaches. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide comprehensive experimentation and validation against existing baselines, which strengthens the validity of their claims and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across sample sizes. This empirical support is crucial for establishing the practical utility of their methods in real-world applications. **Strengths:** - The paper tackles a relevant problem in machine learning regarding the processing of tabular data, a format commonly found across numerous domains. - The proposed methods show promising results, especially for in-between dataset sizes where existing models struggle. - The release of code enhances reproducibility and encourages further research, enabling the community to build upon their work. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper offers great improvements across several dataset sizes, it would benefit from a more extensive examination of the conditions under which these models might fail. This includes discussing any limitations of the models when applied to extremely high-dimensional datasets or those with unique characteristics. - The integration approach may introduce complexities that complicate its implementation or require more computational resources, which could be a barrier for less equipped practitioners. **Overall Assessment**: Given the balance of innovation, empirical validation, and the addressing of a significant gap in existing methodologies, this paper presents a compelling advancement in the field of machine learning, particularly concerning tabular data analysis. **Score: 8**

This integrated approach potentially addresses the limitations of existing systems that operate in isolation, thereby enhancing clinical utility. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of state-of-the-art analysis tools with a multimodal reasoning framework is a notable innovation, bridging a critical gap in the application of AI in medical imaging. 2. **Robust Benchmarking**: The introduction of ChestAgentBench as a substantial and diverse evaluation metric showcases the rigor of assessments and provides a valuable resource for future research. 3. **Performance Validation**: Demonstrating state-of-the-art performance against existing models strengthens the paper’s claims about MedRAX's efficacy, suggesting it could have a practical impact in clinical settings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the performance metrics are impressive, the paper does not sufficiently address how MedRAX will perform in varied real-world clinical environments, which are often more complex. 2. **Scalability**: The execution and response time of MedRAX in clinical workflows could be a potential concern, particularly in fast-paced settings where time-sensitive decisions are crucial. 3. **Dependence on Data Quality**: The efficacy of AI models can often be limited by the quality and diversity of the training data. There is no detailed discussion regarding the data used to train the underlying models, which could affect reproducibility and generalization. ### Conclusion Overall, the contributions made by the MedRAX system are significant in advancing medical AI, particularly within the domain of CXR interpretation. However, practical implications in diverse clinical environments and scalability issues remain areas for further exploration.  **Score: 8**  The score reflects a solid contribution with practical implications, but also acknowledges the need for further validation and exploration of real-world applicability and scalability.

### Exploring LLMs Impact on Student-Created User Stories and Acceptance Testing in Software Development
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02675v1)
- **Authors**: Allan Brockenbrough, Henry Feild, Dominic Salinas
- **Abstract**: In Agile software development methodology, a user story describes a new feature or functionality from an end user's perspective. The user story details may also incorporate acceptance testing criteria, which can be developed through negotiation with users. When creating stories from user feedback, the software engineer may maximize their usefulness by considering story attributes, including scope, independence, negotiability, and testability. This study investigates how LLMs (large language models), with guided instructions, affect undergraduate software engineering students' ability to transform user feedback into user stories. Students, working individually, were asked to analyze user feedback comments, appropriately group related items, and create user stories following the principles of INVEST, a framework for assessing user stories. We found that LLMs help students develop valuable stories with well-defined acceptance criteria. However, students tend to perform better without LLMs when creating user stories with an appropriate scope.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper investigates the impact of large language models (LLMs) on the ability of undergraduate software engineering students to develop user stories and acceptance tests from user feedback in the context of Agile software development. Through a structured experiment, students created user stories based on user feedback, utilizing the INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable). The findings reveal that while LLMs enhance the quality of user stories, particularly in defining acceptance criteria, students perform better in terms of story scope when not using LLMs. This highlights a nuanced interaction between AI assistance and student performance in software development tasks. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a novel exploration of LLMs within the context of educational software engineering, examining both the benefits and limitations of these tools in transforming user feedback into user stories. The novelty arises from the focus on an educational setting, a relatively unexplored area compared to general LLM applications, and the specific framing of user stories within Agile methodology.  Strengths: 1. **Relevance**: The topic addresses the increasing use of AI in educational contexts, particularly in software engineering, providing insights into pedagogical practices. 2. **Clarity**: The framework used for analysis (INVEST) is well-defined and aligns with industry standards, making the research practical and pertinent. 3. **Empirical Study**: The study employs a controlled approach by comparing students' performances with and without LLMs, adding rigor to the findings.

- **Abstract**: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling independent control over motion and identity. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper proposes a new framework for controllable video generation called Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN). Despite advancements in video generation, existing methods often struggle with nuanced control due to a lack of distinct separation between various video concepts. CoVoGAN addresses this by disentangling static and dynamic latent variables, allowing for precise and independent manipulation of motion and identity in generated videos. The authors emphasize two theoretical principles: the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, which ensure that any modifications lead to meaningful changes while maintaining video coherence. A Temporal Transition Module is introduced to implement these principles, which was validated through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, showcasing improvements in both video quality and controllability. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Framework**: The paper provides a solid theoretical foundation for its approach, ensuring that the disentanglement of concepts is not just heuristic but backed by rigorous analysis. 2. **Innovative Disentanglement**: By focusing on static vs. dynamic variables and attempting to isolate their influences, CoVoGAN introduces a novel perspective that could enhance controllability significantly. 3. **Practical Relevance**: The method is designed to be integrated as a plug-in to existing GAN architectures, making it adaptable and potentially impactful for practitioners in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the theoretical insights are promising, the practical implementation of such a framework may be complex, as disentangling latent spaces effectively is often a non-trivial task. 2. **Generalization**: The experiments, while comprehensive, may not fully demonstrate the robustness of CoVoGAN across all possible variations in video generation tasks. The reliance on specific benchmarks could limit the perceived applicability of the method. 3. **Comparison to Established Methods**: The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, showing not just improvements in quality and controllability, but also addressing possible shortcomings in the existing frameworks. **Potential Impact**: The approach has the potential to advance the field of video generation significantly, particularly in applications requiring high levels of control, such as animation and film. However, the detailed implementation challenges will determine how effectively the community can leverage this innovation. Given these points, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects strong novelty and a significant contribution to the area of controllable video generation, while acknowledging that practical complexities and a need for broader validation temper its impact. The approach offers a solid foundation for future work that could further refine these concepts and address some of the weaknesses identified.  **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02715v1)
- **Authors**: Riddhi More, Jeremy S. Bradbury
- **Abstract**: Flaky tests exhibit non-deterministic behavior during execution and they may pass or fail without any changes to the program under test. Detecting and classifying these flaky tests is crucial for maintaining the robustness of automated test suites and ensuring the overall reliability and confidence in the testing. However, flaky test detection and classification is challenging due to the variability in test behavior, which can depend on environmental conditions and subtle code interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising approaches to address this challenge, with fine-tuning and few-shot learning (FSL) emerging as viable techniques. With enough data fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM can achieve high accuracy, making it suitable for organizations with more resources. Alternatively, we introduce FlakyXbert, an FSL approach that employs a Siamese network architecture to train efficiently with limited data. To understand the performance and cost differences between these two methods, we compare fine-tuning on larger datasets with FSL in scenarios restricted by smaller datasets. Our evaluation involves two existing flaky test datasets, FlakyCat and IDoFT. Our results suggest that while fine-tuning can achieve high accuracy, FSL provides a cost-effective approach with competitive accuracy, which is especially beneficial for organizations or projects with limited historical data available for training. These findings underscore the viability of both fine-tuning and FSL in flaky test detection and classification with each suited to different organizational needs and resource availability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "An Analysis of LLM Fine-Tuning and Few-Shot Learning for Flaky Test Detection and Classification" addresses the issue of flaky tests—tests that yield inconsistent results without corresponding changes in the codebase. It highlights the significance of effectively detecting and classifying such tests to ensure the reliability of automated testing. The authors explore two main techniques for this problem: fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and few-shot learning (FSL). They introduce FlakyXbert, an FSL model leveraging a Siamese network architecture designed to work efficiently with limited datasets. The study includes an evaluation using two existing datasets, FlakyCat and IDoFT, showing that while fine-tuning can yield high accuracy with sufficient data, FSL presents a cost-effective alternative that remains competitive in accuracy for projects with restricted resources. The findings advocate for the applicability of both methods depending on the organizational context and available data. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a nuanced exploration of technologies (fine-tuning LLMs and few-shot learning) in a critical area of software testing, namely flaky test detection, which is a significant and relevant issue in the field of software quality assurance. The introduction of FlakyXbert represents an innovative application of a Siamese network for FSL, addressing the limitations faced by organizations with limited datasets.  **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance to Industry:** Flaky tests are a prevalent problem in software development, and new approaches to tackle these issues are highly valuable to the field. 2. **Method Comparison:** The structured comparison of fine-tuning versus FSL provides significant insights, informing practitioners about which method may better fit their resource conditions. 3. **Data-Driven Evaluation:** Utilizing established datasets such as FlakyCat and IDoFT strengthens the paper’s findings and conclusions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Novel Algorithms:** While the paper effectively applies existing methods, it does not introduce fundamentally new algorithms or significant modifications that could represent a major breakthrough. 2. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** The evaluation focuses on two datasets; a broader generalization to more diverse situations may be needed to enhance robustness. 3. **Resource Dependency:** The reliance on LLMs requires substantial computational resources, which could limit scalability for smaller organizations regardless of the proposed advantages of FSL. **Potential Influence:** The study is likely to encourage further research and development in automated test reliability and foster more adaptive approaches in flaky test management, particularly useful for teams unable to secure large datasets or significant computational resources. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's solid contributions and relevance to ongoing challenges within software testing. However, limitations in the novelty of algorithmic developments and minor issues regarding its generalizability temper the impact. The findings provide a valuable resource for adapting existing technologies to a pressing issue but fall short of providing transformative insights or breakthroughs that would warrant a higher score.

- **Authors**: Iker García-Ferrero
- **Abstract**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has seen remarkable advances in recent years, particularly with the emergence of Large Language Models that have achieved unprecedented performance across many tasks. However, these developments have mainly benefited a small number of high-resource languages such as English. The majority of languages still face significant challenges due to the scarcity of training data and computational resources. To address this issue, this thesis focuses on cross-lingual transfer learning, a research area aimed at leveraging data and models from high-resource languages to improve NLP performance for low-resource languages. Specifically, we focus on Sequence Labeling tasks such as Named Entity Recognition, Opinion Target Extraction, and Argument Mining. The research is structured around three main objectives: (1) advancing data-based cross-lingual transfer learning methods through improved translation and annotation projection techniques, (2) developing enhanced model-based transfer learning approaches utilizing state-of-the-art multilingual models, and (3) applying these methods to real-world problems while creating open-source resources that facilitate future research in low-resource NLP. More specifically, this thesis presents a new method to improve data-based transfer with T-Projection, a state-of-the-art annotation projection method that leverages text-to-text multilingual models and machine translation systems. T-Projection significantly outperforms previous annotation projection methods by a wide margin. For model-based transfer, we introduce a constrained decoding algorithm that enhances cross-lingual Sequence Labeling in zero-shot settings using text-to-text models. Finally, we develop Medical mT5, the first multilingual text-to-text medical model, demonstrating the practical impact of our research on real-world applications.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Cross-Lingual Transfer for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing" addresses the disparity in NLP advancements between high-resource and low-resource languages. Recognizing the limitations faced by most languages due to insufficient training data, the thesis focuses on cross-lingual transfer learning to enhance NLP tasks in low-resource settings. It emphasizes three main goals: improving data-based transfer methods with innovative translation and annotation techniques, developing model-based transfer learning using advanced multilingual models, and addressing real-world NLP challenges while creating open-source resources. Key contributions include T-Projection, an enhanced annotation projection method, a constrained decoding algorithm for zero-shot cross-lingual Sequence Labeling, and the development of Medical mT5, a multilingual model tailored for medical applications.  **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methods:** T-Projection stands out as it effectively leverages text-to-text multilingual models and machine translation to significantly enhance transfer learning performance. This addresses a key challenge in low-resource languages, marking a noteworthy improvement over existing techniques. 2. **Practical Applications:** The introduction of Medical mT5 demonstrates a clear path from research to application, showing that the methodologies proposed can have real-world impact in specialized domains. 3. **Open Resources:** The commitment to create open-source resources is a significant advantage for future research, fostering community engagement and collaboration in low-resource NLP. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Scope:** While the paper claims significant improvements, it should provide more extensive comparative evaluations with other state-of-the-art methodologies to substantiate the claims. 2. **Generality of Results:** The methods might be heavily focused on specific tasks like Named Entity Recognition and Opinion Target Extraction—applicability to a broader array of NLP tasks could be further validated. 3. **Dependence on High-Resource Models:** While leveraging high-resource data is the crux of the proposed methods, strategies to mitigate risks associated with bias or misrepresentation from these models are not sufficiently discussed. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of low-resource NLP through novel methodologies and practical applications, while also addressing an important gap in the research landscape.

- **Authors**: Jeonghoon Kim, Byeongchan Lee, Cheonbok Park, Yeontaek Oh, Beomjun Kim, Taehwan Yoo, Seongjin Shin, Dongyoon Han, Jinwoo Shin, Kang Min Yoo
- **Abstract**: Designing Transformer architectures with the optimal layer normalization (LN) strategy that ensures large-scale training stability and expedite convergence has remained elusive, even in this era of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we present a comprehensive analytical foundation for understanding how different LN strategies influence training dynamics in large-scale Transformer training. Until recently, Pre-LN and Post-LN have long dominated standard practices despite their limitations in large-scale training. However, several open-source large-scale models have recently begun silently adopting a third strategy without much explanation. This strategy places layer normalization (LN) peripherally around sublayers, a design we term Peri-LN. While Peri-LN has demonstrated promising empirical performance, its precise mechanisms and benefits remain almost unexplored. Our in-depth analysis shows that Peri-LN strikes an ideal balance in variance growth -- unlike Pre-LN and Post-LN, which are prone to vanishing gradients and ``massive activations.'' To validate our theoretical insight, we conduct large-scale experiments on Transformers up to 3.2B parameters, showing that Peri-LN consistently achieves more balanced variance growth, steadier gradient flow, and convergence stability. Our results suggest that Peri-LN warrants broader consideration for large-scale Transformer architectures, providing renewed insights into the optimal placement and application of LN.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Peri-LN: Revisiting Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture" addresses the challenges of optimizing layer normalization (LN) strategies within the Transformer architecture for large-scale training. It highlights the prevailing use of Pre-LN and Post-LN strategies while introducing a novel approach termed Peri-LN, where LN is applied peripherally around sublayers. The authors provide a detailed analysis of how different LN strategies impact training dynamics, particularly focusing on variance growth, gradient flow, and convergence stability. Their empirical results, drawn from experiments on Transformers with up to 3.2 billion parameters, suggest that Peri-LN significantly improves training consistency without the issues associated with the existing normalization strategies. This indicates that Peri-LN should be more widely considered in the design of large-scale Transformer architectures. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its introduction of Peri-LN, a previously unexamined layer normalization strategy that appears to enhance training stability and efficiency over existing methods. The authors not only provide theoretical insights into the performance implications of various LN strategies but also back these insights with extensive empirical findings from large-scale experiments. **Strengths:** 1. **New Contribution**: Introducing Peri-LN fills a gap in existing knowledge and offers a solution to known issues with Pre-LN and Post-LN in large model training. 2. **Theoretical and Empirical Analysis**: The dual approach combining a rigorous theoretical framework with practical experiments gives credibility to the results and suggestions. 3. **Practical Relevance**: The improvements shown in convergence stability and gradient flow are relevant for researchers and practitioners working with large-scale Transformers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Depth**: While the paper contrasts Peri-LN with Pre-LN and Post-LN, it could delve deeper into the underlying reasons behind the performance differences, beyond just variance growth. 2. **Limited Contextualization**: The adoption of Peri-LN may require further context regarding its implementation and adaptability across different model types and tasks, which could generalize its applicability. 3. **Absence of Long-term Implications**: While the results are compelling, the paper does not extensively discuss the long-term effects of Peri-LN in various model settings and its influence on broader architecture design paradigms. Despite these weaknesses, the introduction of a new LN strategy that consistently demonstrates improved performance is a valuable addition to the field of deep learning, especially in the context of large language models. Taking all factors into account, this paper represents a significant contribution to the understanding and optimization of layer normalization within Transformer architectures. It offers a practical solution that could influence future model designs and training practices. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: While large language models have facilitated breakthroughs in many applications of artificial intelligence, their inherent largeness makes them computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we document the development of SmolLM2, a state-of-the-art "small" (1.7 billion parameter) language model (LM). To attain strong performance, we overtrain SmolLM2 on ~11 trillion tokens of data using a multi-stage training process that mixes web text with specialized math, code, and instruction-following data. We additionally introduce new specialized datasets (FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk) at stages where we found existing datasets to be problematically small or low-quality. To inform our design decisions, we perform both small-scale ablations as well as a manual refinement process that updates the dataset mixing rates at each stage based on the performance at the previous stage. Ultimately, we demonstrate that SmolLM2 outperforms other recent small LMs including Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. To facilitate future research on LM development as well as applications of small LMs, we release both SmolLM2 as well as all of the datasets we prepared in the course of this project.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents SmolLM2, a compact yet high-performing language model with 1.7 billion parameters, developed to address the limitations of large language models in resource-constrained environments. The authors detail a multi-stage training methodology involving overtraining on approximately 11 trillion tokens, combining web text with specialized datasets targeting mathematics, programming, and instruction-following tasks. New datasets, including FineMath, Stack-Edu, and SmolTalk, were created due to inadequacies in existing resources. The authors employed both experimental ablations and a manual refinement process to optimize dataset mixing rates throughout training. The results demonstrate that SmolLM2 surpasses other contemporary small language models like Qwen2.5-1.5B and Llama3.2-1B. Additionally, the authors provide access to SmolLM2 and all related datasets, aiming to promote future research and development in small language models. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Relevance:** SmolLM2 addresses a critical need in the field of artificial intelligence for efficient models that are both performant and deployable in low-resource environments.

The advancements seem to build upon existing frameworks rather than revolutionize them. 2. **Scale of Comparison:** The paper mainly compares SmolLM2 with a limited number of existing models in a similar size category. A broader evaluation encompassing a wider array of language models might provide deeper insights into its comparative advantages. 3. **No User Studies:** The paper lacks practical user studies that could validate the model’s performance in real-world applications, which would have strengthened the claims about its utility and effectiveness. **Potential Influence:** The development of efficient small language models is a growing area of interest due to rising computational costs associated with larger models. SmolLM2's innovative training techniques and new datasets could inspire further research in optimizing model performance with limited resources, which is significant as AI technology continues to advance. ### Overall Score After weighing the strengths against the weaknesses, this paper represents a significant yet incremental enhancement in the domain of small language models. It effectively addresses practical challenges and contributes valuable resources, but does not introduce groundbreaking concepts. Therefore, it merits a score that reflects these observations: **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Yang Li
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) has brought forth a diverse range of models with varying capabilities that excel in different tasks and domains. However, selecting the optimal LLM for user queries often involves a challenging trade-off between accuracy and cost, a problem exacerbated by the diverse demands of individual queries. In this work, we present a novel framework that formulates the LLM selection process as a multi-armed bandit problem, enabling dynamic and intelligent routing of queries to the most appropriate model. Our approach incorporates a preference-conditioned dynamic routing mechanism, allowing users to specify their preferences at inference time, thereby offering a customizable balance between performance and cost. Additionally, our selection policy is designed to generalize to unseen LLMs, ensuring adaptability to new models as they emerge. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in both accuracy and cost-effectiveness across various LLM platforms, showcasing the potential of our framework to adaptively optimize LLM selection in real-world scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "LLM Bandit: Cost-Efficient LLM Generation via Preference-Conditioned Dynamic Routing" addresses the challenge of selecting the optimal large language model (LLM) for specific user queries, balancing accuracy and cost. It introduces a framework that treats LLM selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, enabling real-time routing of queries based on user-specified preferences. This dynamic routing mechanism allows for a tailored compromise between performance and cost. The methodology is designed to generalize across unseen LLMs, providing flexibility as new models are introduced. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach yields notable enhancements in both accuracy and cost-efficiency across various LLM platforms. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of this paper lies in its framing of the LLM selection process as a multi-armed bandit problem, which is a fresh perspective in the landscape of LLM adaptation and user-centric model selection. This innovative approach, combined with the introduction of a preference-conditioned dynamic routing mechanism, offers a flexible and user-driven solution to a common problem faced in deploying LLMs in diverse applications.  However, the significance of the contribution can be critically assessed through several lenses: 1. **Strengths:**    - **Practical Relevance:** The problem addressed is highly relevant, as the proliferation of LLMs creates a practical need for intelligent model selection based on cost and performance.    - **Dynamic Routing:** Incorporating user preferences into the selection process is a step forward in personalization, which can enhance user satisfaction and efficiency. 2. **Weaknesses:**    - **Generalizability of Results:** While the paper claims adaptability to unseen LLMs, it would benefit from a more rigorous examination of the generalization capabilities and limits of the proposed framework.    - **Complexity of Preference Expression:** The mechanism for users to express preferences could be nuanced, and the paper could elaborate on how effectively this is implemented without overwhelming users.    - **Experimental Validation:** The results presented, while promising, would be strengthened by a broader range of experiments across more diverse LLMs and real-world tasks to validate the effectiveness of the approach under varying conditions. Overall, the paper presents a significant step in the field of LLMs by providing a novel framework for adaptive model selection. It balances innovation with practical applications, though further validation and clarity in user interaction could improve its impact. Given these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. This score reflects its notable contribution and relevance, balanced by the need for stronger experimental evidence and clarity regarding its practical implementation.  **Score: 7**

### PatchPilot: A Stable and Cost-Efficient Agentic Patching Framework
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02747v1)
- **Authors**: Hongwei Li, Yuheng Tang, Shiqi Wang, Wenbo Guo
- **Abstract**: Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-Bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and human-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Human-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel human-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-Bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "PatchPilot: A Stable and Cost-Efficient Agentic Patching Framework" introduces a novel approach to software patching that addresses limitations in current methodologies. It categorizes existing patching agents into two main types: agent-based planning methods, which leverage large language models (LLMs) for dynamic planning but are costly and unstable; and human-based planning methods, which are stable and cost-efficient but limited in efficacy due to pre-defined workflows.  PatchPilot aims to balance these trade-offs by proposing a human-based planning workflow comprising five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (the latter being a unique addition). The paper details custom designs for each component to enhance effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that PatchPilot outperforms existing open-source methods on the SWE-Bench benchmark while maintaining low operational costs (under $1 per instance) and improved stability. An ablation study is included to substantiate the choices of designs in each component. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**   PatchPilot introduces an interesting blend of human-guided planning with an enhanced workflow that includes the refinement component. This hybrid approach attempts to leverage the strengths of both planning strategies (agent-based and human-based), which is a unique aspect. However, the idea of refining existing patching processes isn’t entirely groundbreaking; hybrid methods are not new in machine learning or software engineering disciplines.  **Significance:**   While the improvements in cost and stability represent a noteworthy step forward, the paper mainly builds upon existing frameworks and methodologies without introducing fundamentally new algorithms or concepts that would revolutionize the field. The enhancements proposed are iterative rather than groundbreaking innovations.  **Strengths:**   - The proposed architecture for PatchPilot efficiently addresses the shortcomings of previous models, suggesting it could have a meaningful impact in practical applications.  - The study's comprehensive experimental validation on SWE-Bench demonstrates rigor and commitment to empirical evaluation, which enhances the credibility of the findings. - Low operational cost is a significant advantage in real-world applications, increasing the method’s potential for widespread adoption. **Weaknesses:**   - The paper lacks a deeper exploration of the underlying algorithms used within the proposed components; this could hinder replication and adaptation by other researchers. - Given the iterative nature of the proposed methodology, it’s debatable how revolutionary it is compared to existing frameworks. - The evaluations could benefit from comparisons to more diverse and potentially novel methods beyond open-source ones, which may overlook emerging competitors. **Influence on the Field:**   If widely adopted, PatchPilot could lead to more efficient software patching processes, particularly for developers and organizations looking to reduce costs without sacrificing too much performance. Nevertheless, it may only marginally shift the field as it does not seem to establish a completely new theoretical foundation or approach. ### Score: 7 In summary, PatchPilot offers a solid contribution to the field of software patching by optimizing current methodologies and improving stability and cost efficiency. However, its impacts may be limited by its derivation from existing concepts rather than introducing groundbreaking advances. While it is a strong iteration, it does not fundamentally change the landscape, justifying the score of 7.

### Too Noisy To Learn: Enhancing Data Quality for Code Review C
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02757v1)
- **Authors**: Chunhua Liu, Hong Yi Lin, Patanamon Thongtanunam
- **Abstract**: Code review is an important practice in software development, yet it is time-consuming and requires substantial effort. While open-source datasets have been used to train neural models for automating code review tasks, including review comment generation, these datasets contain a significant amount of noisy comments (e.g., vague or non-actionable feedback) that persist despite cleaning methods using heuristics and machine learning approaches. Such remaining noise may lead models to generate low-quality review comments, yet removing them requires a complex semantic understanding of both code changes and natural language comments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such noise on review comment generation and propose a novel approach using large language models (LLMs) to further clean these datasets. Based on an empirical study on a large-scale code review dataset, our LLM-based approach achieves 66-85% precision in detecting valid comments. Using the predicted valid comments to fine-tune the state-of-the-art code review models (cleaned models) can generate review comments that are 13.0% - 12.4% more similar to valid human-written comments than the original models. We also find that the cleaned models can generate more informative and relevant comments than the original models. Our findings underscore the critical impact of dataset quality on the performance of review comment generation. We advocate for further research into cleaning training data to enhance the practical utility and quality of automated code review.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "Too Noisy To Learn: Enhancing Data Quality for Code Review C" addresses the significant challenge of noisy comments present in open-source datasets used for automating code review tasks. These noisy comments—such as vague or non-actionable feedback—can degrade the quality of machine-generated review comments. Traditional cleaning methods have proven inadequate in fully addressing this problem. The authors propose a novel solution utilizing large language models (LLMs) to enhance the dataset quality by effectively detecting and filtering valid comments. Their empirical study on a large-scale code review dataset demonstrates that the LLM-based approach achieves a precision of 66-85% in identifying valid comments. Moreover, when these valid comments are used to fine-tune existing state-of-the-art code review models, the performance of generated comments improves significantly, with models producing comments that are 13.0% - 12.4% more similar to human-written comments and showing increased relevance and informativeness. The findings highlight the importance of data quality in the automated code review space and call for further research into dataset cleaning methods. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance**: The paper tackles a crucial issue in software development, specifically the automation of code review tasks, which can significantly benefit from the reduction of noise in training datasets. 2. **Novel Approach**: Utilizing large language models for cleaning noisy comments represents a creative and contemporary solution, enhancing the practical application of LLMs in software engineering tasks. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides empirical evidence supporting the proposed method's effectiveness, presenting clear quantitative metrics (precision rates and improvements in model performance). **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the authors demonstrate success with a large-scale dataset, the generalizability of their findings may be limited by the specific characteristics of the dataset used. The effectiveness of their approach across various domains or other datasets is not thoroughly evaluated. 2. **Technical Depth**: The paper could benefit from deeper technical discussions regarding the specific mechanisms by which the LLM performs comment validation and how it deals with ambiguous or subjective comments. 3. **Potential Dependency on LLMs**: The reliance on large language models for data cleaning may raise concerns about the accessibility and computational resources required, especially among smaller development teams or projects. Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, specifically in improving the quality of datasets used for training automated systems. While it introduces important insights and methodologies, its limitations in scope and reliance on LLMs suggest that further exploratory studies are necessary for broader applicability. **Score: 7**   The paper demonstrates notable novelty and relevance, particularly in the context of increasing the effectiveness of automated code reviews. However, its broader impact is limited by the specificity of the empirical studies and concerns regarding dependence on advanced models, suggesting room for improvement and further exploration. Thus, a score of 7 reflects a solid contribution while acknowledging areas that could benefit from additional research and validation.

### LLM-USO: Large Language Model-based Universal Sizing Optimizer
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02764v1)
- **Authors**: Karthik Somayaji N. S, Peng Li
- **Abstract**: The design of analog circuits is a cornerstone of integrated circuit (IC) development, requiring the optimization of complex, interconnected sub-structures such as amplifiers, comparators, and buffers. Traditionally, this process relies heavily on expert human knowledge to refine design objectives by carefully tuning sub-components while accounting for their interdependencies. Existing methods, such as Bayesian Optimization (BO), offer a mathematically driven approach for efficiently navigating large design spaces. However, these methods fall short in two critical areas compared to human expertise: (i) they lack the semantic understanding of the sizing solution space and its direct correlation with design objectives before optimization, and (ii) they fail to reuse knowledge gained from optimizing similar sub-structures across different circuits. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Large Language Model-based Universal Sizing Optimizer (LLM-USO), which introduces a novel method for knowledge representation to encode circuit design knowledge in a structured text format. This representation enables the systematic reuse of optimization insights for circuits with similar sub-structures. LLM-USO employs a hybrid framework that integrates BO with large language models (LLMs) and a learning summary module. This approach serves to: (i) infuse domain-specific knowledge into the BO process and (ii) facilitate knowledge transfer across circuits, mirroring the cognitive strategies of expert designers. Specifically, LLM-USO constructs a knowledge summary mechanism to distill and apply design insights from one circuit to related ones. It also incorporates a knowledge summary critiquing mechanism to ensure the accuracy and quality of the summaries and employs BO-guided suggestion filtering to identify optimal design points efficiently.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces the Large Language Model-based Universal Sizing Optimizer (LLM-USO), a framework for optimizing the design of analog circuits like amplifiers and comparators. Traditional optimization methods, while mathematically robust, lack the semantic depth and cumulative knowledge that expert designers possess. LLM-USO seeks to address these deficiencies by integrating a structured text-based representation of circuit design knowledge with Bayesian Optimization (BO) and large language models (LLMs). The key innovations include a knowledge summary mechanism to leverage insights from previously optimized designs and a critiquing mechanism to validate the quality of these summaries. This approach not only seeks to improve the efficiency of the optimization process but also aims to replicate the cognitive strategies of experienced engineers by allowing knowledge transfer between designs with similar structures. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance Assessment:** 1. **Strengths:**    - **Integration of LLMs and BO**: The paper's innovative combination of large language models with traditional optimization techniques represents a significant step forward in the field of circuit design. This blending harnesses the natural language processing capabilities of LLMs to enhance the understanding of complex design objectives.    - **Knowledge Representation**: The structured text format for encoding design knowledge is a novel contribution that can be applicable beyond analog circuits, potentially impacting various fields where optimization of complex systems is needed.    - **Cognitive Mimicry**: By mimicking expert cognitive processes for knowledge transfer, LLM-USO provides a forward-thinking approach to design optimization, addressing a common limitation in existing methods. 2. **Weaknesses:**    - **Dataset and Validation**: The paper needs to provide a clearer description of the datasets used for training and validating the model. Without this, it's difficult to gauge the generalizability of the proposed solution.    - **Computational Efficiency**: While the integration of LLMs is promising, the added complexity may lead to computational challenges, particularly concerning processing speed and scalability, which are critical in practical applications. The overall contribution of this paper could significantly enhance current practices in analog circuit design. By providing a method that effectively combines advanced AI techniques with traditional engineering knowledge, it opens avenues for further research and application. Given the innovative approach and the potential for broad impact within the field, despite some limitations in empirical validation and computational consideration, the paper stands out as a noteworthy contribution.

### Twilight: Adaptive Attention Sparsity with Hierarchical Top-$p$ Pruning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02770v1)
- **Authors**: Chaofan Lin, Jiaming Tang, Shuo Yang, Hanshuo Wang, Tian Tang, Boyu Tian, Ion Stoica, Song Han, Mingyu Gao
- **Abstract**: Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been a hot research topic. However, current algorithms such as sparse attention or key-value (KV) cache compression tend to use a fixed budget, which presents a significant challenge during deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we find that borrowing top-$p$ sampling (nucleus sampling) to sparse attention can surprisingly achieve adaptive budgeting. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework to bring adaptive sparsity to any existing sparse attention algorithm without sacrificing their accuracy. Empirical results show that Twilight can adaptively prune at most 98% of redundant tokens, leading to $15.4\times$ acceleration in self-attention operations and $3.9\times$ acceleration in end-to-end per token latency in long context LLM decoding.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "Twilight: Adaptive Attention Sparsity with Hierarchical Top-$p$ Pruning" introduces a novel framework called Twilight aimed at improving the efficiency of long-context large language models (LLMs) through adaptive attention sparsity. The authors argue that existing methods, which typically apply a fixed budget for attention mechanisms, are not well-suited for real-world applications due to their inability to adapt to varying requirements for accuracy and efficiency. By integrating top-$p$ sampling, or nucleus sampling, into the sparse attention mechanism, Twilight can effectively achieve adaptive budgeting. The reported empirical results demonstrate that this approach can prune up to 98% of redundant tokens and significantly enhance computation speed, achieving a 15.4 times acceleration in self-attention operations and a 3.9 times reduction in end-to-end per token latency during LLM decoding. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration:** The paper successfully combines the paradigm of top-$p$ sampling with sparse attention for LLMs, showcasing a creative approach to address the inefficiencies of fixed-budget strategies. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The results presented are compelling, evidencing significant reductions in latency and improvements in operation speed, which are critical metrics for LLM performance in deployment. 3. **Broad Applicability:** The authors claim that Twilight can enhance any existing sparse attention algorithms, indicating potential for widespread application across various models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the results demonstrate impressive performance, the generalized impact across diverse LLM architectures or contexts is not thoroughly examined. The paper could benefit from broader testing and diverse datasets to substantiate claims of universal applicability. 2. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** The paper could provide a more detailed comparison with existing adaptive methods to better contextualize the advancements offered by Twilight. A clear delineation of how Twilight performs in comparison would strengthen the claims of novelty. 3. **Implementation Complexity:** The concept of adaptive attention sparsity may introduce complexities in implementation. Future work should address the practical aspects of integrating this framework into existing systems, including computational overhead alongside the reported efficiencies. **Novelty and Significance:** The paper tackles a significant barrier in the utilization of LLMs by proposing a more dynamic and efficient approach to attention mechanisms, making it a relevant contribution to the field. However, the true novelty hinges on the efficacy of integrating top-$p$ sampling within a sparse attention framework—a concept that could be explored further. ### Score: 8 The score of 8 reflects the paper's substantial contribution to LLM efficiency with the innovative Twilight framework, while acknowledging the need for further empirical validation and comprehensive comparisons with existing techniques. The work is regarded as a meaningful step towards adaptive frameworks in LLMs, but with considerable room for deeper explorations and validations, limiting its impact to some extent.

### When are Diffusion Priors Helpful in Sparse Reconstruction? A Study with Sparse-view CT
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02771v1)

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on image generation, and are gaining traction for sparse medical image reconstruction tasks. However, compared to classical reconstruction algorithms relying on simple analytical priors, diffusion models have the dangerous property of producing realistic looking results \emph{even when incorrect}, particularly with few observations. We investigate the utility of diffusion models as priors for image reconstruction by varying the number of observations and comparing their performance to classical priors (sparse and Tikhonov regularization) using pixel-based, structural, and downstream metrics. We make comparisons on low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. First, we find that classical priors are superior to diffusion priors when the number of projections is ``sufficient''. Second, we find that diffusion priors can capture a large amount of detail with very few observations, significantly outperforming classical priors. However, they fall short of capturing all details, even with many observations. Finally, we find that the performance of diffusion priors plateau after extremely few ($\approx$10-15) projections. Ultimately, our work highlights potential issues with diffusion-based sparse reconstruction and underscores the importance of further investigation, particularly in high-stakes clinical settings.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the effectiveness of diffusion models as priors in sparse medical image reconstruction, specifically within the context of low-dose chest wall computed tomography (CT) for fat mass quantification. The authors compare the performance of diffusion models against traditional reconstruction methods, including sparse and Tikhonov regularization, by varying the number of projections utilized. They identify two key findings: (1) classical methods outperform diffusion priors when a sufficient number of projections are available, but (2) diffusion priors excel with very few observations, capturing significant detail that classical methods cannot. Despite these advantages, diffusion models show limitations in adequately capturing all details as the number of observations increases, indicating a plateau in performance after approximately 10-15 projections. The paper emphasizes the need for caution in applying diffusion-based methods in clinical settings due to potential inaccuracies. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its focus on the performance comparison of diffusion models and traditional reconstruction techniques in the specific medical imaging application of low-dose CT. While the application of diffusion models in sparse reconstruction has garnered interest, this paper provides empirical evidence and critical insights into when these models may actually be beneficial or detrimental, thereby addressing a notable gap in the research. It offers quantitative comparisons across various metrics, which adds robustness to its findings.  However, the significance of the research is somewhat tempered by the limited scope, as results are derived from a single application area rather than a broader range of medical imaging scenarios. The authors could enhance their contributions by exploring the underlying mechanisms behind the observed performance differences, providing deeper insights into the conditions that favor the use of diffusion priors versus classical approaches. Furthermore, the paper prompts essential conversations about the implications of utilizing diffusion models in high-stakes clinical applications, emphasizing the necessity for accurate and reliable reconstructions in medical practice. Therefore, while the paper is innovative and timely, its applicability may be constrained until further exploration across diverse imaging contexts can be accomplished. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, highlighting important findings about diffusion models while also pointing out limitations and areas for further investigation.

- **Authors**: Songlin Xu, Hao-Ning Wen, Hongyi Pan, Dallas Dominguez, Dongyin Hu, Xinyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Student simulation supports educators to improve teaching by interacting with virtual students. However, most existing approaches ignore the modulation effects of course materials because of two challenges: the lack of datasets with granularly annotated course materials, and the limitation of existing simulation models in processing extremely long textual data. To solve the challenges, we first run a 6-week education workshop from N = 60 students to collect fine-grained data using a custom built online education system, which logs students' learning behaviors as they interact with lecture materials over time. Second, we propose a transferable iterative reflection (TIR) module that augments both prompting-based and finetuning-based large language models (LLMs) for simulating learning behaviors. Our comprehensive experiments show that TIR enables the LLMs to perform more accurate student simulation than classical deep learning models, even with limited demonstration data. Our TIR approach better captures the granular dynamism of learning performance and inter-student correlations in classrooms, paving the way towards a ''digital twin'' for online education.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Classroom Simulacra: Building Contextual Student Generative Agents in Online Education for Learning Behavioral Simulation" addresses the limitations of current student simulation models used in online education. It highlights two major challenges: the lack of annotated datasets related to course materials and the difficulty of processing long textual data in existing models. To overcome these obstacles, the authors conducted a 6-week workshop involving 60 students to gather detailed learning behavior data via a custom online system. They introduce a novel Transferable Iterative Reflection (TIR) module, which enhances the capability of large language models (LLMs) in simulating student behaviors, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning methods. The research reveals that TIR captures nuanced learning dynamics and inter-student relationships, moving toward the development of a "digital twin" model for online education. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the simulation of student behaviors in online education, as it tackles specific gaps in existing research—namely, the integration of course materials and the processing of extensive textual data. The implementation of a custom online system for data collection is a commendable approach that produces finely annotated datasets, which is a significant contribution to the field. Strengths: - The dual focus on dataset creation and enhancement of model capabilities through TIR is a robust strategy that addresses critical issues in educational simulations. - The empirical validation of TIR, proving it to be more effective than classical models with limited data, represents an important contribution to artificial intelligence applications in education. Weaknesses: - While the TIR module shows promise, the paper does not extensively compare its performance against newer state-of-the-art models, which could temper claims of superiority.  - There is limited discussion about the generalizability of the findings across different educational contexts or subject areas, which may hinder the broader applicability of the results. Overall, the potential influence of this work on the field of online education is considerable, particularly in enhancing personalized learning through improved simulations that mirror real classroom dynamics. Consequently, I assess the paper's contribution as impactful but with some limitations in its scope of application and comparison. **Score: 8**   This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with innovative methods, though with some areas for improvement in evaluation and generalizability.

### SimMark: A Robust Sentence-Level Similarity-Based Watermarking Algorithm for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02787v1)
- **Authors**: Amirhossein Dabiriaghdam, Lele Wang
- **Abstract**: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for reliable methods to detect whether a text is generated by such models. In this paper, we propose SimMark, a posthoc watermarking algorithm that makes LLMs' outputs traceable without requiring access to the model's internal logits, enabling compatibility with a wide range of LLMs, including API-only models. By leveraging the similarity of semantic sentence embeddings and rejection sampling to impose detectable statistical patterns imperceptible to humans, and employing a soft counting mechanism, SimMark achieves robustness against paraphrasing attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that SimMark sets a new benchmark for robust watermarking of LLM-generated content, surpassing prior sentence-level watermarking techniques in robustness, sampling efficiency, and applicability across diverse domains, all while preserving the text quality.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces SimMark, a posthoc watermarking algorithm designed to identify whether text is produced by large language models (LLMs). SimMark circumvents the necessity for internal model access, making it usable with various LLMs, including those available via API. It uses the similarity of semantic sentence embeddings alongside rejection sampling to create detectable but human-imperceptible statistical patterns. An innovative soft counting mechanism enhances robustness against attempts to paraphrase or otherwise alter the watermarked content. The experimental evaluation indicates that SimMark significantly outperforms existing sentence-level watermarking approaches in terms of robustness, sampling efficiency, and versatility across different applications while maintaining high text quality. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance SimMark addresses a critical challenge in the community of natural language processing and the broader implications of AI-generated content, which is the traceability of text outputs from LLMs. This paper demonstrates noteworthy advancements in watermarking techniques, specifically by focusing on posthoc applications that do not require deep model insights—an area lacking robust solutions until now.  #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The method achieves significant improvements in robustness against paraphrasing attacks, which is a common vulnerability in existing watermarking techniques. This strengthens the practicality of the approach for real-world applications. 2. **Compatibility**: The algorithm's design allows for broad applicability across diverse LLMs, including those accessed via APIs, which is crucial given the shift towards more diverse deployment scenarios of LLM technologies. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper reports experimental results that substantiate claims of improved performance, thereby grounding theoretical contributions in practical findings. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Scope Limitations**: While the paper excels in the realm of sentence-level watermarking, it does not sufficiently explore the implications when integrated into systems requiring different levels of text granularity or in conjunction with multimodal data. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: Though it sets a benchmark against previous techniques, a deeper comparative analysis with other contemporary methods could have strengthened the credibility of its claims. Specific metrics for comparison are not elaborated upon. Given these considerations, the novel contributions of SimMark, alongside its practical implications for text verification in an era dominated by LLMs, establish it as a significant advancement. Nonetheless, areas such as integration with diverse systems and robust comparative validation need further exploration. ### Score: 8 The score reflects a balance between the innovative nature of SimMark's approach, its thorough empirical validation, and some limitations in scope and comparative analysis. As a substantial contribution to the field, it warrants attention, yet there are opportunities for further depth and exploration.

- **Authors**: Ramón Calvo González, Daniele Paliotta, Matteo Pagliardini, Martin Jaggi, François Fleuret
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at the cost of high compute requirements. While recent research has shown that intermediate layers can be removed or have their order shuffled without impacting performance significantly, these findings have not been employed to reduce the computational cost of inference. We investigate several potential ways to reduce the depth of pre-trained LLMs without significantly affecting performance. Leveraging our insights, we present a novel approach that exploits this decoupling between layers by grouping some of them into pairs that can be evaluated in parallel. This modification of the computational graph -- through better parallelism -- results in an average improvement of around 1.20x on the number of tokens generated per second, without re-training nor fine-tuning, while retaining 95%-99% of the original accuracy. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach significantly improves serving efficiency while maintaining model performance, offering a practical improvement for large-scale LLM deployment.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "Leveraging the true depth of LLMs" investigates ways to enhance the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing their computational depth. It builds on previous findings that demonstrate the possibility of removing or reordering intermediate layers without significantly affecting model performance. The authors propose a novel approach that groups certain layers into pairs, which can be evaluated in parallel, thus modifying the computational graph. This technique achieves an average performance improvement of approximately 1.20 times in the number of tokens generated per second, while maintaining 95%-99% of the original model accuracy, without requiring retraining or fine-tuning. The empirical results suggest that this method enhances serving efficiency, providing a pragmatic solution for large-scale LLM deployment. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Application:** The proposed method has clear implications for enhancing serving efficiency in real-world applications of LLMs, addressing a significant bottleneck in the deployment of these models. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The approach is supported by empirical results that demonstrate a substantial improvement in throughput while maintaining high accuracy. This reinforces the credibility of the proposed method. 3. **Relevance:** Given the growing deployment of LLMs, findings that aid in reducing computational costs are of excellent relevance. This work acknowledges the previous research on layer reordering and builds upon it, pushing the boundary of current understanding. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Originality:** While the technique demonstrates a novel grouping approach, the core idea of exploring layer interactions to reduce computational costs has been explored in various forms within the literature. The contributions may not significantly advance theoretical understanding. 2. **Generalizability:** The paper does not extensively discuss the implications of its method across different LLM architectures and sizes, which could limit its applicability in a broader context. 3. **Depth of Technical Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration of why layer grouping improves parallelism and how this interacts with different model architectures. **Conclusion:** Overall, while the paper provides practical and valuable insights, its novelty is tempered by the existing body of work and the limited depth of theoretical discussion. The proposed method is promising in enhancing efficiency for real-world applications but lacks substantial theoretical advancement that would entirely warrant groundbreaking classification. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Conversational counselor agents have become essential tools for addressing the rising demand for scalable and accessible mental health support. This paper introduces CAMI, a novel automated counselor agent grounded in Motivational Interviewing (MI) -- a client-centered counseling approach designed to address ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. CAMI employs a novel STAR framework, consisting of client's state inference, motivation topic exploration, and response generation modules, leveraging large language models (LLMs). These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI principles and improving counseling outcomes for clients from diverse backgrounds. We evaluate CAMI's performance through both automated and manual evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency, client's state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall counseling success. Results show that CAMI not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods but also shows more realistic counselor-like behavior. Additionally, our ablation study underscores the critical roles of state inference and topic exploration in achieving this performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary of CAMI: A Counselor Agent Supporting Motivational Interviewing through State Inference and Topic Exploration** The paper presents CAMI, an innovative automated counseling agent designed to enhance mental health support using principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI). The CAMI system employs a STAR framework, incorporating three key elements: (1) client state inference, (2) motivation topic exploration, and (3) response generation, all utilizing large language models (LLMs). The aim is to encourage “change talk” from clients, thereby facilitating behavior change in a client-centered manner. The authors evaluate CAMI using both automated measures and manual assessments with simulated clients, focusing on its competency in MI skills, accuracy in assessing client states, effectiveness in exploring topics related to motivation, and overall counseling success. Results indicate that CAMI not only surpasses several existing methodologies but also simulates counselor-like interactions more authentically. The ablation study highlights the importance of the state inference and topic exploration components in achieving its successful outcomes. **Critical Evaluation** **Novelty:** CAMI presents a notable advancement in the application of automation in mental health counseling, integrating a theoretical framework (MI) with practical implementation through LLMs. It is significant as it contributes to both the technological and psychological aspects of counseling interventions. By addressing a practical need for scalability in mental health services, CAMI fills an important gap, especially given the increasing demand for mental health support tools. **Strengths:**  - The integration of MI principles into a conversational agent is a strong point, as it aligns the technology with an established psychological framework, ensuring relevance and applicability. - The systematic evaluation methodology provides robust insights into the agent's performance, showcasing a comprehensive approach to measuring effectiveness. - Demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques enhances the paper’s credibility and potential impact in the field. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper effectively demonstrates the effectiveness of CAMI, a discussion on the limitations of the technology (e.g., context sensitivity, emotional nuance in conversation) is not sufficiently addressed. - Although it showcases better outcomes than existing methods, it lacks a discussion on potential ethical implications or considerations regarding the use of automated agents in sensitive contexts like mental health counseling. - The reliance on simulated clients may not fully encapsulate the complexities of real-world interactions, which could lead to an overestimation of CAMI's effectiveness. **Influence:** CAMI has the potential to influence the field significantly by laying groundwork for further development and refinement of conversational agents in therapeutic applications. It could drive research into more sophisticated and responsive technologies that cater to diverse client needs in mental health. Based on the above assessment, I would assign the paper a score of 8.  **Score: 8** This score reflects strong novelty and significance while recognizing areas for improvement that could enhance the paper’s impact and consideration of practical limitations in applying such technology in real-life scenarios.

### Mol-LLM: Generalist Molecular LLM with Improved Graph Utilization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02810v1)
- **Authors**: Chanhui Lee, Yuheon Song, YongJun Jeong, Hanbum Ko, Rodrigo Hormazabal, Sehui Han, Kyunghoon Bae, Sungbin Lim, Sungwoong Kim
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have motivated the development of general LLMs for molecular tasks. While several studies have demonstrated that fine-tuned LLMs can achieve impressive benchmark performances, they are far from genuine generalist molecular LLMs due to a lack of fundamental understanding of molecular structure. Specifically, when given molecular task instructions, LLMs trained with naive next-token prediction training assign similar likelihood scores to both original and negatively corrupted molecules, revealing their lack of molecular structure understanding that is crucial for reliable and general molecular LLMs. To overcome this limitation and obtain a true generalist molecular LLM, we introduce a novel multi-modal training method based on a thorough multi-modal instruction tuning as well as a molecular structure preference optimization between chosen and rejected graphs. On various molecular benchmarks, the proposed generalist molecular LLM, called Mol-LLM, achieves state-of-the-art performances among generalist LLMs on most tasks, at the same time, surpassing or comparable to state-of-the-art specialist LLMs. Moreover, Mol-LLM also shows superior generalization performances in reaction prediction tasks, demonstrating the effect of the molecular structure understanding for generalization perspective.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces Mol-LLM, a generalist molecular Large Language Model (LLM) designed to enhance the understanding of molecular structures, which is essential for performing various molecular tasks. The authors argue that existing LLMs, despite their capabilities in benchmark tasks, fail to demonstrate a true understanding of molecular structures due to ineffective next-token prediction training. To address this shortcoming, the paper presents an innovative multi-modal training approach that combines instruction tuning with molecular structure preference optimization. Through extensive testing on molecular benchmarks, Mol-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both generalist and specialist LLMs in several tasks, and demonstrates superior generalization abilities, particularly in reaction prediction tasks. ### Critical Evaluation: The novelty of this work lies in its focus on structuring the training of an LLM around molecular understanding rather than mere task performance. The method of multi-modal instruction tuning combined with a novel optimization strategy for graph-like molecular representations represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between molecular science and LLM capabilities. This is particularly important because many molecular tasks hinge on accurate structural understanding, and the conventional training approaches have not adequately addressed this. The evaluation of Mol-LLM against both generalist and specialist models is a strong point, illustrating its broad applicability and effectiveness. The results presented in the benchmarks support the claim of achieving high performance, which adds to the credibility of the presented research. However, potential weaknesses include the comprehensiveness of the benchmarks used and whether they truly encompass the full range of challenges present in molecular tasks. If the model’s improvements are only validated against a limited set of tasks, its claims of being a true generalist may be overstated. Additionally, the paper may need to better address the practical implications of the model’s deployment in real-world scenarios, as these aspects can crucially influence the adoption of new technological advancements in this field. Moreover, discussions regarding the reproduction of the model or availability of training data for further research could strengthen its impact. While the results are promising, the long-term significance will depend on the community's ability to build upon this work. **Score: 8** The paper presents a meaningful and valuable contribution to the field of molecular LLM development. Its innovative approach and promising results warrant a high score, reflecting both the model's potential impact and areas where further exploration is needed.

### Accessible and Portable LLM Inference by Compiling Computational Graphs into SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02818v1)
- **Authors**: Wenbo Sun, Qiming Guo, Wenlu Wang, Rihan Hai
- **Abstract**: Serving large language models (LLMs) often demands specialized hardware, dedicated frameworks, and substantial development efforts, which restrict their accessibility, especially for edge devices and organizations with limited technical resources. We propose a novel compiler that translates LLM inference graphs into SQL queries, enabling relational databases, one of the most widely used and mature software systems globally, to serve as the runtime. By mapping neural operators such as matrix multiplication and attention into relational primitives like joins and aggregations, our approach leverages database capabilities, including disk-based data management and native caching. Supporting key transformer components, such as attention mechanisms and key-value caching, our system generates SQL pipelines for end-to-end LLM inference. Using the Llama3 family as a case study, we demonstrate up to 30x speedup in token generation for memory-constrained scenarios comparable to competitive CPU-based frameworks. Our work offers an accessible, portable, and efficient solution, facilitating the serving of LLMs across diverse deployment environments.

The authors introduce a compiler that converts neural network operations into relational database constructs, enabling the use of widely implemented relational databases to serve as the runtime environment for LLM inference. The system maintains compatibility with key components of transformer architectures, such as attention mechanisms, and generates SQL pipelines that allow efficient end-to-end token generation. Using the Llama3 model as a case study, the proposed solution achieves improvements of up to 30 times in token generation speed, particularly in memory-constrained scenarios, compared to existing CPU-based frameworks. This work aims to facilitate the deployment of LLMs in various environments, including those with limited resources. ### Evaluation The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field by addressing critical barriers to LLM accessibility and performance on edge devices and systems with fewer resources. Here are some key points of evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of SQL as a runtime for LLM inference is a novel idea, leveraging established database technologies to handle neural network operations, which is an underexplored area.  2. **Performance Gains:** The reported 30x performance improvement in token generation is significant, particularly in resource-constrained settings, highlighting the practical benefits of the approach. 3. **Wide Applicability:** By targeting a common and mature technology like relational databases, the solution could be adopted by a variety of organizations that may lack specialized hardware or expertise in machine learning frameworks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns:** While the approach offers speed-ups in token generation, it raises questions about how well it scales to larger models and datasets compared to more dedicated infrastructures. The study might need to address limitations related to model size or complexity. 2. **Limited Evaluation Scope:** The use of the Llama3 family as a case study may limit the generalizability of the findings. Comparative evaluation with other state-of-the-art frameworks or diverse use cases beyond memory constraints could strengthen the claims. 3. **Latency vs. Throughput Trade-offs:** The paper does not comprehensively address potential latency issues that might arise in real-time applications when using a database-oriented solution, which could impact user experience. **Potential Influence:** Should the proposed solution be validated thoroughly through additional experimental comparisons and broadened applications within the field, it has the potential to shift how LLMs are deployed, particularly in environments that prioritize cost-effectiveness and accessibility over raw speed or cutting-edge infrastructure. ### Conclusion Considering both the strengths and weaknesses, the paper provides an interesting perspective on LLM deployment, with significant implications for the accessibility of these models. However, due to concerns regarding the scalability of the solution and the limited context of the experimental validation, I would assign it a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, while also acknowledging the need for further validation and exploration to fully realize its potential impact. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02827v1)
- **Authors**: Yun Peng, Jun Wan, Yichen Li, Xiaoxue Ren
- **Abstract**: Code generation has largely improved development efficiency in the era of large language models (LLMs). With the ability to follow instructions, current LLMs can be prompted to generate code solutions given detailed descriptions in natural language. Many research efforts are being devoted to improving the correctness of LLM-generated code, and many benchmarks are proposed to evaluate the correctness comprehensively. Despite the focus on correctness, the time efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions is under-explored. Current correctness benchmarks are not suitable for time efficiency evaluation since their test cases cannot well distinguish the time efficiency of different code solutions. Besides, the current execution time measurement is not stable and comprehensive, threatening the validity of the time efficiency evaluation. To address the challenges in the time efficiency evaluation of code generation, we propose COFFE, a code generation benchmark for evaluating the time efficiency of LLM-generated code solutions. COFFE contains 398 and 358 problems for function-level and file-level code generation, respectively. To improve the distinguishability, we design a novel stressful test case generation approach with contracts and two new formats of test cases to improve the accuracy of generation. For the time evaluation metric, we propose efficienct@k based on CPU instruction count to ensure a stable and solid comparison between different solutions. We evaluate 14 popular LLMs on COFFE and identify four findings. Based on the findings, we draw some implications for LLM researchers and software practitioners to facilitate future research and usage of LLMs in code generation.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper introduces COFFE, a benchmark designed to evaluate the time efficiency of code generated by large language models (LLMs). While previous research primarily focused on the correctness of code generation, COFFE addresses a gap in the assessment of time efficiency, which has been under-explored. The benchmark includes 398 function-level and 358 file-level problems, developed using a novel test case generation approach to enhance distinguishability and the evaluation's accuracy. For measuring time efficiency, the authors present the metric "efficienct@k," based on CPU instruction counts, to allow stable comparisons between various code solutions. They tested 14 popular LLMs using COFFE, revealing four significant findings that offer insights for both LLM researchers and software practitioners regarding code generation effectiveness. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Focus**: The paper highlights an important, yet often neglected, aspect of code generation—time efficiency. This provides a fresh perspective within the domain dominated by correctness-focused benchmarks, making it a timely contribution as the use of LLMs becomes more prominent in software development. 2. **Comprehensive Testing**: The inclusion of a substantial number of problems for functional and file-level coding signifies a thorough approach to benchmarking, enhancing the robustness of COFFE as a testing tool. 3. **Innovative Metrics**: The introduction of the "efficienct@k" metric based on CPU instruction counts represents a methodological advancement, providing a more stable and objective measure for comparing the performance of various code solutions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: Although time efficiency evaluation is crucial, the benchmark could benefit from additional dimensions of performance, such as memory usage or maintainability, which are also vital in real-world applications. This could limit the benchmark’s applicability in a broader context. 2. **Potential Reliance on LLM Architects**: The findings solely based on 14 LLMs may not be widely generalizable to other models, particularly those that could emerge in the future. Without a wider sample, the conclusions could reflect biases inherent in the chosen models. 3. **Execution Environment Variability**: The paper does not extensively address how the execution environment (e.g., hardware discrepancies, software versions) could influence the time efficiency metrics, which may compromise the consistency of evaluations across different setups. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, COFFE presents a significant advancement in evaluating code generation by emphasizing time efficiency, an area often overshadowed by correctness metrics. While the presented innovations and findings are promising and can influence both research and practical applications, the benchmark's limitations in scope and potential inconsistencies in execution could mitigate its overall impact. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: In the last decade, the rapid development of deep learning (DL) has made it possible to perform automatic, accurate, and robust Change Detection (CD) on large volumes of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). However, despite advances in CD methods, their practical application in real-world contexts remains limited due to the diverse input data and the applicational context. For example, the collected RSIs can be time-series observations, and more informative results are required to indicate the time of change or the specific change category. Moreover, training a Deep Neural Network (DNN) requires a massive amount of training samples, whereas in many cases these samples are difficult to collect. To address these challenges, various specific CD methods have been developed considering different application scenarios and training resources. Additionally, recent advancements in image generation, self-supervision, and visual foundation models (VFMs) have opened up new approaches to address the 'data-hungry' issue of DL-based CD. The development of these methods in broader application scenarios requires further investigation and discussion. Therefore, this article summarizes the literature methods for different CD tasks and the available strategies and techniques to train and deploy DL-based CD methods in sample-limited scenarios. We expect that this survey can provide new insights and inspiration for researchers in this field to develop more effective CD methods that can be applied in a wider range of contexts.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper surveys the advancements and challenges in sample-efficient deep learning (DL) techniques specifically for Change Detection (CD) in Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). It discusses the potential of DL in performing CD automatically and reliably but notes that practical applications face hurdles due to the variability of input data and contexts in which RSIs are collected. The need for large training datasets poses a significant obstacle, as gathering such data can be impractical. The paper reviews various CD methods adapted to different scenarios and the emergence of innovative techniques, such as image generation and self-supervised learning, that help mitigate the data scarcity issue. Ultimately, the authors aim to inspire further research by summarizing existing strategies and techniques applicable to sample-constrained environments in CD tasks. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Timeliness and Relevance:** The paper tackles an urgent problem in the landscape of remote sensing and machine learning, as the demand for effective CD methods continues to grow with increasing availability of RSIs. 2. **Comprehensive Review:** It provides a thorough analysis of existing literature, revealing a landscape that highlights various methodologies and technological advancements in the field. This broad overview is beneficial for researchers and practitioners. 3. **Identification of Key Issues:** By articulating the challenges posed by data scarcity and the mismatch between the capabilities of deep networks and the available data, the paper addresses a critical barrier in deploying DL techniques in real-world settings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Novel Techniques:** While the paper reviews existing methods and challenges, it does not propose new methodologies or frameworks, which limits its forward-looking impact. It primarily summarizes existing works rather than introducing novel insights or innovative concepts. 2. **Potential Overemphasis on Limitations:** Although recognizing the limitations of current methodologies is pertinent, the paper may inadvertently discourage new researchers from exploring areas deemed 'challenging' without offering enough encouragement or pathways for exploration. 3. **Absence of Concrete Solutions:** While the discussion is valuable, it sometimes lapses into generalities without providing specified solutions or strategies for overcoming the identified challenges effectively. Given the synthesis of existing research and the identification of critical areas for further investigation, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the literature by raising awareness about the challenges facing the field. However, its impact is somewhat constrained by the lack of original proposals or clear pathways to advance the knowledge base. **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution that enhances understanding within a significant domain. The paper effectively synthesizes an important area of research but could benefit from integrating more novel insights or concrete solutions to bolster its significance in driving the field forward.

### OceanChat: The Effect of Virtual Conversational AI Agents on Sustainable Attitude and Behavior Change
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02863v1)
- **Authors**: Pat Pataranutaporn, Alexander Doudkin, Pattie Maes
- **Abstract**: Marine ecosystems face unprecedented threats from climate change and plastic pollution, yet traditional environmental education often struggles to translate awareness into sustained behavioral change. This paper presents OceanChat, an interactive system leveraging large language models to create conversational AI agents represented as animated marine creatures -- specifically a beluga whale, a jellyfish, and a seahorse -- designed to promote environmental behavior (PEB) and foster awareness through personalized dialogue. Through a between-subjects experiment (N=900), we compared three conditions: (1) Static Scientific Information, providing conventional environmental education through text and images; (2) Static Character Narrative, featuring first-person storytelling from 3D-rendered marine creatures; and (3) Conversational Character Narrative, enabling real-time dialogue with AI-powered marine characters. Our analysis revealed that the Conversational Character Narrative condition significantly increased behavioral intentions and sustainable choice preferences compared to static approaches. The beluga whale character demonstrated consistently stronger emotional engagement across multiple measures, including perceived anthropomorphism and empathy. However, impacts on deeper measures like climate policy support and psychological distance were limited, highlighting the complexity of shifting entrenched beliefs. Our work extends research on sustainability interfaces facilitating PEB and offers design principles for creating emotionally resonant, context-aware AI characters. By balancing anthropomorphism with species authenticity, OceanChat demonstrates how interactive narratives can bridge the gap between environmental knowledge and real-world behavior change.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper "OceanChat: The Effect of Virtual Conversational AI Agents on Sustainable Attitude and Behavior Change" addresses the challenges facing marine ecosystems due to climate change and pollution. It introduces OceanChat, an interactive system that utilizes large language models to create animated AI agents modeled after marine creatures, such as a beluga whale, jellyfish, and seahorse. These agents aim to enhance environmental education by fostering sustainable behaviors through personalized dialogue. In a study featuring 900 participants, the researchers tested three different modes of engagement: (1) traditional static information delivery through text and images, (2) first-person narratives from static marine creature models, and (3) interactive conversations with AI agents. Results showed that interaction with Conversational Character Narratives significantly improved participants' intentions to engage in environmentally friendly behavior. Notably, the beluga whale character elicited higher emotional engagement than other modalities, though overall effects on complex measures such as policy support were marginal. The paper concludes by offering design principles for effective sustainability-oriented AI interactions and emphasizes the need for balancing anthropomorphism with authenticity in character design.  **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel approach by integrating conversational AI into environmental education, distinguishing itself from traditional methods of awareness-raising that do not facilitate deep engagement or behavior change. By using animated marine creatures, the study appeals on an emotional level which is often underexplored in both environmental education and AI interaction studies.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of AI agents for interactive dialogue marks a significant departure from traditional environmental education methods, showcasing an inventive blend of technology and pedagogy. 2. **Robust Experimental Design:** The between-subjects study design with a substantial sample size (N=900) enhances the reliability of the findings. 3. **Clear Implications for Design:** The paper identifies actionable design principles that can guide the creation of effective educational AI applications, which could have broad implications across various fields. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Depth of Impact:** Although behavioral intentions were positively influenced, the study found restricted effectiveness in changing more complex beliefs such as climate policy support. This highlights a potential shortcoming in achieving meaningful change. 2. **Anthropomorphism vs. Authenticity Dilemma:** While the characters foster emotional connection, the balance between creating engaging, anthropomorphized representations and maintaining scientific authenticity could be critiqued, as audiences may question the reliability of the information conveyed. 3. **Scope of Environmental Issues:** The focus on a limited range of marine creatures may inadvertently narrow the applicability of the findings to other environmental issues not represented by the chosen agents. **Overall Impact:** The paper encourages further exploration of how AI can facilitate sustainable behaviors and emphasizes the importance of emotional engagement in educational initiatives. It presents a fresh perspective on applying conversational AI to pressing global issues and calls for future research in this intersection. Given these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. This score acknowledges the innovative approach and substantial findings while also reflecting the limitations concerning the depth of change in entrenched beliefs and the scope of its application. **Score: 7**

### A Systematic Approach for Assessing Large Language Models' Test Case Generation Capability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02866v1)
- **Authors**: Hung-Fu Chang, Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi
- **Abstract**: Software testing ensures the quality and reliability of software products, but manual test case creation is labor-intensive. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in unit test creation with LLMs. However, effective assessment of LLM-generated test cases is limited by the lack of standardized benchmarks that comprehensively cover diverse programming scenarios. To address the assessment of LLM's test case generation ability and lacking dataset for evaluation, we propose the Generated Benchmark from Control-Flow Structure and Variable Usage Composition (GBCV) approach, which systematically generates programs used for evaluating LLMs' test generation capabilities. By leveraging basic control-flow structures and variable usage, GBCV provides a flexible framework to create a spectrum of programs ranging from simple to complex. Because GPT-4o and GPT-3-Turbo are publicly accessible models, to present real-world regular user's use case, we use GBCV to assess LLM performance on them. Our findings indicate that GPT-4o performs better on complex program structures, while all models effectively detect boundary values in simple conditions but face challenges with arithmetic computations. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of LLMs in test generation, provides a benchmark framework, and suggests directions for future improvement.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a systematic framework called the Generated Benchmark from Control-Flow Structure and Variable Usage Composition (GBCV) to evaluate the test case generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Recognizing the labor-intensive nature of manual test case creation and the need for standardized assessment methods, the authors designed GBCV, which generates programs using basic control-flow structures and variable usages. This method enables testing LLMs, specifically assessing how well models like GPT-4o and GPT-3-Turbo can generate unit tests across various programming complexities. The results reveal that while GPT-4o excels at handling complex structures, all examined LLMs struggle with arithmetic computations despite successfully identifying boundary values in simpler scenarios. The study contributes a benchmark for future evaluations and outlines the strengths and limitations of LLMs in the context of automated test generation. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies predominantly in its systematic approach to benchmarking LLMs for software testing purposes. The introduction of the GBCV framework represents a significant methodological contribution to the field, as it addresses the critical gap in standardized benchmarks for evaluating test case generation capabilities of LLMs. The systematic generation of programs that vary in complexity is particularly innovative, averaging the practical utility and scalability of test generation using LLMs. Strengths of the paper include its clear identification of a relevant problem in software testing, a well-defined approach to developing a benchmarking tool, and practical application of GBCV using widely accessible models (GPT-4o and GPT-3-Turbo). The results provide valuable insights into the performance variations across models, underlining the importance of developing more advanced LLM capabilities. However, the paper also has weaknesses. For instance, while it establishes a framework, it could benefit from a broader validation with a more extensive dataset and a wider range of programming languages to enhance its general applicability. Additionally, the limited exploration of the specific challenges LLMs face with arithmetic computations could indicate an area for deeper research. Overall, the paper presents significant contributions to the intersection of artificial intelligence and software testing, laying the groundwork for future studies and improvements in LLM application for automated test case generation. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the innovative nature of the GBCV framework and its relevance to the field. However, the limitations regarding the breadth of validation and exploration of specific model weaknesses prevent it from achieving a perfect score. With further development and research, this work has significant potential to influence best practices in software testing and LLM assessments.

- **Abstract**: Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for enabling all users to comprehend sensor data and its impact on their everyday lives. However, existing systems, which typically operate in a Question Answering (QA) manner, are significantly limited in terms of the duration and complexity of sensor data they can handle. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for long-term sensor monitoring with multimodal and high-dimensional data including time series. SensorChat effectively answers both qualitative (requiring high-level reasoning) and quantitative (requiring accurate responses derived from sensor data) questions in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline that includes question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for intuitive human interactions and to guide the sensor data query process. Unlike existing multimodal LLMs, SensorChat incorporates an explicit query stage to precisely extract factual information from long-duration sensor data. We implement SensorChat and demonstrate its capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves up to 26% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in handling qualitative and open-ended questions.

### Expertized Caption Auto-Enhancement for Video-Text Retrieval
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02885v1)
- **Authors**: Junxiang Chen, Baoyao yang, Wenbin Yao
- **Abstract**: The burgeoning field of video-text retrieval has witnessed significant advancements with the advent of deep learning. However, the challenge of matching text and video persists due to inadequate textual descriptions of videos. The substantial information gap between the two modalities hinders a comprehensive understanding of videos, resulting in ambiguous retrieval results. While rewriting methods based on large language models have been proposed to broaden text expressions, carefully crafted prompts are essential to ensure the reasonableness and completeness of the rewritten texts. This paper proposes an automatic caption enhancement method that enhances expression quality and mitigates empiricism in augmented captions through self-learning. Additionally, an expertized caption selection mechanism is designed and introduced to customize augmented captions for each video, facilitating video-text matching. Our method is entirely data-driven, which not only dispenses with heavy data collection and computation workload but also improves self-adaptability by circumventing lexicon dependence and introducing personalized matching. The superiority of our method is validated by state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, specifically achieving Top-1 recall accuracy of 68.5% on MSR-VTT, 68.1% on MSVD, and 62.0% on DiDeMo.
- **Summary**: ### Paper Summary The paper titled "Expertized Caption Auto-Enhancement for Video-Text Retrieval" presents a novel approach to improve video-text retrieval by addressing a critical issue: the inadequacy of textual descriptions for videos. The authors propose an automatic framework for caption enhancement that uses self-learning to improve the quality of captions and reduce subjective discrepancies in augmented captions. A specialized caption selection mechanism is introduced, tailoring augmented captions to individual videos to improve the matching process between text and video. Their data-driven approach minimizes the need for extensive data collection while enhancing adaptability through personalized matching. The method demonstrates notable improvements in performance, achieving top recall accuracy rates on key benchmarks (MSR-VTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo), indicating its effectiveness. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance This paper brings forward a significant contribution to the video-text retrieval community, particularly in addressing the gap between video content and textual description. The proposed automatic caption enhancement method is innovative as it integrates self-learning to refine textual information, minimizing human input and bias—which is a common challenge in traditional approaches. The novel aspect of customizing augmented captions for individual videos through an expertized selection mechanism further strengthens its relevance and applicability. However, while the improvements in recall accuracy are commendable, the overall novelty may be less pronounced when considering existing methodologies that also tackle video-text retrieval, sometimes with greater emphasis on multimodal learning frameworks. Additionally, the paper could improve on providing a more detailed analysis of how the proposed method compares against contemporary techniques, as this would further substantiate its significance. Despite these critiques, the paper stands out for its application of self-learning and personalization to enhance video-text retrieval—a field where effective matching is crucial for various applications including multimedia search engines, content moderation, and accessibility tools. In conclusion, I assign a score of 8 to the paper. This reflects its notable advances in a challenging area of research, while still acknowledging that there remains space for further exploration and comparison with existing methodologies. **Score: 8**

While machine learning-based sentiment classification shows promise in this realm, its technical complexity often bars small businesses and individuals from leveraging such advancements, which may end up making the competitive gap between small and large businesses even bigger in terms of improving customer satisfaction. This paper introduces an approach that integrates large language models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models, making it accessible to a wider audience. Our experiments across various datasets confirm that our approach retains high classification accuracy without the need for manual labeling, expert knowledge in tuning and data annotation, or substantial computational power. By significantly lowering the barriers to applying sentiment classification techniques, our methodology enhances competitiveness and paves the way for making machine learning technology accessible to a broader audience.

The authors propose an innovative approach that leverages large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT and BERT, to facilitate review classification without requiring manual labeling or extensive resources. Their experiments demonstrate that this method can achieve high classification accuracy across multiple datasets, thus making machine learning technologies more accessible. This approach aims to level the playing field between small and large businesses by reducing barriers to entry in sentiment analysis. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The topic is highly relevant in today's digital landscape where customer feedback is critical for business success.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02896v1)
- **Authors**: Bradley P. Allen, Paul T. Groth
- **Abstract**: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for tasks like fact extraction in support of knowledge graph construction frequently involves computing accuracy metrics using a ground truth benchmark based on a knowledge graph (KG). These evaluations assume that errors represent factual disagreements. However, human discourse frequently features metalinguistic disagreement, where agents differ not on facts but on the meaning of the language used to express them. Given the complexity of natural language processing and generation using LLMs, we ask: do metalinguistic disagreements occur between LLMs and KGs? Based on an investigation using the T-REx knowledge alignment dataset, we hypothesize that metalinguistic disagreement does in fact occur between LLMs and KGs, with potential relevance for the practice of knowledge graph engineering. We propose a benchmark for evaluating the detection of factual and metalinguistic disagreements between LLMs and KGs. An initial proof of concept of such a benchmark is available on Github.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the challenges in evaluating large language models (LLMs) in the context of knowledge graph (KG) construction. It posits that many errors in these evaluations stem from metalinguistic disagreements—differences in the interpretation of language rather than factual inaccuracies. The authors utilize the T-REx knowledge alignment dataset to explore this hypothesis and suggest that recognizing metalinguistic disagreements can enhance knowledge graph engineering practices. They also propose a benchmark that aims to evaluate both factual and metalinguistic disagreements between LLMs and KGs, along with an initial proof of concept available on GitHub. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces the important distinction between factual inaccuracies and metalinguistic disagreements, an area that has not been thoroughly examined in existing literature on LLM evaluations. By focusing on metalinguistic aspects in the context of KGs, the authors highlight a significant gap in the current methodologies used to evaluate LLMs. This exploration is timely and relevant, given the increasing reliance on LLMs for knowledge extraction and representation tasks. **Strengths:**  1. **Innovative Approach:** The concept of metalinguistic disagreements is a novel and relevant angle that could lead to significant advancements in understanding LLM performance and enhancing their interaction with KGs. 2. **Practical Application:** The proposed benchmark could serve as a useful tool for researchers and practitioners in the field of knowledge graph engineering, encouraging them to consider linguistic nuances in their evaluations. 3. **Open Source Resource:** Providing an initial proof of concept on GitHub promotes transparency and collaboration within the research community. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Empirical Validation:** The study could benefit from more extensive empirical analysis demonstrating how metalinguistic disagreements manifest in practical scenarios. The reliance on the T-REx dataset may limit the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Potentially Overlooked Factors:** The relationship between LLMs and KGs is complex, and while metalinguistic disagreement is a significant factor, other dimensions (such as contextual or experiential differences) could also influence the outcomes and might be underexplored. 3. **Clarity and Depth of Benchmarking:** The paper could provide clearer descriptions of how the benchmark will be tested and the specific metrics that will be used, as well as how these relate to existing evaluation methods. **Influence on the Field:** If the proposed benchmark gains traction, it could lead to the development of more refined evaluation techniques that acknowledge and analyze the underlying complexities of language use in machine understanding. The recognition of metalinguistic disagreements may also prompt further research into improving the interpretability of LLM outputs within the context of KGs. Based on its innovative perspective and potential implications for advancing knowledge graph engineering practices, I assign this paper a score of **8.** It is noteworthy and relevant but could benefit from further empirical support and clarification of its methods to achieve a higher impact level in the field. **Score: 8**

### SPARC: Subspace-Aware Prompt Adaptation for Robust Continual Learning in LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02909v1)
- **Authors**: Dinithi Jayasuriya, Sina Tayebati, Davide Ettori, Ranganath Krishnan, Amit Ranjan Trivedi
- **Abstract**: We propose SPARC, a lightweight continual learning framework for large language models (LLMs) that enables efficient task adaptation through prompt tuning in a lower-dimensional space. By leveraging principal component analysis (PCA), we identify a compact subspace of the training data. Optimizing prompts in this lower-dimensional space enhances training efficiency, as it focuses updates on the most relevant features while reducing computational overhead. Furthermore, since the model's internal structure remains unaltered, the extensive knowledge gained from pretraining is fully preserved, ensuring that previously learned information is not compromised during adaptation. Our method achieves high knowledge retention in both task-incremental and domain-incremental continual learning setups while fine-tuning only 0.04% of the model's parameters. Additionally, by integrating LoRA, we enhance adaptability to computational constraints, allowing for a tradeoff between accuracy and training cost. Experiments on the SuperGLUE benchmark demonstrate that our PCA-based prompt tuning combined with LoRA maintains full knowledge retention while improving accuracy, utilizing only 1% of the model's parameters. These results establish our approach as a scalable and resource-efficient solution for continual learning in LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SPARC, a continual learning framework designed for large language models (LLMs) that utilizes subspace-aware prompt adaptation to enhance task efficiency. By employing principal component analysis (PCA), SPARC identifies a reduced dimensional space of training data, which allows for effective prompt tuning with minimal computational expense. This approach optimizes model updates on relevant features while preserving the extensive knowledge obtained during pretraining. The authors claim that their framework achieves impressive knowledge retention in both task-incremental and domain-incremental settings by adjusting only 0.04% of the model's parameters, while incorporating LoRA to adapt to various computational constraints. Experimentation on the SuperGLUE benchmark shows that the PCA-based prompt tuning coupled with LoRA can improve accuracy while maintaining knowledge retention, utilizing just 1% of the model's parameters. Overall, the proposed method positions itself as a scalable and efficient solution for continual learning in LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** The SPARC framework presents a notable contribution to the field of continual learning in LLMs, particularly due to its innovative approach of utilizing PCA for prompt adaptation in a lower-dimensional space. This novel technique appears to address the common issues associated with catastrophic forgetting in neural networks by ensuring that retained knowledge from pretraining remains intact during task adaptation. The use of a minimal percentage of a model's parameters for tuning further highlights the efficiency of the approach, making it relevant for scenarios with limited computation resources. However, while the paper claims high efficiency and knowledge retention, it lacks detailed comparisons with existing methods beyond a general reference to accuracy improvements. A more thorough benchmarking against other state-of-the-art continual learning techniques would solidify the paper’s impact. Furthermore, the integration of LoRA as a tool for managing computational constraints, while innovative, may be viewed as a supplementary approach rather than a primary contribution of SPARC.  The results on the SuperGLUE benchmark indicate potential, but the broader implications of the method in varied real-world applications remain unaddressed. The applicability of the proposed framework to diverse model architectures or different domains also requires further exploration. In summary, the paper offers a valuable enhancement to the continual learning methodologies for LLMs but falls short of providing comprehensive comparisons and detailed implications that would further establish its significance. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a positive view on the novelty and applicability of the proposed SPARC framework, acknowledging its innovative approach while also indicating areas for improvement in rigor and comprehensive assessment. The score is justified by the technical advancement it suggests and its implications for scalable models, tempered by its need for further validation within the context of comparative performance.

### Maximizing the Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Global Average Pooling
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02919v1)
- **Authors**: Wonjun Lee, Bumsub Ham, Suhyun Kim
- **Abstract**: In vision transformers, position embedding (PE) plays a crucial role in capturing the order of tokens. However, in vision transformer structures, there is a limitation in the expressiveness of PE due to the structure where position embedding is simply added to the token embedding. A layer-wise method that delivers PE to each layer and applies independent Layer Normalizations for token embedding and PE has been adopted to overcome this limitation. In this paper, we identify the conflicting result that occurs in a layer-wise structure when using the global average pooling (GAP) method instead of the class token. To overcome this problem, we propose MPVG, which maximizes the effectiveness of PE in a layer-wise structure with GAP. Specifically, we identify that PE counterbalances token embedding values at each layer in a layer-wise structure. Furthermore, we recognize that the counterbalancing role of PE is insufficient in the layer-wise structure, and we address this by maximizing the effectiveness of PE through MPVG. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PE performs a counterbalancing role and that maintaining this counterbalancing directionality significantly impacts vision transformers. As a result, the experimental results show that MPVG outperforms existing methods across vision transformers on various tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Maximizing the Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Global Average Pooling" addresses the limitations of position embedding (PE) in vision transformers, particularly its expressiveness due to its additive nature with token embedding. The authors propose a novel method named MPVG, which aims to maximize the effectiveness of PE through a layer-wise structure that incorporates global average pooling (GAP). They identify a conflict that arises when GAP is used instead of a class token, highlighting how PE serves a counterbalancing role to token values across layers. The paper argues that improving this counterbalancing significantly enhances the overall performance of vision transformers. Experimental results confirm that the MPVG method outperforms existing approaches across various tasks, underlining the importance of maintaining the directional effectiveness of position embedding. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper offers a noteworthy contribution to the field of vision transformers by addressing a recognized limitation regarding position embedding. The approach of separately normalizing token and PE during the learning process is an innovative way to enhance the expressive capability of positional information. The identification of the issue with using GAP in place of class tokens is also a critical insight, potentially affecting how future models are structured. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Insight**: The paper identifies and provides solutions for an under-explored area of vision transformers related to positional encoding, establishing its relevance in ongoing research. 2. **Comprehensive Experimentation**: The results demonstrate clear advantages of using MPVG over existing methods, which substantiates the authors’ claims. 3. **Clarity of Concept**: The proposal to maximize the effectiveness of PE is clearly articulated, laying a logical foundation that can lead to practical applications and further research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: Although the results are promising, the paper may benefit from broader experimentation across more diverse datasets or tasks to showcase the generalizability of MPVG. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could improve by providing a more in-depth comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art methods, particularly detailing scenarios where these other methods might outperform MPVG. **Potential Influence**: The paper has the potential to influence future architectures and approaches in the design of vision transformers, especially as improvements on PE are increasingly sought after to enhance model performance. **Score: 8**  The proposed method is innovative and the results are promising; however, a broader range of evaluations and deeper comparative insights would further solidify its impact on the field.

### Elucidating the Preconditioning in Consistency Distillation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02922v1)
- **Authors**: Kaiwen Zheng, Guande He, Jianfei Chen, Fan Bao, Jun Zhu
- **Abstract**: Consistency distillation is a prevalent way for accelerating diffusion models adopted in consistency (trajectory) models, in which a student model is trained to traverse backward on the probability flow (PF) ordinary differential equation (ODE) trajectory determined by the teacher model. Preconditioning is a vital technique for stabilizing consistency distillation, by linear combining the input data and the network output with pre-defined coefficients as the consistency function. It imposes the boundary condition of consistency functions without restricting the form and expressiveness of the neural network. However, previous preconditionings are hand-crafted and may be suboptimal choices. In this work, we offer the first theoretical insights into the preconditioning in consistency distillation, by elucidating its design criteria and the connection to the teacher ODE trajectory. Based on these analyses, we further propose a principled way dubbed \textit{Analytic-Precond} to analytically optimize the preconditioning according to the consistency gap (defined as the gap between the teacher denoiser and the optimal student denoiser) on a generalized teacher ODE. We demonstrate that Analytic-Precond can facilitate the learning of trajectory jumpers, enhance the alignment of the student trajectory with the teacher's, and achieve $2\times$ to $3\times$ training acceleration of consistency trajectory models in multi-step generation across various datasets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Elucidating the Preconditioning in Consistency Distillation" addresses the essential role of preconditioning in the process of consistency distillation, commonly used to accelerate diffusion models. It explains how a student model learns from the trajectories defined by a teacher model's ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and highlights the significance of preconditioning, which stabilizes this training by combining input data with network output using specific coefficients. The authors criticize prior hand-crafted preconditioning methods as potentially suboptimal and present new theoretical insights into the design of preconditioning strategies. They introduce an approach named Analytic-Precond, which aims to optimize preconditioning based on the identified consistency gap, enhancing the alignment between the student and teacher trajectories. The proposed method results in significant training acceleration—doubling to tripling the speed of consistency trajectory models on various datasets. **Evaluation:** The paper brings forth several important contributions: 1. **Theoretical Insights:** By providing a theoretical foundation regarding preconditioning in consistency distillation, it fills a gap in the understanding of how various design choices impact model training and performance. 2. **Novel Approach:** The introduction of Analytic-Precond, which allows for an analytically optimized approach to preconditioning, represents a step forward compared to traditional hand-crafted methods. 3. **Practical Implications:** Demonstrating practical advancements with substantial acceleration in training time not only illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method but also provides a clear incentive for the adoption of this research in applied settings. However, the paper's novelty may be somewhat tempered by the already existing methodologies in similar domains. While the results are promising, one could argue that further empirical evaluations on a wider variety of models or settings could enhance the robustness of the claims made. Moreover, the complexity of the proposed methods may act as a barrier to adoption among practitioners who may prefer more straightforward solutions. Overall, despite some weaknesses surrounding the breadth of evaluation and possible complexity in application, the paper makes a significant stride in the field of consistency distillation. The proposed methods are not just theoretically grounded but also practically validated, which adds to their allure. **Score: 8**

### Fast T2T: Optimization Consistency Speeds Up Diffusion-Based Training-to-Testing Solving for Combinatorial Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02941v1)
- **Authors**: Yang Li, Jinpei Guo, Runzhong Wang, Hongyuan Zha, Junchi Yan
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have recently advanced Combinatorial Optimization (CO) as a powerful backbone for neural solvers. However, their iterative sampling process requiring denoising across multiple noise levels incurs substantial overhead. We propose to learn direct mappings from different noise levels to the optimal solution for a given instance, facilitating high-quality generation with minimal shots. This is achieved through an optimization consistency training protocol, which, for a given instance, minimizes the difference among samples originating from varying generative trajectories and time steps relative to the optimal solution. The proposed model enables fast single-step solution generation while retaining the option of multi-step sampling to trade for sampling quality, which offers a more effective and efficient alternative backbone for neural solvers. In addition, within the training-to-testing (T2T) framework, to bridge the gap between training on historical instances and solving new instances, we introduce a novel consistency-based gradient search scheme during the test stage, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space learned during training. It is achieved by updating the latent solution probabilities under objective gradient guidance during the alternation of noise injection and denoising steps. We refer to this model as Fast T2T. Extensive experiments on two popular tasks, the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Maximal Independent Set (MIS), demonstrate the superiority of Fast T2T regarding both solution quality and efficiency, even outperforming LKH given limited time budgets. Notably, Fast T2T with merely one-step generation and one-step gradient search can mostly outperform the SOTA diffusion-based counterparts that require hundreds of steps, while achieving tens of times speedup.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Fast T2T: Optimization Consistency Speeds Up Diffusion-Based Training-to-Testing Solving for Combinatorial Optimization" addresses the inefficiencies of diffusion models in solving combinatorial optimization problems due to their extensive iterative sampling and denoising requirements. The authors propose a new approach, Fast T2T, which learns direct mappings from varying noise levels to optimal solutions, thereby facilitating high-quality solutions with fewer computation steps. They introduce an optimization consistency training protocol to minimize discrepancies among samples tied to different noise levels relative to the optimal solution. Fast T2T allows for both rapid single-step and multi-step solution generation, adapting to the desired efficiency and quality. During testing, it employs a novel consistency-based gradient search scheme that improves exploration of the solution space. The model shows significant improvements in solution quality and efficiency on tasks such as the Traveling Salesman Problem and Maximal Independent Set, outpacing traditional methods in time-constrained scenarios. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** Fast T2T presents a noteworthy advancement by directly linking noise levels to optimal solutions and reducing the reliance on multi-step sampling, a key limitation in existing diffusion models for combinatorial optimization. The optimization consistency training protocol is also innovative, addressing variability in generated samples and improving the robustness of the training-to-testing framework. **Significance:** The proposed method demonstrates substantial performance enhancements over existing approaches, indicating practical implications for solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems more efficiently. The empirical results suggest that Fast T2T could redefine state-of-the-art expectations in this domain by achieving competitive results with significantly reduced computational resources. **Strengths:** - The work tackles a critical bottleneck in diffusion models, demonstrating clear advantages in efficiency without sacrificing solution quality. - Robust experimental validation on well-known combinatorial problems underlines its practical applicability and scalability. - The dual-mode solution generation (single-step vs. multi-step) caters to different operational constraints, making it versatile. **Weaknesses:** - While the empirical results are promising, further exploration of the model’s performance against a broader range of combinatorial optimization problems could bolster its generalizability. - Clarity of the optimization consistency training protocol could be enhanced to assist reproducibility. - The paper might benefit from additional discussion on the theoretical underpinnings of the model to provide context and rationale for its design choices beyond empirical validation. Overall, the paper appears to fill a significant gap in the intersection of neural solvers and combinatorial optimization, potentially influencing future research and applications favorably. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s meaningful contributions to the efficiency of diffusion-based methods in combinatorial optimization and its potential to inspire further advancements in the field. The clarity and broad applicability of the findings could still be improved, which prevents it from scoring higher.

### LLM-KT: Aligning Large Language Models with Knowledge Tracing using a Plug-and-Play Instruction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02945v1)
- **Authors**: Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Qin Chen, Min Zhang, Bo Jiang, Aimin Zhou, Qinchun Bai, Liang He
- **Abstract**: The knowledge tracing (KT) problem is an extremely important topic in personalized education, which aims to predict whether students can correctly answer the next question based on their past question-answer records. Prior work on this task mainly focused on learning the sequence of behaviors based on the IDs or textual information. However, these studies usually fail to capture students' sufficient behavioral patterns without reasoning with rich world knowledge about questions. In this paper, we propose a large language models (LLMs)-based framework for KT, named \texttt{\textbf{LLM-KT}}, to integrate the strengths of LLMs and traditional sequence interaction models. For task-level alignment, we design Plug-and-Play instruction to align LLMs with KT, leveraging LLMs' rich knowledge and powerful reasoning capacity. For modality-level alignment, we design the plug-in context and sequence to integrate multiple modalities learned by traditional methods. To capture the long context of history records, we present a plug-in context to flexibly insert the compressed context embedding into LLMs using question-specific and concept-specific tokens. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-in sequence to enhance LLMs with sequence interaction behavior representation learned by traditional sequence models using a sequence adapter. Extensive experiments show that \texttt{\textbf{LLM-KT}} obtains state-of-the-art performance on four typical datasets by comparing it with approximately 20 strong baselines.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents a novel framework called LLM-KT for knowledge tracing (KT), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the prediction of students' future question-answer performance based on their prior interactions. Traditional approaches often overlook the necessity to integrate rich world knowledge and behavioral patterns that may aid in predictions. To address this, LLM-KT proposes two key alignments: task-level and modality-level. The task-level alignment uses a Plug-and-Play instruction approach to incorporate the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into KT tasks. The modality-level alignment introduces a plug-in context and sequence to facilitate the integration of multiple data modalities, enabling the model to better utilize historical interaction records. The authors conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that LLM-KT achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets, outperforming about 20 baseline models. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a critical area in personalized education, focusing on improving knowledge tracing, which can significantly impact student learning experiences. The integration of LLMs with traditional sequence models showcases innovative thinking, as it not only enhances prediction accuracy but also brings diversity to the modeling approaches in KT. The Plug-and-Play instruction mechanism is particularly noteworthy as it acknowledges the complexity of aligning knowledge with behavioral data and offers a flexible solution.  Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Novelty**: Introducing LLMs to KT represents a fresh perspective that builds on the strengths of both modern and classical approaches. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Empirical results demonstrating superior performance on multiple datasets enhance the paper's robustness. 3. **Practical Relevance**: Providing a solution with immediate implications for educational technologies is commendable. However, there are weaknesses that need consideration: 1. **Complexity**: The frameworks defined, particularly the Plug-and-Play instruction and modalities integration, might add substantial complexity, potentially limiting reproducibility and understanding. 2. **Limited Exploration of LLMs' Limitations**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion on the limitations and potential biases of LLMs in the context of educational data. Overall, while LLM-KT presents a significant advancement in knowledge tracing, its impact could be further enhanced with clearer communication of its complexities and a deeper investigation into the limitations inherent in using LLMs for this purpose. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's solid contribution to the field, showcasing innovative methodologies and yielding tangible results and improvements in knowledge tracing performance. However, the complexities introduced and the limited exploration of LLMs' limitations prevent a perfect score.

### Direct Distributional Optimization for Provable Alignment of Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02954v1)
- **Authors**: Ryotaro Kawata, Kazusato Oko, Atsushi Nitanda, Taiji Suzuki
- **Abstract**: We introduce a novel alignment method for diffusion models from distribution optimization perspectives while providing rigorous convergence guarantees. We first formulate the problem as a generic regularized loss minimization over probability distributions and directly optimize the distribution using the Dual Averaging method. Next, we enable sampling from the learned distribution by approximating its score function via Doob's $h$-transform technique. The proposed framework is supported by rigorous convergence guarantees and an end-to-end bound on the sampling error, which imply that when the original distribution's score is known accurately, the complexity of sampling from shifted distributions is independent of isoperimetric conditions. This framework is broadly applicable to general distribution optimization problems, including alignment tasks in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). We empirically validate its performance on synthetic and image datasets using the DPO objective.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a new method for aligning diffusion models by framing it as a distribution optimization problem. Using Dual Averaging, the authors optimize a regularized loss over probability distributions and enhance the ability to sample from these distributions through an approximation of the score function achieved with Doob's $h$-transform technique. The key contributions include rigorous convergence guarantees, an end-to-end error bound in sampling, and the assertion that sampling complexity does not depend on isoperimetric conditions when the original distribution's score is known. The method is versatile, finding applications in tasks such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), with empirical evaluations indicating its effectiveness on synthetic and image datasets. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**: The paper introduces a fresh perspective on alignment in diffusion models by applying distribution optimization principles, a relatively less explored area. The rigorous convergence guarantees may provide a robust foundation for further research. The use of Doob's $h$-transform represents a novel technique within this context, indicating a potential shift in methodologies used when tackling similar challenges. **Significance**: The proposed alignment method has broad implications across multiple domains, especially in optimizing human feedback processes in AI systems. The claim regarding the independence of sampling complexity from the isoperimetric conditions could change how sampling methodologies are understood and executed, which is of significant interest in the field. **Strengths**: The dual focus on theoretical guarantees and empirical validation strengthens the paper's contributions. The applications outlined suggest a practical aspect that could spur further community engagement and research. **Weaknesses**: While the theoretical results are promising, the practical implementations might encounter challenges with real-world data that are not fully considered in the empirical evaluations. Additionally, the dependence on accurate knowledge of the original distribution's score may limit applicability in scenarios where such information is difficult to ascertain. Overall, the paper holds substantive contributions and presents a methodological advancement that aligns well with current trends in distribution optimization for machine learning tasks. However, the reliance on certain assumptions may temper its immediate impact in practical applications. ### Score: 8

- **Authors**: Paul Youssef, Zhixue Zhao, Daniel Braun, Jörg Schlötterer, Christin Seifert
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) contain large amounts of facts about the world. These facts can become outdated over time, which has led to the development of knowledge editing methods (KEs) that can change specific facts in LLMs with limited side effects. This position paper argues that editing LLMs poses serious safety risks that have been largely overlooked. First, we note the fact that KEs are widely available, computationally inexpensive, highly performant, and stealthy makes them an attractive tool for malicious actors. Second, we discuss malicious use cases of KEs, showing how KEs can be easily adapted for a variety of malicious purposes. Third, we highlight vulnerabilities in the AI ecosystem that allow unrestricted uploading and downloading of updated models without verification. Fourth, we argue that a lack of social and institutional awareness exacerbates this risk, and discuss the implications for different stakeholders. We call on the community to (i) research tamper-resistant models and countermeasures against malicious model editing, and (ii) actively engage in securing the AI ecosystem.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Position: Editing Large Language Models Poses Serious Safety Risks" argues that while knowledge editing methods (KEs) are effective tools for updating the factual information in large language models (LLMs), they bring substantial safety risks that have not been sufficiently recognized. The authors emphasize several critical points: 1. **Accessibility of KEs**: KEs are easy to acquire, cost-efficient, and effective, making them appealing to malicious actors. 2. **Malicious Use Cases**: The paper demonstrates various ways in which KEs can be manipulated for harmful purposes. 3. **Systemic Vulnerabilities**: The current AI ecosystem allows for unrestricted alterations to models, raising concerns about the lack of verification in updates. 4. **Awareness**: The authors stress the insufficient awareness among social and institutional stakeholders regarding the risks associated with model editing. To address these issues, the paper calls for research into tamper-resistant models and the development of countermeasures to thwart malicious editing, as well as a collaborative effort to secure the AI ecosystem. ### Critical Evaluation of the Paper's Novelty and Significance **Strengths**: - **Relevance**: The discussion of safety risks associated with KEs is highly relevant, especially as the popularity of LLMs and their applications continues to expand. The potential for malicious exploitation is a timely and critical topic. - **Comprehensive Analysis**: The paper addresses various dimensions of the problem, including technical vulnerabilities, malicious use scenarios, and the socio-institutional implications of KEs. - **Call to Action**: By offering actionable recommendations for research and community engagement, the paper prompts a proactive approach to addressing the identified risks. **Weaknesses**: - **Lack of Empirical Evidence**: While the theoretical implications are well-argued, the paper might lack robust empirical data or case studies that demonstrate actual instances of KEs being used maliciously. This would strengthen the authenticity of the claims. - **Limited Exploration of Solutions**: Although the authors advocate for tamper-resistant models, there is little exploration of what specific strategies could be employed, leaving a gap in practical applications. - **Broader Context**: The discussion could benefit from situating KEs within a wider context of AI safety and the ethical considerations that pervade AI deployment. **Significance and Impact**: The paper addresses a crucial, under-explored area in AI safety that holds implications for the development of trustworthy AI systems. As LLMs are integrated into more aspects of society, understanding and mitigating the risks associated with knowledge editing becomes increasingly significant. The discussion encourages further research and the development of policies to safeguard against possible malicious uses. **Score**: 7 **Rationale**: The paper provides a meaningful contribution to the discourse on AI safety and LLMs by highlighting the serious risks of knowledge editing. Its strengths in relevance and comprehensive analysis are tempered by weaknesses in empirical support and depth in proposed solutions. Overall, it represents a significant call to action within the field, warranting a score of 7 for its novelty and importance.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a transformative leap in artificial intelligence, enabling the comprehension, generation, and nuanced interaction with human language on an unparalleled scale. However, LLMs are increasingly vulnerable to a range of adversarial attacks that threaten their privacy, reliability, security, and trustworthiness. These attacks can distort outputs, inject biases, leak sensitive information, or disrupt the normal functioning of LLMs, posing significant challenges across various applications. In this paper, we provide a novel comprehensive analysis of the adversarial landscape of LLMs, framed through the lens of attack objectives. By concentrating on the core goals of adversarial actors, we offer a fresh perspective that examines threats from the angles of privacy, integrity, availability, and misuse, moving beyond conventional taxonomies that focus solely on attack techniques. This objective-driven adversarial landscape not only highlights the strategic intent behind different adversarial approaches but also sheds light on the evolving nature of these threats and the effectiveness of current defenses. Our analysis aims to guide researchers and practitioners in better understanding, anticipating, and mitigating these attacks, ultimately contributing to the development of more resilient and robust LLM systems.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Large Language Model Adversarial Landscape Through the Lens of Attack Objectives" explores the vulnerabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to various adversarial attacks that compromise their privacy, integrity, and reliability. By framing the analysis through the lens of attack objectives rather than techniques, the authors provide a comprehensive examination of threats based on strategic goals: privacy, integrity, availability, and misuse. This approach emphasizes the intent behind different adversarial tactics, illuminating the dynamic nature of threats and the effectiveness of existing defenses. The aim is to equip researchers and practitioners with insights into anticipating and mitigating risks associated with LLMs, promoting the development of stronger and more resilient systems. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its shift from traditional taxonomic classifications of adversarial attacks, which typically focus on methods employed, to an objective-driven analysis. This unique perspective enhances understanding by clarifying strategic motivations, contributing significantly to the discourse on LLM vulnerabilities.

The significance of the paper is underscored by the growing importance of LLMs in various sectors, from customer service to healthcare, where security and trust are paramount. By identifying and categorizing attack motives, this work equips stakeholders with vital knowledge for improving the robustness of these models, ultimately influencing the landscape of AI safety research. However, the paper has some limitations. While it introduces a novel conceptual framework, it may lack empirical validation of the proposed insights. The effectiveness of its recommendations for mitigation strategies remains to be evaluated through further research. Additionally, the breadth of attack objectives might necessitate a more nuanced subdivision, particularly to address complex adversarial motives that may not fit neatly into the provided categories.

- **Authors**: Renjun Hu, Yi Cheng, Libin Meng, Jiaxin Xia, Yi Zong, Xing Shi, Wei Lin
- **Abstract**: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for their adoption as evaluative judges. This paper introduces Themis, a fine-tuned LLM judge that delivers sophisticated context-aware evaluations. We provide a comprehensive overview of the development pipeline for Themis, highlighting its scenario-dependent evaluation prompts and two novel methods for controlled instruction generation. These designs enable Themis to effectively distill evaluative skills from teacher models, while retaining flexibility for continuous development. We introduce two human-labeled benchmarks for meta-evaluation, demonstrating that Themis can achieve high alignment with human preferences in an economical manner. Additionally, we explore insights into the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, revealing nuances in performance and the varied effects of reference answers. Notably, we observe that pure knowledge distillation from strong LLMs, though common, does not guarantee performance improvement through scaling. We propose a mitigation strategy based on instruction-following difficulty. Furthermore, we provide practical guidelines covering data balancing, prompt customization, multi-objective training, and metric aggregation. We aim for our method and findings, along with the fine-tuning data, benchmarks, and model checkpoints, to support future research and development in this area.

These approaches allow Themis to acquire evaluative skills from teacher models while remaining adaptable for future enhancements. The authors introduce two human-labeled benchmarks for meta-evaluation, revealing that Themis can align well with human preferences efficiently. The paper discusses crucial insights into the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, including the limitations of knowledge distillation from stronger models, and suggests mitigation strategies based on the complexity of instruction following. Additionally, practical guidelines are provided for optimizing data balancing, customizing prompts, pursuing multi-objective training, and aggregating metrics. The authors aim to share their methodologies, findings, and resources to facilitate further research in the field. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**   The paper introduces several innovative aspects, such as Themis as a specialized LLM judge, scenario-dependent evaluation prompts, and two new methods for controlled instruction generation. It also highlights the dual benchmarks for meta-evaluation which could serve to standardize assessments in this domain.

### Scaling Laws for Upcycling Mixture-of-Experts Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03009v1)
- **Authors**: Seng Pei Liew, Takuya Kato, Sho Takase
- **Abstract**: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) is resource-intensive, often requiring months of training time even with high-end GPU clusters. There are two approaches of mitigating such computational demands: reusing smaller models to train larger ones (upcycling), and training computationally efficient models like mixture-of-experts (MoE). In this paper, we study the upcycling of LLMs to MoE models, of which the scaling behavior remains underexplored. Through extensive experiments, we identify empirical scaling laws that describe how performance depends on dataset size and model configuration. Particularly, we show that, while scaling these factors improves performance, there is a novel interaction term between the dense and upcycled training dataset that limits the efficiency of upcycling at large computational budgets. Based on these findings, we provide guidance to scale upcycling, and establish conditions under which upcycling outperforms from-scratch trainings within budget constraints.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the upcycling of large language models (LLMs) into mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures to address the high computational costs associated with pretraining LLMs. The authors conduct extensive experiments to develop empirical scaling laws that assess how performance varies with dataset size and model configuration. They introduce a novel interaction term between the dense and upcycled training datasets that impedes upcycling efficiency at high computational budgets. The findings offer actionable guidelines for effectively scaling upcycling efforts and outline conditions where upcycling can outperform training models from scratch, particularly in budget-constrained settings. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a timely and important challenge in the field of natural language processing: the resource intensiveness of pretraining LLMs. This effort is particularly relevant as the demand for larger, more performant models continues to grow. The exploration of upcycling small models into larger MoE models adds a layer of innovation, as the combination of model efficiency and reduced resource usage is a significant area of interest. Strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: The concept of upcycling existing models into MoE configurations presents a novel approach that could mitigate the resource constraints faced in LLM training. 2. **Empirical Findings**: The identification of scaling laws and the novel interaction term provides valuable insights and theoretical underpinnings that can guide future research and practical implementations. 3. **Practical Implications**: The guidelines for efficiently scaling upcycling efforts are likely to be beneficial for researchers and practitioners in the field, making the results applicable beyond theoretical observations. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Generalization**: While the empirical findings are significant, they may still be limited to specific architectures and training conditions, requiring further validation across a broader spectrum of models and tasks. 2. **Complexity of Interaction Term**: The introduction of the interaction term adds complexity to the model training process. The implications of this term and how best to handle it may not be fully explored in the paper, potentially leaving practitioners with challenges in application. 3. **Comparative Baselines**: The paper would benefit from a more robust comparison with state-of-the-art methods beyond just from-scratch training, particularly how upcycling compares against other cost-effective training strategies. Overall, while the paper presents insightful findings and practical guidance for upcycling models, the limitations around generalizability and interaction complexities hold back its overarching impact in the field. Nevertheless, the contributions are valuable for ongoing research into efficient LLM training strategies. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Daniil Laptev, Nikita Balagansky, Yaroslav Aksenov, Daniil Gavrilov
- **Abstract**: We introduce a new approach to systematically map features discovered by sparse autoencoder across consecutive layers of large language models, extending earlier work that examined inter-layer feature links. By using a data-free cosine similarity technique, we trace how specific features persist, transform, or first appear at each stage. This method yields granular flow graphs of feature evolution, enabling fine-grained interpretability and mechanistic insights into model computations. Crucially, we demonstrate how these cross-layer feature maps facilitate direct steering of model behavior by amplifying or suppressing chosen features, achieving targeted thematic control in text generation. Together, our findings highlight the utility of a causal, cross-layer interpretability framework that not only clarifies how features develop through forward passes but also provides new means for transparent manipulation of large language models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper, "Analyze Feature Flow to Enhance Interpretation and Steering in Language Models," presents a novel methodology for tracking and interpreting feature evolution across the layers of large language models through the use of sparse autoencoders. The authors propose a data-free cosine similarity technique to create dynamic flow graphs that illustrate how specific features change, persist, or emerge through model layers. This framework not only enhances interpretability by providing a clearer understanding of the underlying computations but also enables researchers to selectively manipulate model behavior by amplifying or suppressing specific features. Thus, the study introduces a causal interpretability framework that goes beyond mere observation, allowing for direct intervention in the text generation process. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty (Strengths):** 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The introduction of a systematic mapping of features using sparse autoencoders is a significant advancement in the interpretability realm. While there have been efforts to explore inter-layer feature connections, the proposed cosine similarity technique adds a layer of granularity that is unique.     2. **Practical Applications**: The ability to steer language model outputs by manipulating features has considerable practical implications, offering a pathway towards more controllable and user-directed text generation. **Significance (Strengths):** 1. **Cross-Layer Interpretability**: This framework addresses long-standing issues in model interpretability, making it easier for researchers to visualize and understand how layers interact and evolve features throughout the model's operation. 2. **Improvement in Model Interaction**: By facilitating targeted thematic control, this work stands to enhance the usability of language models in applications ranging from creative writing to automated response systems, which is currently crucial in many domains. **Limitations (Weaknesses):** 1. **Complexity for Implementation**: While the concept is valuable, the practical implementation of this approach might require substantial effort and could be complex, potentially limiting its immediate applicability for many practitioners in the field. 2. **Generalization Across Models**: There may be concerns about the generalizability of the findings across different architectures of language models. The paper does not extensively discuss how the methodology may apply to various model types beyond those tested. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could provide clearer metrics or benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the feature manipulation beyond qualitative descriptions. Overall, the paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of language model interpretability, with the potential to influence future research directions and practical applications. Although it possesses some limitations related to complexity and generalization, its strengths in enhancing interpretability and steering capabilities are illustrative of significant progress in understanding and manipulating large language models. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a strong contribution due to the innovative methodology and impactful applications, balanced by concerns over complexity and the need for broader validation across different model types.

- **Authors**: Mohannad Takrouri, Nicolás M. Cuadrado, Martin Takáč
- **Abstract**: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly vital for smart-grid research, yet restricted access to realistic, diverse data - often due to privacy concerns - slows progress and fuels doubts within the energy sector about adopting ML-based strategies. We propose integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in energy modeling to generate realistic, culturally sensitive, and behavior-specific data for household energy usage across diverse geographies. In this study, we employ and compare five different LLMs to systematically produce family structures, weather patterns, and daily consumption profiles for households in six distinct countries. A four-stage methodology synthesizes contextual daily data, including culturally nuanced activities, realistic weather ranges, HVAC operations, and distinct `energy signatures' that capture unique consumption footprints. Additionally, we explore an alternative strategy where external weather datasets can be directly integrated, bypassing intermediate weather modeling stages while ensuring physically consistent data inputs. The resulting dataset provides insights into how cultural, climatic, and behavioral factors converge to shape carbon emissions, offering a cost-effective avenue for scenario-based energy optimization. This approach underscores how prompt engineering, combined with knowledge distillation, can advance sustainable energy research and climate mitigation efforts. Source code is available at https://github.com/Singularity-AI-Lab/LLM-Energy-Knowledge-Distillation .

The study also explores the integration of external weather datasets directly into the modeling process, enhancing data consistency while bypassing complex intermediate steps. The comprehensive dataset produced in this study not only highlights the intersection of cultural, climatic, and behavioral influences on carbon emissions but also serves as a cost-effective resource for energy scenario optimization. The research emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering and knowledge distillation techniques in advancing sustainable energy and climate mitigation research. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: This paper presents a relatively novel approach by integrating LLMs into the field of household energy modeling. The idea of generating realistic and diverse data through these models is innovative and addresses a critical gap caused by access restrictions to meaningful datasets. By showcasing a systematic methodology across multiple distinct geographies, the paper expands the understanding of how local cultural and behavioral factors impact energy usage and carbon emissions, making it a significant contribution to the field. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Use of LLMs:** The application of LLMs for generating energy-related data is a fresh perspective that could pave the way for more data-driven approaches in the energy sector. 2. **Cultural Sensitivity:** The focus on culturally nuanced data adds depth to existing modeling frameworks, potentially resulting in more accurate energy consumption forecasts. 3. **Practical Implications:** By providing a dataset that is cost-effective and scenario-based, the research could influence policy-making and strategic energy management. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Model Quality:** The effectiveness of the proposed method largely depends on the underlying quality and biases of the LLMs used, which may introduce inaccuracies or perpetuate existing biases. 2. **Generalization Concern:** While the study covers six distinct countries, the generalizability of the findings might be limited, and additional validation in diverse contexts is needed. 3. **Implementation Challenges:** Practical deployment of the methodology in real-world settings could face hurdles, such as integration with existing energy systems and acceptance by stakeholders.

### FuXi-$α$: Scaling Recommendation Model with Feature Interaction Enhanced Transformer
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03036v1)
- **Authors**: Yufei Ye, Wei Guo, Jin Yao Chin, Hao Wang, Hong Zhu, Xi Lin, Yuyang Ye, Yong Liu, Ruiming Tang, Defu Lian, Enhong Chen
- **Abstract**: Inspired by scaling laws and large language models, research on large-scale recommendation models has gained significant attention. Recent advancements have shown that expanding sequential recommendation models to large-scale recommendation models can be an effective strategy. Current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models primarily use self-attention mechanisms for explicit feature interactions among items, while implicit interactions are managed through Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs). However, these models often inadequately integrate temporal and positional information, either by adding them to attention weights or by blending them with latent representations, which limits their expressive power. A recent model, HSTU, further reduces the focus on implicit feature interactions, constraining its performance. We propose a new model called FuXi-$\alpha$ to address these issues. This model introduces an Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention mechanism that distinctly models temporal, positional, and semantic features, along with a Multi-stage FFN to enhance implicit feature interactions. Our offline experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing models, with its performance continuously improving as the model size increases. Additionally, we conducted an online A/B test within the Huawei Music app, which showed a $4.76\%$ increase in the average number of songs played per user and a $5.10\%$ increase in the average listening duration per user. Our code has been released at https://github.com/USTC-StarTeam/FuXi-alpha.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents FuXi-$\alpha$, a novel recommendation model that addresses limitations in current sequential recommendation systems. While existing models utilize self-attention mechanisms for explicit interactions, they fall short in effectively capturing implicit feature interactions and integrating temporal and positional information. FuXi-$\alpha$ introduces an Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention mechanism that separately models temporal, positional, and semantic features, alongside a Multi-stage Feed-Forward Network (FFN) to enhance implicit interactions. Results from offline experiments indicate that FuXi-$\alpha$ consistently outperforms previous models, with performance correlating positively with model size. An online A/B test in the Huawei Music app revealed a 4.76% increase in average songs played per user and a 5.10% rise in average listening duration, suggesting real-world applicability. The authors have made their code publicly available for further research. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Mechanism:** The introduction of the Adaptive Multi-channel Self-attention mechanism is a significant contribution, aiming to better integrate temporal, positional, and semantic features than traditional models. This could lead to enhanced recommendations, which is crucial in the context of personalized user experiences.     2. **Empirical Results:** The authors provide substantial empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of FuXi-$\alpha$ by showcasing both offline tests and real-world applications via the Huawei Music app, which adds weight to the claims made. 3. **Public Availability:** The release of the code facilitates further research and application of the proposed model, encouraging reproducibility and continuation of the work by other scholars in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limitations on Novelty Claim:** While the mechanism introduced is a step forward, the paper does not clearly differentiate its contribution from existing models in terms of theoretical underpinnings or methodological novelty. The incremental nature of the improvements might suggest that these advancements were expected given the trajectory of research in recommendation systems. 2. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** The emphasis on a model's performance improving with size may raise concerns regarding overfitting, particularly in real-world applications where generalization is critical. The paper could provide more insights into how the model handles varying data distributions or user behavior dynamics over time. 3. **Scope of Results:** While the improvements in average user engagement metrics are noteworthy, the results could benefit from a deeper analysis, including a breakdown of user demographics and behaviors that might contribute to the metrics reported. 4. **Comparative Benchmarking:** More extensive comparative analyses with a broader range of current state-of-the-art models would provide a more robust validation of the proposed model’s performance. Overall, FuXi-$\alpha$ has the potential to make meaningful contributions to the recommendation systems domain, particularly regarding how user interactions with content can be enhanced through improved modeling techniques. However, the lack of significant theoretical advancement and the somewhat cautious interpretation of real-world applicability present as challenges. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, with practical implications observed in real applications; however, the model’s novelty relative to existing work and the potential for overfitting necessitate a more cautious interpretation of its impact.

- **Authors**: Junguang Jiang, Yanwen Huang, Bin Liu, Xiaoyu Kong, Ziru Xu, Han Zhu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng
- **Abstract**: In real-world recommender systems, different tasks are typically addressed using supervised learning on task-specific datasets with carefully designed model architectures. We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can function as universal recommendation learners, capable of handling multiple tasks within a unified input-output framework, eliminating the need for specialized model designs. To improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we introduce a multimodal fusion module for item representation and a sequence-in-set-out approach for efficient candidate generation. When applied to industrial-scale data, our LLM achieves competitive results with expert models elaborately designed for different recommendation tasks. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that recommendation outcomes are highly sensitive to text input, highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in optimizing industrial-scale recommender systems.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Large Language Models Are Universal Recommendation Learners" proposes that large language models (LLMs) can serve as universal learners for recommendation tasks, which traditionally rely on task-specific supervised learning and model architectures. The authors introduce a multimodal fusion module and a sequence-in-set-out method to enhance the LLM's performance in generating recommendations. Their experimental results show that the LLM performs competitively against expert-designed models when tested on large datasets. The study also emphasizes the sensitivity of the recommendation outcomes to text input, indicating the significance of prompt engineering for optimizing these systems in industrial settings. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its assertion that LLMs can effectively replace tailored models in recommendation systems, a departure from the conventional approach that relies heavily on handcrafted features and model designs for specific tasks. This universality is significant, especially considering the efficiency gains and simplification of model deployment it offers in the context of evolving AI technology. The introduction of a multimodal fusion module and a new candidate generation approach adds a technical layer of innovation, showing a thoughtful integration of methods to bolster recommendation accuracy. However, there are notable weaknesses. The performances achieved, while competitive, may not fully establish the LLMs as superior alternatives—some key tasks may still underperform compared to established models that are finely tuned for those specific contexts. The paper also appears to lack a thorough analysis of the limitations of using LLMs in recommendation scenarios, such as their scale, computational demands, and potential bias in output driven by training data characteristics.  Moreover, while the concept of prompt engineering is recognized, the paper could further explore how varying prompt strategies differ in efficacy across various recommendation tasks, which is a vital aspect of implementing these models in practical settings. Taking into account the paper's well-articulated contributions, combined with the scrutiny of its limitations, the assessment yields: Score: 7 **Rationale:** The paper presents a compelling alternative approach to recommendation systems and demonstrates effective use of LLMs. However, it only partially addresses the intricacies tied to real-world applications, and while it marks a notable advancement, the absence of comprehensive investigative depth restricts its impact. Therefore, it receives a score reflecting solid but not groundbreaking novelty within the field.

### Understanding and Enhancing the Transferability of Jailbreaking Attacks
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03052v1)
- **Authors**: Runqi Lin, Bo Han, Fengwang Li, Tongling Liu
- **Abstract**: Jailbreaking attacks can effectively manipulate open-source large language models (LLMs) to produce harmful responses. However, these attacks exhibit limited transferability, failing to disrupt proprietary LLMs consistently. To reliably identify vulnerabilities in proprietary LLMs, this work investigates the transferability of jailbreaking attacks by analysing their impact on the model's intent perception. By incorporating adversarial sequences, these attacks can redirect the source LLM's focus away from malicious-intent tokens in the original input, thereby obstructing the model's intent recognition and eliciting harmful responses. Nevertheless, these adversarial sequences fail to mislead the target LLM's intent perception, allowing the target LLM to refocus on malicious-intent tokens and abstain from responding. Our analysis further reveals the inherent distributional dependency within the generated adversarial sequences, whose effectiveness stems from overfitting the source LLM's parameters, resulting in limited transferability to target LLMs. To this end, we propose the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which uniformly disperses the model's focus across neutral-intent tokens in the original input, thus obscuring malicious-intent tokens without relying on overfitted adversarial sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiF provides an effective and efficient red-teaming evaluation for proprietary LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Understanding and Enhancing the Transferability of Jailbreaking Attacks" examines the challenges associated with jailbreaking attacks on large language models (LLMs). While these attacks can manipulate open-source models to produce harmful outputs, their effectiveness diminishes when applied to proprietary models due to limited transferability. The authors analyze the reasons behind this by investigating how these attacks affect the model's intent perception. They find that adversarial sequences designed to obscure malicious intents become ineffective on target LLMs, as the target models can more reliably recognize and ignore these intents. The study attributes the limited transferability to the overfitting of attack strategies to the source model's parameters. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose a novel approach called the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which helps obscure harmful intents by dispersing focus across neutral tokens. The results from extensive experiments suggest that PiF significantly enhances the effectiveness of red-teaming evaluations for proprietary LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several noteworthy characteristics that contribute to its significance in the field of AI safety and security. Firstly, it tackles a pressing issue—jailbreaking of LLMs—that holds substantial relevance given the rapid advancement and deployment of these technologies. By focusing on enhancing the transferability of jailbreaking attacks and presenting a novel approach (PiF), the authors address a clear gap in existing research concerning the limitations of adversarial strategies on proprietary systems. One of the core strengths of this work is its empirical basis; the authors provide extensive experimental results to validate their methodology and findings, which enhances the credibility of their claims. The introduction of the PiF method is innovative and offers a practical avenue for improving the robustness of proprietary LLMs against manipulation, contributing valuable insights for developers and researchers in AI safety. However, there are several areas where the paper could see improvement. The analysis of limited transferability primarily focuses on model intent perception but does not extensively explore other factors that could impact transferability, such as model architecture or training data diversity. A broader exploration could enrich the findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the transferability issue. Additionally, while the proposed method shows promise, its evaluation might benefit from an exploration of real-world applicability, including scalability to different LLM architectures or varying attack vectors. In terms of novelty, the introduction of PiF stands out as a significant contribution; however, the background context regarding adversarial attack methodologies is fairly established in prior literature, slightly detracting from the paper's innovative edge. Overall, the paper's contribution to the field is impactful, especially concerning practical red-teaming strategies for addressing vulnerabilities in AI models. The proposed method is relevant and timely in the context of ongoing discussions about LLM safety. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a recognition of the paper's novel approach and empirical contributions while accounting for areas that could benefit from further exploration and the background established in existing literature. The work has the potential to significantly influence practices in securing proprietary LLMs against jailbreaking attacks.

### IAO Prompting: Making Knowledge Flow Explicit in LLMs through Structured Reasoning Templates
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03080v1)
- **Authors**: Aissatou Diallo, Antonis Bikakis, Luke Dickens, Anthony Hunter, Rob Miller
- **Abstract**: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, understanding and validating their knowledge utilization remains challenging. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "IAO Prompting: Making Knowledge Flow Explicit in LLMs through Structured Reasoning Templates" proposes a novel approach to improving the transparency and effectiveness of reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors critique the existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting method, which, although beneficial in exposing intermediate reasoning, does not make the knowledge flow explicit. The proposed IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting method employs a structured template that disaggregates complex reasoning tasks into sequential steps. Each step indicates the knowledge utilized (input), the action taken, and the resultant output. This methodology allows for a clearer traceability of knowledge flow, facilitates the verification of factual consistency, and exposes any potential knowledge deficits or inaccuracies in reasoning. The authors report improved performance across various reasoning tasks using the IAO prompting technique, as well as increased transparency regarding how LLMs leverage their knowledge, complemented by positive results from human evaluations regarding verification of knowledge usage and detection of reasoning errors. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The introduction of IAO prompting marks a significant development in the understanding and application of LLMs, specifically in the realm of explicating the reasoning process. By structuring the reasoning process into input, action, and output, the authors build on existing methods and enhance them with a clear framework that emphasizes transparency in knowledge utilization. This structured approach is relatively novel and distinguishes itself from previously established methods such as CoT prompting. #### Significance The implications of this research are profound, particularly in fields where accuracy and reasoning clarity are paramount. By allowing for better verification of knowledge application and facilitating the identification of reasoning errors (or hallucinations), IAO prompting can enhance the reliability of LLMs in critical applications. This could lead to improved deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains like healthcare, law, or education. #### Strengths 1. **Structured Approach**: The IAO framework provides a clear and systematic way to analyze and interpret the reasoning of LLMs. 2. **Human Evaluation**: The incorporation of human evaluations strengthens the claims about the improvements in transparency and error detection. 3. **Broad Applicability**: The evaluation across various reasoning tasks suggests that the IAO prompting method has a wide range of applicability. #### Weaknesses 1. **Complexity in Application**: While the structured approach helps with transparency, it may increase the complexity of prompting LLMs for users unfamiliar with the format. 2. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: Although various reasoning tasks were tested, the paper would benefit from an exploration of IAO prompting across more diverse LLM architectures and domains to validate its generalizability. 3. **Measurement of Impact**: While improvements in zero-shot performance were noted, the paper could benefit from more quantitative metrics regarding how much IAO prompting surpasses CoT in specific tasks. Overall, the paper presents a novel and useful addition to the field of LLM interpretability and reasoning. Its relevance in fostering reliable applications of LLMs is substantial, though some limitations in scope and practical application remain. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong contribution to LLM transparency and reasoning, while acknowledging areas where further exploration and validation are needed to solidify its impact in diverse applications.

### Reveal the Mystery of DPO: The Connection between DPO and RL Algorithms
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03095v1)
- **Authors**: Xuerui Su, Yue Wang, Jinhua Zhu, Mingyang Yi, Feng Xu, Zhiming Ma, Yuting Liu
- **Abstract**: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) algorithms have been introduced to improve model safety and alignment with human preferences. These algorithms can be divided into two main frameworks based on whether they require an explicit reward (or value) function for training: actor-critic-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and alignment-based Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The mismatch between DPO and PPO, such as DPO's use of a classification loss driven by human-preferred data, has raised confusion about whether DPO should be classified as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. To address these ambiguities, we focus on three key aspects related to DPO, RL, and other RLHF algorithms: (1) the construction of the loss function; (2) the target distribution at which the algorithm converges; (3) the impact of key components within the loss function. Specifically, we first establish a unified framework named UDRRA connecting these algorithms based on the construction of their loss functions. Next, we uncover their target policy distributions within this framework. Finally, we investigate the critical components of DPO to understand their impact on the convergence rate. Our work provides a deeper understanding of the relationship between DPO, RL, and other RLHF algorithms, offering new insights for improving existing algorithms.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper "Reveal the Mystery of DPO: The Connection between DPO and RL Algorithms" addresses the ambiguity surrounding Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL), especially compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). With the increasing adoption of RLHF algorithms to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences, there remains confusion about DPO's classification, particularly since it does not rely on a traditional reward function. The authors propose a unified framework, UDRRA, to systematically analyze the construction of loss functions within various RLHF algorithms, including DPO and PPO. They investigate three critical components: the formulation of the loss function, the target distributions achieved by these algorithms, and the impact of specific components within the loss function on convergence rates. Their findings aim to clarify the relationship between DPO, RL, and other RLHF algorithms, enhancing understanding and potentially guiding improvements in algorithm design. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Clarification of DPO's Role**: The paper addresses a significant gap in the understanding of DPO within RL, which is essential given its increasing relevance in the development of LLMs. By focusing on the distinction between DPO and PPO, the study helps shed light on the proper classification and treatment of these algorithms. 2. **Unified Framework**: The introduction of the UDRRA framework provides a structured approach to explore the comparison between DPO and other algorithms. This can facilitate future research and lead to the development of better-aligned RLHF methods. 3. **Target Policy Distribution**: The exploration of target distributions and convergence behaviors is crucial, as this can inform model training and ultimately result in better performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Practical Implementation**: While the theoretical framework is commendable, the paper could benefit from empirical validation of its findings. Without practical implementation or case studies, the applicability of the framework remains somewhat speculative. 2. **Underexplored Components**: Although the analysis of critical components of the loss function is insightful, the discussion may not fully address how these components interact in diverse real-world scenarios or across different types of datasets. 3. **Dependence on Existing Models**: The reliance on existing models and frameworks could be critiqued for lacking a more innovative approach that extends beyond the current understanding, instead of merely clarifying existing knowledge. **Overall Significance:** The paper contributes to a clearer understanding of the relationship between different RLHF methods, particularly DPO and PPO. Its insights can inform both theoretical study and practical algorithm design, which has implications for the broader field of LLMs and safe AI development. ### Score Considering the strengths and weaknesses outlined, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. This score reflects its meaningful contributions to the understanding of DPO in the context of RLHF algorithms, but also acknowledges the need for further empirical validation and a more innovative approach to leveraging its findings. The paper is significant and can impact future developments in the RL and AI alignment field, though it falls short of being groundbreaking due to its reliance on existing concepts and lack of practical applications.  **Score: 7**

### Structured Token Retention and Computational Memory Paths in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03102v1)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Delena, Augustin Moreau, Dominic Ravensdale, Frederick Chatterton
- **Abstract**: Memory retention mechanisms play a central role in determining the efficiency of computational architectures designed for processing extended sequences. Conventional methods for token management often impose fixed retention thresholds or rely on uniform attention weight distributions, leading to inefficient memory utilization and premature information loss in extended sequence modeling. Structured Token Retention (STR) introduces a probabilistic selection framework that dynamically adjusts token persistence based on contextual significance, ensuring that computational resources are allocated to semantically relevant elements. Computational Memory Paths (CMP) extend this framework through hierarchical memory allocation, refining retention efficiency through structured reallocation of token embeddings. Comparative assessments against baseline models demonstrate that STR and CMP improve token survival rates across long input sequences while reducing cumulative error propagation across processing layers. Experimental results further indicate reductions in computational overhead, improving inference speed without degrading contextual coherence. Token distribution analyses reveal that structured memory allocation prevents excessive redundancy in attention weight calculations, optimizing information retrieval efficiency in large-scale generative architectures. The integration of STR and CMP into an open-source model illustrates the adaptability of structured memory retention methodologies, highlighting their applicability in generative text processing, long-context comprehension, and scalable sequence modeling.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents Structured Token Retention (STR) and Computational Memory Paths (CMP), innovative approaches to enhance memory retention in large language models (LLMs) for better handling of extended sequences. Traditional token management methods often lead to inefficiencies due to rigid retention thresholds or uniform attention weights, which can cause significant information loss. STR proposes a probabilistic framework that adjusts the retention of tokens based on contextual importance, while CMP builds upon this by providing a hierarchical memory allocation that optimally reallocates token embeddings based on structured criteria. The authors demonstrate through empirical assessments that these methods improve the survival rates of tokens in long sequences and reduce errors across processing layers. Moreover, they highlight improvements in inference speed and context coherence, along with a more efficient use of resources in attention calculations. The integration of these methodologies into an open-source model underscores their versatility in applications such as generative text processing and scalable sequence modeling. ### Critical Evaluation This paper presents several innovative contributions to the fields of natural language processing and architecture design for LLMs. The introduction of the STR framework is particularly notable; it moves away from conventional, static methods for memory retention and provides a probabilistic model that is adaptive to context. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the integrity and relevance of information over long sequences, a persistent challenge in the field. CMP further enhances STR by providing more structured memory management, resulting in higher retention efficiency and less error propagation. This hierarchical enhancement signifies a deeper understanding of token relationships over extended contexts, equipping future models with better data handling capabilities. The empirical results indicated in the paper are promising, showing improved retention rates and efficiency metrics compared to baseline models. However, while the novelty of these approaches is evident, there are areas that could limit the impact of the research. The paper could benefit from more extensive comparisons with a wider variety of existing models and more nuanced discussions on the limitations of STR and CMP. Additionally, scalability and potential trade-offs in multi-task scenarios or other varied language tasks remain underexplored, raising questions about the generalizability of the proposed methods. Overall, the paper provides significant contributions to improving LLM performance on extended sequences, laying foundational work for future research. It enhances our understanding of memory management mechanisms within these models and offers practical techniques for implementing these strategies effectively. **Score: 8**  ### Justification for the Score The score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to the field, particularly in enhancing memory retention in LLMs, which is crucial for processing long input sequences. The innovative design of STR and CMP, alongside empirical backing, shows a well-reasoned approach to addressing a key challenge. However, the need for further exploration of the limitations and broader applicability keeps the score from reaching the highest tier. The ideas presented have the potential to influence future research directions significantly, marked by a foundation for further exploration in structured memory algorithms.

- **Abstract**: Number-focused headline generation is a summarization task requiring both high textual quality and precise numerical accuracy, which poses a unique challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing studies in the literature focus only on either textual quality or numerical reasoning and thus are inadequate to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel chain-of-thought framework for using rationales comprising key elements of the Topic, Entities, and Numerical reasoning (TEN) in news articles to enhance the capability for LLMs to generate topic-aligned high-quality texts with precise numerical accuracy. Specifically, a teacher LLM is employed to generate TEN rationales as supervision data, which are then used to teach and fine-tune a student LLM. Our approach teaches the student LLM automatic generation of rationales with enhanced capability for numerical reasoning and topic-aligned numerical headline generation. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance in both textual quality and numerical accuracy.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper addresses the challenge of number-focused headline generation, a task requiring both high textual quality and precise numerical accuracy, which is critical for summarizing news articles involving numerical data. The authors identify that existing approaches to this problem inadequately address the dual demands of textual coherence and numerical reasoning, often focusing on one at the expense of the other. They propose a novel chain-of-thought framework that utilizes rationales based on key elements pertaining to Topic, Entities, and Numerical reasoning (TEN) to enhance Large Language Models' (LLMs) performance in generating accurate, topic-aligned headlines. The method involves a teacher LLM that generates TEN rationales, which are then used to train a student LLM, ultimately improving its output in terms of both quality and numerical precision. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms baseline models in these areas. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a significant contribution by integrating rationales that explicitly consider both textual and numerical aspects of headline generation. The combination of topic alignment and numerical reasoning into a unified framework is relatively novel, as most prior work has tended to focus on either text generation quality or numerical precision but rarely both simultaneously. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The chain-of-thought reasoning with TEN rationales proposes a meaningful advancement to LLM capabilities, thereby enhancing the understanding and use of numerical data in texts. 2. **Rigorous Experiments:** The inclusion of empirical validation illustrates the viability of the proposed approach, demonstrating clear performance improvements over existing methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While the approach is theoretically sound, the reliance on a teacher-student framework may complicate practical implementation, especially in real-time applications. 2. **Generalizability:** The research primarily focuses on news articles, and it's unclear if such a method would be as effective in diverse text categories or different contexts where numerical precision is critical. **Potential Influence:** The work is likely to influence future research on LLMs by encouraging a more integrative approach to handling textual and numerical data. It may prompt further exploration of rationales in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, enhancing both the model's utility and reliability. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's notable contribution to the field of NLP, particularly in advancing LLMs' capability for generating number-focused content. While it has some limitations, such as practical implementation challenges, its innovative framework and empirical support provide a solid foundation for future research.

- **Authors**: Xumeng Wen, Shun Zheng, Zhen Xu, Yiming Sun, Jiang Bian
- **Abstract**: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), when customized with post-training on tabular data, can acquire general tabular in-context learning (TabICL) capabilities. These models are able to transfer effectively across diverse data schemas and different task domains. However, existing LLM-based TabICL approaches are constrained to few-shot scenarios due to the sequence length limitations of LLMs, as tabular instances represented in plain text consume substantial tokens. To address this limitation and enable scalable TabICL for any data size, we propose retrieval-augmented LLMs tailored to tabular data. Our approach incorporates a customized retrieval module, combined with retrieval-guided instruction-tuning for LLMs. This enables LLMs to effectively leverage larger datasets, achieving significantly improved performance across 69 widely recognized datasets and demonstrating promising scaling behavior. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art tabular models reveal that, while LLM-based TabICL still lags behind well-tuned numeric models in overall performance, it uncovers powerful algorithms under limited contexts, enhances ensemble diversity, and excels on specific datasets. These unique properties underscore the potential of language as a universal and accessible interface for scalable tabular data learning.

Their method includes retrieval-guided instruction-tuning, allowing LLMs to effectively utilize extensive datasets and improve performance across 69 benchmark datasets. Although the LLM-based approach does not yet match the performance of well-tuned numeric models, it shows promise in specific contexts and enhances ensemble diversity. The findings suggest that language models may serve as a universal interface for scalable learning in tabular data settings. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**: The paper presents several noteworthy contributions to the field of machine learning and natural language processing, particularly in the realm of tabular data, which has traditionally been less explored in LLM research.

- **Authors**: Pengyi Li, Irina Abdullaeva, Alexander Gambashidze, Andrey Kuznetsov, Ivan Oseledets
- **Abstract**: Modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) often rely on uniform frame sampling for video understanding, but this approach frequently fails to capture critical information due to frame redundancy and variations in video content. We propose MaxInfo, a training-free method based on the maximum volume principle, which selects and retains the most representative frames from the input video. By maximizing the geometric volume formed by selected embeddings, MaxInfo ensures that the chosen frames cover the most informative regions of the embedding space, effectively reducing redundancy while preserving diversity. This method enhances the quality of input representations and improves long video comprehension performance across benchmarks. For instance, MaxInfo achieves a 3.28% improvement on LongVideoBench and a 6.4% improvement on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B. It also achieves a 3.47% improvement for LLaVA-Video-72B. The approach is simple to implement and works with existing VLLMs without the need for additional training, making it a practical and effective alternative to traditional uniform sampling methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "MaxInfo: A Training-Free Key-Frame Selection Method Using Maximum Volume for Enhanced Video Understanding" addresses the limitations of uniform frame sampling in modern Video Large Language Models (VLLMs). The authors introduce a novel method named MaxInfo, which operates on the principle of maximizing the geometric volume of selected embeddings to identify and retain the most representative frames from videos. By focusing on maximizing coverage in the embedding space, MaxInfo successfully reduces redundancy while enhancing diversity among selected frames. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through various benchmarks, showing significant performance improvements—3.28% on LongVideoBench and 6.4% on EgoSchema for LLaVA-Video-7B and 3.47% for LLaVA-Video-72B—without requiring additional training. The simplicity of implementation and compatibility with existing VLLMs make it an appealing alternative to traditional sampling methods. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The use of a maximum volume principle for key-frame selection is innovative and presents a fresh perspective on addressing redundancy in video data processing. While similar methods exist, the training-free aspect is a significant contribution, allowing for easier adoption without extensive computational costs associated with model retraining.     2. **Performance Improvements**: The reported performance gains across multiple benchmarks indicate that MaxInfo is effective. These metrics (especially the notable improvements in long video comprehension) suggest that the method addresses practical challenges faced by VLLMs in real-world applications. 3. **Ease of Implementation**: The method's ability to fit seamlessly into existing frameworks without additional training makes it a practical option for researchers and practitioners. This accessibility could lead to widespread use and further investigations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Theoretical Foundation**: While the geometric volume maximization approach is interesting, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous theoretical justification of why this method leads to improved performance over traditional techniques beyond just empirical results. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could have provided a more comprehensive comparative analysis against other existing methods and their limitations to clarify the specific advantages MaxInfo provides. 3. **Potential Overfitting**: The results presented raise questions about whether the performance improvements are due to inherent benefits of the method or if it could potentially overfit to specific aspects of the datasets used for testing, which might not generalize well across all video types. 4. **Long-term Impact**: The exploration of long video comprehension is timely, yet the paper does not sufficiently address how MaxInfo can be scaled or adapted for future video models or in tandem with advancing technologies in video understanding. ### Overall Assessment MaxInfo represents a valuable contribution to the field of video understanding by presenting an innovative, practical, and training-free key-frame selection method. Its noticeable improvements across benchmarks indicate potential for enhancing VLLM performance.

- **Authors**: Jialiang Wu, Yi Shen, Sijia Liu, Yi Tang, Sen Song, Xiaoyi Wang, Longjun Cai
- **Abstract**: Despite their impressive capacities, Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with the hallucination issue of generating inaccurate or fabricated content even when they possess correct knowledge. In this paper, we extend the exploration of the correlation between hidden-state prediction changes and output factuality into a deeper, token-wise level. Based on the insights , we propose cross-layer Entropy eNhanced Decoding (END), a decoding method that mitigates hallucinations without requiring extra training. END leverages inner probability changes across layers to individually quantify the factual knowledge required for each candidate token, and adjusts the final predicting distribution to prioritize tokens with higher factuality. Experiments on both hallucination and QA benchmarks demonstrate that END significantly enhances the truthfulness and informativeness of generated content while maintaining robust QA accuracy. Moreover, our work provides a deeper perspective on understanding the correlations between inherent knowledge and output factuality.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Improve Decoding Factuality by Token-wise Cross Layer Entropy of Large Language Models" addresses a significant challenge in the field of natural language processing, specifically the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) where the models generate incorrect or fabricated content despite having accurate knowledge. The authors investigate the relationship between changes in hidden-state predictions and the factual accuracy of outputs, delving into a more granular, token-wise level of analysis. They introduce a new decoding strategy called cross-layer Entropy eNhanced Decoding (END), which enhances the LLM's output by utilizing the probability shifts across various layers to evaluate the factual knowledge associated with each token. By adjusting the token distribution to favor those with greater factuality, END shows promising results in improving the truthfulness and informativeness of model-generated content while preserving good performance on question-answering tasks. Overall, this work extends our understanding of LLMs' knowledge utilization and output reliability. ### Rigorous Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions. First, it emphasizes a token-wise approach to analyzing LLM output, offering a novel perspective that transcends typical layer-wise analyses frequently found in literature. By introducing the concept of cross-layer entropy, the authors propose a practical and effective mechanism for improving the factuality of LLMs without necessitating additional training data or model retraining. This aspect is particularly significant given the real-world implications of LLM hallucinations, which can affect trust in AI-generated content. **Strengths:** - The proposed method, END, is innovative and grounded in a solid theoretical framework. - Empirical results indicate a marked improvement in the quality of outputs across both hallucination and QA benchmarks, suggesting practical applicability. - The exploration of the correlation between hidden states and factual output provides insights that could inform future research directions. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper articulates the benefits of END, it could provide more detailed analysis on the trade-offs in computational complexity or efficiency related to the token-wise evaluation. - The evaluation metrics, though showing improvements, should be perhaps contrasted against a broader array of models and tasks to establish generalizability. - There might be limitations in terms of the diversity of benchmark datasets used, which could influence the robustness of the findings. **Potential Influence:** The introduction of END could significantly impact how researchers develop and assess LLMs, particularly in domains where factual accuracy is critical. It reopens the conversation around utilizing internal model mechanics to enhance output quality, potentially guiding further refinements in LLM design and training methodologies. Considering the strengths of the paper in presenting a novel approach and providing empirical evidence for its efficacy, while also acknowledging some limitations in the depth of evaluations and potential constraints, I would assign a **score of 8**. This reflects a strong contribution to the field with meaningful insights, albeit with room for further exploration and validation. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03207v1)
- **Authors**: Xinyao Liao, Xianfang Zeng, Liao Wang, Gang Yu, Guosheng Lin, Chi Zhang
- **Abstract**: We propose MotionAgent, enabling fine-grained motion control for text-guided image-to-video generation. The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MotionAgent, a novel method for generating videos from text descriptions with a focus on fine-grained motion control. The core innovation is the "motion field agent," which extracts and converts motion details from text into precise object trajectories and camera movements. Specifically, it leverages an analytical optical flow composition module that fuses these representations in 3D to produce a unified optical flow. This flow is then utilized by an optical flow adapter to guide a base image-to-video diffusion model, resulting in enhanced control over video generation. The authors report significant improvements in metrics evaluating camera motion alignment in generated videos, outperforming existing models, specifically in motion generation accuracy. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** MotionAgent's approach presents a notable advancement in aligning textual descriptions with video generation, primarily through its unique motion field agent that disaggregates textual motion information into actionable components. This level of detailed control is relatively unexplored in prior research, positioning MotionAgent as a potentially influential method in the evolving landscape of generative models for multimedia, particularly video. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The concept of translating motion descriptions into specific trajectories and camera movements provides a new framework for improving video generation accuracy. 2. **Improved Metrics**: The authors demonstrate improvements in movement alignment metrics, suggesting that the MotionAgent can facilitate higher fidelity in video generation as per textual cues, a significant challenge in the field. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The use of a specific evaluation subset from VBench allows for targeted assessment of motion control, which is a critical feature of the generated content. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: The reliance on multiple interdependent components may hinder practical applications or adaptations of the method in different contexts outside the research setting. 2. **Scalability Concerns**: While the method excels in controlled environments, its scalability to real-world applications with diverse and unpredictable motion descriptors may be an open question. 3. **Limited Novelty in Broader Context**: While the motion field agent offers nuances in motion control, the overarching framework of textual-to-video generation is not entirely new. Competing frameworks with varying approaches to similar tasks exist, and more context on how MotionAgent significantly diverges or excels compared to these alternatives would enhance the paper. Overall, MotionAgent presents an inventive step forward in controlling video generation based on motion cues, potentially influencing research directions in the area of generative models. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's innovative contribution to the field, particularly in fine-grained motion control, while also considering the complexity and potential challenges in broader applicability. The balance of strengths and weaknesses argues for solid but not groundbreaking impact, justifying a high yet cautious score.

### Exploring the Security Threats of Knowledge Base Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03233v1)
- **Authors**: Bo Lin, Shangwen Wang, Liqian Chen, Xiaoguang Mao
- **Abstract**: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into software development has revolutionized the field, particularly through the use of Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) systems that enhance code generation with information from external knowledge bases. However, the security implications of RACG systems, particularly the risks posed by vulnerable code examples in the knowledge base, remain largely unexplored. This risk is particularly concerning given that public code repositories, which often serve as the sources for knowledge base collection in RACG systems, are usually accessible to anyone in the community. Malicious attackers can exploit this accessibility to inject vulnerable code into the knowledge base, making it toxic. Once these poisoned samples are retrieved and incorporated into the generated code, they can propagate security vulnerabilities into the final product. This paper presents the first comprehensive study on the security risks associated with RACG systems, focusing on how vulnerable code in the knowledge base compromises the security of generated code. We investigate the LLM-generated code security across different settings through extensive experiments using four major LLMs, two retrievers, and two poisoning scenarios. Our findings highlight the significant threat of knowledge base poisoning, where even a single poisoned code example can compromise up to 48% of generated code. Our findings provide crucial insights into vulnerability introduction in RACG systems and offer practical mitigation recommendations, thereby helping improve the security of LLM-generated code in future works.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Exploring the Security Threats of Knowledge Base Poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation" addresses the security vulnerabilities associated with Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) systems, which utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in software development. It identifies a significant threat in the form of knowledge base poisoning, where malicious actors inject vulnerable code into public repositories that serve as knowledge bases for RACG. This toxicity results in LLMs generating insecure code when they retrieve and incorporate these poisoned samples. Through extensive experimentation with four prominent LLMs and two retriever models, the study demonstrates that even a single poisoned code example can compromise nearly 48% of the generated code, highlighting the urgency of addressing these security concerns. The authors provide insights into vulnerability propagation and recommend mitigation strategies to enhance the security of LLM-generated code. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance In evaluating the novelty of the paper, it stands out for being the first comprehensive examination of the security risks linked to RACG systems, particularly focusing on knowledge base poisoning—an area that has not been rigorously explored in previous studies. The paper conceptualizes the interaction between malicious code injection and the operation of LLMs in a novel way, thus contributing new insights into the implications of using external knowledge bases in software development contexts. Strengths: 1. **Pioneering Research**: The paper addresses an emerging concern in a cutting-edge area of AI and software engineering. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: The authors support their claims with extensive experimental data, demonstrating a clear connection between knowledge base vulnerabilities and generated code security, which adds credibility to their findings. 3. **Practical Recommendations**: The focus on mitigation strategies provides tangible outcomes that can influence future research and practice in the field effectively. Weaknesses: 1. **Scope Limitations**: While the study provides compelling data, it does not explore all possible vectors of knowledge base poisoning or all types of code vulnerabilities. A broader scope could strengthen the conclusions drawn. 2. **Generalizability**: The experiments involve only a limited selection of LLMs and retrievers, which might limit the generalizability of the findings across the entire landscape of RACG systems. 3. **Focus on Code Vulnerabilities Alone**: The study may benefit from considering other security implications, such as data privacy and adversarial attacks, that could affect the overall security of RACG systems beyond just code vulnerabilities. Considering these strengths and weaknesses, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the understanding of security concerns in the rapidly evolving field of AI-enhanced code generation. It opens avenues for further research while directly addressing an urgent challenge in software development. **Score: 8**

### RiemannGFM: Learning a Graph Foundation Model from Riemannian Geometry
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03251v1)
- **Authors**: Li Sun, Zhenhao Huang, Suyang Zhou, Qiqi Wan, Hao Peng, Philip Yu
- **Abstract**: The foundation model has heralded a new era in artificial intelligence, pretraining a single model to offer cross-domain transferability on different datasets. Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "RiemannGFM: Learning a Graph Foundation Model from Riemannian Geometry" addresses the limitations of existing graph foundation models, particularly the lack of generalization in graph neural networks and their reliance on text-attributed graphs. The authors propose RiemannGFM, a universal pretraining model designed to learn the structural knowledge of graphs through a novel structural vocabulary consisting of trees and cycles. This work draws connections between graph structures and Riemannian geometry, incorporating these into a product bundle that allows the model to learn across different geometries. By stacking Riemannian layers, RiemannGFM learns structural vocabulary relevant to diverse graph types, facilitating effective cross-domain transferability. Experimental results demonstrate the model's competence across a variety of real-world graphs, indicating its potential as a significant advancement in the field. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** RiemannGFM proposes an original method to address the challenge of generalization in graph neural networks, particularly by introducing the concept of a structural vocabulary rooted in Riemannian geometry. 2. **Broad Application:** Unlike existing models that are limited to text-attributed graphs, RiemannGFM's ability to operate on diverse real graphs enhances its applicability across various domains. 3. **Solid Experimental Validation:** The paper reports extensive experiments showcasing the model's effectiveness on different types of graphs, which adds credibility to the proposed methodology. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The intricate concepts of Riemannian geometry and the model's architecture may pose challenges for practical implementation and understanding, especially for practitioners not well-versed in advanced mathematics. 2. **Limited Novelty in Context of LLMs:** While the paper makes significant contributions to the understanding of graph structures and their learning, the connection to Large Language Models (LLMs) is somewhat indirect, which may limit its perceived novelty in the broader landscape of AI and ML research. 3. **Comparative Benchmarking:** Though the paper claims effectiveness, without adequate comparisons with state-of-the-art models, it's challenging to ascertain how much better RiemannGFM performs compared to existing solutions. **Overall Significance:** RiemannGFM stands out as a noteworthy contribution to graph neural network research, advancing the dialogue on how structural knowledge can be effectively captured and generalized. The innovative use of Riemannian geometry offers a fresh perspective that might inspire further exploration in the intersection of geometry and graph-based learning. Given these points, I assign a score of 7. The paper is impactful and introduces a promising approach; however, its complexity and the need for clearer comparative analyses hinder it from reaching the highest tiers of academic contribution. **Score: 7**

### Efficient extraction of medication information from clinical notes: an evaluation in two languages
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03257v1)
- **Authors**: Thibaut Fabacher, Erik-André Sauleau, Emmanuelle Arcay, Bineta Faye, Maxime Alter, Archia Chahard, Nathan Miraillet, Adrien Coulet, Aurélie Névéol
- **Abstract**: Objective: To evaluate the accuracy, computational cost and portability of a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) method for extracting medication information from clinical narratives. Materials and Methods: We propose an original transformer-based architecture for the extraction of entities and their relations pertaining to patients' medication regimen. First, we used this approach to train and evaluate a model on French clinical notes, using a newly annotated corpus from H\^opitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg. Second, the portability of the approach was assessed by conducting an evaluation on clinical documents in English from the 2018 n2c2 shared task. Information extraction accuracy and computational cost were assessed by comparison with an available method using transformers. Results: The proposed architecture achieves on the task of relation extraction itself performance that are competitive with the state-of-the-art on both French and English (F-measures 0.82 and 0.96 vs 0.81 and 0.95), but reduce the computational cost by 10. End-to-end (Named Entity recognition and Relation Extraction) F1 performance is 0.69 and 0.82 for French and English corpus. Discussion: While an existing system developed for English notes was deployed in a French hospital setting with reasonable effort, we found that an alternative architecture offered end-to-end drug information extraction with comparable extraction performance and lower computational impact for both French and English clinical text processing, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed architecture can be used to extract medication information from clinical text with high performance and low computational cost and consequently suits with usually limited hospital IT resources
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper evaluates a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) architecture for extracting medication information from clinical narratives in both French and English. The authors introduce a transformer-based method that was first trained and evaluated using a newly annotated corpus of clinical notes in French from Hôpitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg. The method’s portability is then tested using English clinical documents from the 2018 n2c2 shared task. Results indicate that this new architecture achieves competitive performance in relation extraction (F-measures of 0.82 in French and 0.96 in English) while reducing computational costs by 10. When assessing end-to-end performance for Named Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction, the scores are 0.69 and 0.82 for French and English respectively. The findings suggest that the proposed architecture can effectively and efficiently extract medication information from clinical texts, making it suitable for settings with limited computational resources. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The introduction of a new transformer-based architecture for the extraction of medication information is a notable contribution given the existing density of methods in the field of NLP for healthcare. The dual language focus offers additional relevance, particularly in multilingual healthcare environments. However, while the approach itself may be innovative, the underlying technology (transformers) is a well-established framework widely used in NLP tasks. **Significance:** The paper’s significance lies in its practical implications for clinical settings. The emphasis on reducing computational costs without sacrificing accuracy addresses a crucial barrier that many healthcare facilities face when implementing NLP technology. This makes the findings particularly relevant to hospitals that may lack extensive IT resources. **Strengths:** - The use of a newly annotated corpus for training enhances the reliability of the model’s evaluation. - Competitive performance scores indicate that the proposed architecture does not compromise on effectiveness while providing efficiency. - The comparative analysis with a pre-existing method grants credibility to the results. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper claims a reduction in computational costs, it does not provide detailed metrics or scenarios demonstrating how this reduction translates in different hospital contexts, which could diminish the practicality of the findings. - Limited exploration of the model’s generalizability outside the tested corpora raises questions about its application in broader, more diverse clinical environments. - The result presentation could benefit from further statistical analysis or validation to substantiate the claims of performance improvements. **Potential Influence:** This research could influence future developments in NLP applications for healthcare information extraction by providing a reliable and less resource-intensive alternative for institutions needing to leverage clinical narratives effectively. However, the ultimate impact will depend on subsequent studies that replicate these findings and explore the model's adaptability across varied datasets. **Conclusion:** The paper shows a valuable contribution, particularly concerning practice in healthcare settings, but presents limitations regarding the depth of analysis and broader applicability. Overall, while the novel architecture holds promise, its potential must be supported by further research and application in diverse clinical contexts. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Seamus Somerstep, Felipe Maia Polo, Allysson Flavio Melo de Oliveira, Prattyush Mangal, Mírian Silva, Onkar Bhardwaj, Mikhail Yurochkin, Subha Maity
- **Abstract**: With the rapid growth in the number of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a recent interest in LLM routing, or directing queries to the cheapest LLM that can deliver a suitable response. Following this line of work, we introduce CARROT, a Cost AwaRe Rate Optimal rouTer that can select models based on any desired trade-off between performance and cost. Given a query, CARROT selects a model based on estimates of models' cost and performance. Its simplicity lends CARROT computational efficiency, while our theoretical analysis demonstrates minimax rate-optimality in its routing performance. Alongside CARROT, we also introduce the Smart Price-aware Routing (SPROUT) dataset to facilitate routing on a wide spectrum of queries with the latest state-of-the-art LLMs. Using SPROUT and prior benchmarks such as Routerbench and open-LLM-leaderboard-v2 we empirically validate CARROT's performance against several alternative routers.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents CARROT, a novel routing system designed to optimize the selection of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on their cost and performance. As the demand for LLMs has surged, CARROT aims to enable efficient model selection for cost-effectiveness without significantly compromising response quality. It achieves this through a mechanism that evaluates the trade-offs between performance (quality of response) and cost (computational resources). The paper supports its findings with theoretical analyses that claim minimax rate-optimality in routing, underlining the robustness of its approach. Furthermore, the authors introduce the Smart Price-aware Routing (SPROUT) dataset, which serves as a resource for benchmarking CARROT against existing routing systems like Routerbench. Empirical results demonstrate CARROT's competitive edge over alternative routers in practical applications. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of CARROT lies primarily in its ability to balance cost and performance in LLM routing effectively. While the concept of routing queries to LLMs based on cost is not entirely new, CARROT's contribution is significant in its implementation of a simple yet effective method that maintains computational efficiency. The introduction of the SPROUT dataset adds another layer of value, providing essential resources for future research and comparative testing. However, the paper has some limitations. The theoretical claims regarding minimax rate-optimality need to be scrutinized further, as the practical implications of this metric may not translate seamlessly into real-world applications. Additionally, while the empirical validation demonstrates CARROT's performance, it would benefit from broader comparisons across more diverse LLM architectures and workloads, as the range of queries tested might not fully capture the complexity of real-world applications. In terms of significance, the impact of CARROT on efficient LLM usage could be substantial, especially in applications where operational costs are a major concern. It addresses a practical need in the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM technology, which is increasingly being deployed across various industries. In conclusion, while CARROT provides an interesting and useful approach to routing within the context of LLMs, its novelty is somewhat tempered by the existing literature. Nevertheless, its practical applications and the introduction of the SPROUT dataset position it as a meaningful contribution to the field. Score: 7

### Token Assorted: Mixing Latent and Text Tokens for Improved Language Model Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03275v1)
- **Authors**: DiJia Su, Hanlin Zhu, Yingchen Xu, Jiantao Jiao, Yuandong Tian, Qinqing Zheng
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "Token Assorted: Mixing Latent and Text Tokens for Improved Language Model Reasoning" presents a novel approach to enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by leveraging a hybrid token representation. The authors identify a challenge in existing chain-of-thought (CoT) training methods, which often produce long input sequences that prioritize textual coherence over critical reasoning. To address this, they propose using latent discrete tokens, generated from a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), which allows for a more concise representation of reasoning steps. The research explores two main scenarios: training a model from scratch for a specific maze-solving challenge, and fine-tuning LLMs to include these latent tokens in tasks involving logical and mathematical reasoning. The methodology incorporates a training procedure that mixes latent and text tokens, leading to better adaptability and performance on various benchmarks. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid approach consistently surpasses baseline methods. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**: The paper introduces a hybrid representation that combines latent tokens with traditional text tokens. This concept of mixing token types for reasoning is relatively innovative in the context of enhancing LLM functionalities and addresses a noted inefficiency in current CoT methodologies. However, the overall idea of using latent representations isn't fundamentally new in the AI field, as various forms of latent representations have been explored in different contexts. **Significance**: The proposed approach could potentially lead to reductions in computational resource usage while improving reasoning performance in LLMs, which is significant given the growing concerns over the scalability of such models. The practical implications could affect how large models are trained and deployed, especially for tasks requiring efficient reasoning. **Strengths**:  - The proposed method effectively reduces the length of input sequences without sacrificing reasoning quality, addressing an important limitation of existing LLM training approaches. - The mixing training procedure offers flexibility and adaptability which could enhance model training environments. **Weaknesses**:  - Experimental evaluation may lack diversity in benchmarks; if primarily focused on specific tasks, the generalizability of the approach to other forms of reasoning remains uncertain. - The methodology and results may need more rigorous statistical validation in diverse contexts to strengthen claims of superiority over baseline models. **Potential Influence**: While the paper's contribution is noteworthy, its impact could be limited if subsequent research does not extend these findings to a wider array of tasks or real-world applications. Nevertheless, it opens avenues for further exploration of hybrid representation in LLMs. Taking into account the paper's novelty, established contributions, and potential limitations, I would assign it a score of **7**. This reflects a solid advancement in the field with practical implications; however, the foundational concepts and need for broader validation prevent it from being rated as groundbreaking. **Score**: 7

### SymAgent: A Neural-Symbolic Self-Learning Agent Framework for Complex Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03283v1)
- **Authors**: Ben Liu, Jihai Zhang, Fangquan Lin, Cheng Yang, Min Peng, Wotao Yin
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements have highlighted that Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations when solving complex reasoning problems, leading to erroneous results. To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SymAgent, a neural-symbolic framework designed to enhance complex reasoning capabilities by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Existing methods suffer from two main limitations: they often disregard KG incompleteness and treat KGs as static databases without leveraging their logical structures. SymAgent addresses these issues by conceptualizing KGs as dynamic environments, allowing them to actively engage in a multi-step reasoning process. The framework includes two core components: an Agent-Planner, which uses LLMs for extracting symbolic rules and efficient question decomposition, and an Agent-Executor, which autonomously gathers information from KGs and external sources to mitigate completeness issues. The self-learning aspect of SymAgent enables continuous improvement through exploration and iterative updates. Experiments show that SymAgent outperforms or matches strong baselines even with weaker LLMs. The framework's capability to identify missing triples also permits automatic updates to KGs. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the SymAgent framework lies in its integration of dynamic reasoning and self-learning within a neural-symbolic architecture, differentiating it from existing approaches that treat KGs statically and fail to account for their incompleteness. This conceptual shift represents a significant step forward in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, which is vital given the challenges associated with hallucinations in LLM outputs. Strengths of the paper include its innovative approach to treating KGs as dynamic entities, the effective use of LLMs to extract symbolic rules, and the implementation of a self-learning mechanism that enables continuous improvement. The empirical results demonstrating performance improvements over established baselines add credibility to the framework. However, there are some limitations. The performance comparisons might not cover all relevant models or approaches, potentially underestimating the competitiveness of alternative methodologies. The paper could also benefit from more extensive discussions on the scalability of the proposed framework and its applicability in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the authors do not extensively discuss the limitations of their approach or the potential risks associated with relying on KGs and self-learning methods. Given these strengths and weaknesses, as well as the reasonable potential for SymAgent to influence future research in neural-symbolic reasoning and knowledge graph applications, I would assign a score of **8**. This reflects a substantial contribution to the field, with room for further exploration and refinement in subsequent research. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: While increasing patients' access to medical documents improves medical care, this benefit is limited by varying health literacy levels and complex medical terminology. Large language models (LLMs) offer solutions by simplifying medical information. However, evaluating LLMs for safe and patient-friendly text generation is difficult due to the lack of standardized evaluation resources. To fill this gap, we developed MeDiSumQA. MeDiSumQA is a dataset created from MIMIC-IV discharge summaries through an automated pipeline combining LLM-based question-answer generation with manual quality checks. We use this dataset to evaluate various LLMs on patient-oriented question-answering. Our findings reveal that general-purpose LLMs frequently surpass biomedical-adapted models, while automated metrics correlate with human judgment. By releasing MeDiSumQA on PhysioNet, we aim to advance the development of LLMs to enhance patient understanding and ultimately improve care outcomes.

### Harmony in Divergence: Towards Fast, Accurate, and Memory-efficient Zeroth-order LLM Fine-tuning

- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose \textbf{Di}vergence-driven \textbf{Z}eroth-\textbf{O}rder (\textbf{DiZO}) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Harmony in Divergence: Towards Fast, Accurate, and Memory-efficient Zeroth-order LLM Fine-tuning" addresses the limitations of traditional first-order (FO) fine-tuning methods for large language models (LLMs), focusing on memory constraints that hinder practical application. It emphasizes zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a viable memory-efficient alternative, but notes its shortcomings in convergence speed and accuracy compared to FO methods. The authors present a new approach called Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization, which leverages layer-wise divergence analysis to enhance the effectiveness of ZO optimization by tailoring updates to the specific needs of each layer. The study reports substantial reductions in training time—up to 48%—while achieving competitive or superior performance compared to existing ZO methods and even some FO approaches on various tasks involving models like RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The contribution of this paper is noteworthy for several reasons: 1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of divergence-driven adaptation in a zeroth-order framework represents a novel strategy to improve LLM training efficiency. By addressing the inherent limitations of ZO methods, the paper proposes a method that attempts to retain the advantages of FO methods in a resource-efficient manner. 2. **Practical Implications:** The ability to fine-tune LLMs with significantly lower memory overhead while maintaining performance is crucial for wider deployment in resource-limited environments, enhancing accessibility to advanced NLP capabilities. 3. **Empirical Results:** The authors provide robust empirical results, showing that DiZO outperforms standard ZO approaches and rivals FO methods under various conditions, which reinforces the validity and relevance of their findings. However, there are some weaknesses: 1. **Scope of Optimization Techniques:** While the focus on ZO optimization is valuable, the paper might benefit from a more extensive comparison with alternative optimization methods beyond just FO and baseline ZO approaches, to comprehensively demonstrate DiZO's strengths. 2. **Generalizability:** It is unclear how well DiZO would perform across a broader range of tasks and models not included in their experimental setup. Further validation outside the tested environments would enhance confidence in its applicability. 3. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed approach introduces additional complexity in implementation, which could deter researchers and practitioners accustomed to the simplicity of traditional ZO methods. Considering these aspects, the paper shows significant promise and addresses a pertinent issue in LLM training, thus making a meaningful contribution to the field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the innovative methodology, strong empirical evidence, and practical implications while also acknowledging areas for improvement, particularly in the comprehensiveness of the experimental comparisons and the potential challenges of implementation.

### Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03307v1)
- **Authors**: Yu Wang, Lei Sang, Yi Zhang, Yiwen Zhang
- **Abstract**: Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines. The implementation is available at https://github.com/wangyu0627/IRLLRec.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation" discusses a novel approach to intent-based recommendation systems, which are essential for uncovering users' fine-grained preferences. The authors argue that existing methods for defining intent often fail to use available textual information, such as user reviews and item descriptions, which can help address the sparsity of interaction data. They highlight two main challenges: aligning multimodal intents while managing noise and matching latent intents across different modalities. To address these challenges, they introduce a model-agnostic framework called Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec) that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents. The framework uses a dual-tower architecture for intent representation, employs pairwise and translation alignment to manage modal discrepancies, and incorporates momentum distillation for effective teacher-student learning on intent representations. Empirical results on three datasets demonstrate that IRLLRec outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing recommendation systems. The code for the implementation is made available online. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The originality of this paper lies in its attempt to merge intents derived from various modalities (textual data and interaction data) using a large language model framework, addressing a gap in traditional intent-based recommendation systems. While the application of LLMs is becoming common, the specific use of a dual-tower architecture, alignment methodologies, and momentum distillation to harmonize multimodal representations and combat noise is a relatively novel contribution. **Significance:** The significance of the research is notable, especially concerning the growing importance of interpretability in recommendation systems. By focusing on user intent and improving the robustness and accuracy of recommendations through enhanced representation learning, this research could influence future developments in the field. LLMs are becoming central to many machine learning domains, and their application in recommender systems could lead to more personalized and accurate recommendations. **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The integration of linguistic models with traditional recommendation techniques shows an attractive interdisciplinary research approach. 2. **Robust Evaluation:** The empirical validation across multiple datasets adds credibility to the findings. 3. **Open Source Contribution:** Providing accessible code enhances reproducibility and encourages further research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** The model's complexity may pose challenges in practical implementations, as dual-tower architectures and detailed alignment strategies could be resource-intensive. 2. **Scalability:** While performance is demonstrated on specific datasets, scalability to larger and more dynamic datasets remains uncertain. 3. **Context of Textual Data:** The paper does not fully address the intricacies of the textual data usage and how it could be contextually analyzed to improve intent understanding. **Final Consideration:** The paper presents a significant step forward in understanding user intent in recommendation systems and addresses existing challenges effectively. Its novel approach, combined with robust empirical support, makes it a noteworthy contribution to the field.  **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Computational models of atrial electrophysiology (EP) are increasingly utilized for applications such as the development of advanced mapping systems, personalized clinical therapy planning, and the generation of virtual cohorts and digital twins. These models have the potential to establish robust causal links between simulated in silico behaviors and observed human atrial EP, enabling safer, cost-effective, and comprehensive exploration of atrial dynamics. However, current state-of-the-art approaches lack the fidelity and scalability required for regulatory-grade applications, particularly in creating high-quality virtual cohorts or patient-specific digital twins. Challenges include anatomically accurate model generation, calibration to sparse and uncertain clinical data, and computational efficiency within a streamlined workflow. This study addresses these limitations by introducing novel methodologies integrated into an automated end-to-end workflow for generating high-fidelity digital twin snapshots and virtual cohorts of atrial EP. These innovations include: (i) automated multi-scale generation of volumetric biatrial models with detailed anatomical structures and fiber architecture; (ii) a robust method for defining space-varying atrial parameter fields; (iii) a parametric approach for modeling inter-atrial conduction pathways; and (iv) an efficient forward EP model for high-fidelity electrocardiogram computation. We evaluated this workflow on a cohort of 50 atrial fibrillation patients, producing high-quality meshes suitable for reaction-eikonal and reaction-diffusion models and demonstrating the ability to simulate atrial ECGs under parametrically controlled conditions. These advancements represent a critical step toward scalable, precise, and clinically applicable digital twin models and virtual cohorts, enabling enhanced patient-specific predictions and therapeutic planning.

The framework was validated using a cohort of 50 atrial fibrillation patients, resulting in the production of high-quality computational meshes for advanced modeling and successful simulation of ECGs in a controlled parameter space. These advancements aim to facilitate the development of scalable digital twin technologies applicable in clinical settings for improved patient-specific predictions and therapeutic interventions. ### Evaluation of the Paper's Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Integration of Multiple Innovations**: This paper stands out by successfully integrating several methodologies into a unified automated workflow. This comprehensive approach is crucial for advancing the precision and usability of atrial electrophysiology models. 2. **Focus on Clinical Relevance**: The emphasis on creating models relevant for patient-specific applications increases its potential impact on clinical practices, such as personalized therapy planning and mapping systems. 3. **Validation on a Clinical Cohort**: The evaluation using actual patient data strengthens the paper's claims and highlights the practical applications of the proposed workflow. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Validation**: While 50 patients represent a notable effort, the cohort size is relatively small. Future studies with larger populations could enhance the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The automated process may require sophisticated computational resources and expertise, potentially limiting accessibility for some clinical practices or researchers if adequately standardized tools are not made widely available. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper does not provide a robust comparative analysis with existing methods to highlight how this new framework significantly outperforms previous methodologies in practical scenarios. **Overall Influence:** The paper introduces significant advancements in the modeling of atrial electrophysiology. By addressing key limitations of current computational approaches and providing a pathway toward clinically relevant applications, it has the potential to influence research and practice significantly in cardiovascular modeling and electrophysiology. ### Score Given the strengths of innovative integration, clinical applicability, and validation while considering the weaknesses related to cohort size and implementation complexity, I would assign the paper a score of **8**. This score reflects a robust contribution to the field, with substantial potential for influence and practical application but recognizing the need for broader validation and potential barriers to accessibility. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Momin Abbas, Muneeza Azmat, Raya Horesh, Mikhail Yurochkin
- **Abstract**: Distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for reliable deployment of classification systems. However, OOD data is typically unavailable or difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge for accurate OOD detection. In this work, we present a method that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create high-quality synthetic OOD proxies, eliminating the dependency on any external OOD data source. We study the efficacy of our method on classical text classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification as well as classification tasks arising in LLM development and deployment, such as training a reward model for RLHF and detecting misaligned generations. Extensive experiments on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and various model sizes show that our approach dramatically lowers false positive rates (achieving a perfect zero in some cases) while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution tasks, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Out-of-Distribution Detection using Synthetic Data Generation" addresses a critical challenge in machine learning — the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs — which is essential for the reliability of classification systems. The authors propose a method that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic data that serves as proxies for OOD examples, effectively mitigating the challenge of acquiring genuine OOD data. The method is evaluated across various classical text classification tasks, including toxicity detection and sentiment classification, as well as in contexts related to LLMs, such as the training of reward models for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and identification of misaligned generations. The results indicate that their synthetic data generation approach significantly reduces false positive rates and maintains high accuracy in in-distribution tasks, outperforming traditional detection methods across multiple datasets. **Evaluation:** The paper presents several notable strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: The utilization of LLMs for generating synthetic OOD data is a creative and original idea that addresses a major limitation in current OOD detection strategies, wherein real OOD data is scarce or challenging to obtain. 2. **Extensive Experiments**: The authors conducted comprehensive evaluations across nine different InD-OOD dataset pairs and multiple model sizes, demonstrating the robustness of their method and its practical applicability across various scenarios. 3. **Clear Results**: The reported improvements in false positive rates and in-distribution accuracy provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the method, suggesting practical implications for deployment in real-world applications of AI. However, the paper also has some weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability Concerns**: While the method shows promise on the selected datasets, the paper does not sufficiently discuss how the approach may perform on different contexts or novel datasets that were not part of the evaluation. It raises questions about the scalability and transferability of the proposed solution across diverse tasks. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The reliance on LLMs for synthetic data generation may introduce complexity in terms of computational resources and expertise required to implement this method, limiting accessibility for some practitioners. 3. **Comparison to Other Techniques**: Although it outperforms baseline methods, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of existing OOD detection methods, providing a clearer context for understanding its contributions. In light of these considerations, the paper stands out for its innovative approach to a well-defined problem and its strong empirical backing. That said, the concerns about generalizability and implementation complexity temper its impact.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution with real practical implications, but it also suggests that further work is needed to fully establish the method's applicability across diverse contexts and to broker its ease of use in various settings within the field.

### ECM: A Unified Electronic Circuit Model for Explaining the Emergence of In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03325v1)
- **Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng, Jiaqi Wang, Mengkang Hu, Zhi Chen, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant successes across various applications, where the most noticeable is to a series of emerging capabilities, particularly in the areas of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To better understand and control model performance, many studies have begun investigating the underlying causes of these phenomena and their impact on task outcomes. However, existing explanatory frameworks predominantly focus on isolating and explaining ICL and CoT independently, leading to an incomplete understanding of their combined influence on model performance. To address this gap, we propose the Electronic Circuit Model (ECM), which provides a foundation for developing scalable, learnable policies and improving the management of AI-generated content. Specifically, ECM conceptualizes model behavior as an electronic circuit: ICL is represented as semantic magnetic field to providing an additional voltage following Faraday's Law, while CoT is modeled as series resistors to constrain the model output performance following Ohm's Law. Experimental results demonstrate that the ECM effectively predicts and explains LLM performance across a variety of prompting strategies. Furthermore, we apply ECM to advanced reasoning strategy optimization on a series of tasks, such as the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), achieving competitive performance that surpasses nearly 80% of top human competitors.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces the Electronic Circuit Model (ECM) as a novel framework for understanding the intertwined phenomena of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs). While existing research typically addresses ICL and CoT independently, the ECM offers a unified approach by framing ICL as a semantic magnetic field that enhances model performance (analogous to inducing voltage) and CoT as series resistors that regulate output performance (based on Ohm's Law). The ECM demonstrates its predictive validity through experiments across varied prompt strategies and showcases its utility in improving reasoning strategies in competitive settings, achieving results that outperform a majority of top human participants in prestigious contests. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: The ECM presents a unique perspective by integrating concepts from physics (Faraday's and Ohm's Law) into the understanding of machine learning behaviors. This cross-disciplinary approach can inspire new methodologies in AI research and applications. 2. **Unified Explanation**: The paper addresses a notable gap in the existing literature by combining ICL and CoT, rather than treating them as distinct phenomena. This holistic view has the potential to enrich our understanding of model dynamics and performance. 3. **Experimental Validation**: The experimental results are promising, with the ECM demonstrating predictive capabilities across several conditions and outperforming human participants in reasoning tasks. This indicates practical implications and applicability in competitive and real-world scenarios. **Strengths:** - The intuitive use of electronic circuit analogies makes complex concepts more accessible. - The model's performance validation in actual competitions reflects its scalability and robustness. - A clear delineation of how ICL and CoT interact sets the stage for further research in optimizing LLMs. **Weaknesses:** - The theoretical grounding in physical analogies may lead to oversimplifications or misinterpretations of underlying mechanisms in LLM behavior, which are fundamentally different from physical systems. - The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of limitations in its experimental approach and the extent to which the findings can generalize across different types of LLMs. - There is limited discussion on how this model integrates with existing frameworks in AI, which might hinder researchers seeking to apply ECM alongside other prominent theories. **Conclusion:** Overall, the ECM offers a significant and innovative contribution to the field of LLM research. Its unification of previously isolated concepts and practical validation in competitive environments marks an important step forward, though some caution is warranted regarding the generalizability and theoretical implications of its premises. **Score: 8**  The score reflects strong novelty and relevance to the field, though it acknowledges some theoretical limitations and an opportunity for expanding discussions on integration with existing models.

### Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03327v1)
- **Authors**: Anastasis Kratsios, Takashi Furuya
- **Abstract**: The success of transformers is often linked to their ability to perform in-context learning. Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context" investigates the relationship between in-context learning capabilities and the success of transformers. It builds on previous work that demonstrated that transformers can approximate any continuous function in the context of a query. The authors challenge the assumption that in-context universality is the primary reason for the superior performance of transformers over classical models. They provide evidence that multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) with trainable activation functions also exhibit in-context universality. This finding implies that the advantages of transformers may stem from other factors, such as their inductive bias or training stability, rather than in-context learning capabilities alone. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant contribution by expanding the understanding of in-context learning capabilities beyond transformers to include MLPs with trainable parameters. This challenges prevailing notions regarding the uniqueness of transformers and encourages a broader exploration of model architectures in the context of function approximation. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Insight:** The proof of in-context universality for MLPs broadens the theoretical landscape, questioning the exclusive advantages attributed to transformers. 2. **Relevance:** The topic is timely, given the increasing reliance on transformer models in various machine learning applications. By suggesting alternative explanations for their success, the paper fosters further research into diverse model architectures. 3. **Challenge to Assumptions:** The work prompts researchers to reconsider accepted narratives in the community about why transformers perform well, which could lead to a more nuanced understanding of model performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Practical Implications:** While the theoretical findings are robust, the paper could benefit from more practical experiments comparing the performance of MLPs and transformers across various tasks, providing empirical validation of the theoretical claims. 2. **Focus on Universality:** The investigation centers heavily on universality without delving deeply into the implications of inductive bias and other factors influencing model success, which could enhance the discussions around model psychology. 3. **Potential Overreach:** The conclusion that transformer superiority is due to factors other than in-context learning could be seen as premature, lacking a comprehensive framework to analyze these factors systematically. In light of these strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of **7**. This score reflects the paper's solid theoretical contributions and its provocations in prompting further inquiry into model architectures. However, a more empirical approach and a nuanced analysis of contributing factors could enhance its impact and applicability in practical settings. **Score: 7**

### A Mixture-Based Framework for Guiding Diffusion Models

- **Authors**: Yazid Janati, Badr Moufad, Mehdi Abou El Qassime, Alain Durmus, Eric Moulines, Jimmy Olsson
- **Abstract**: Denoising diffusion models have driven significant progress in the field of Bayesian inverse problems. Recent approaches use pre-trained diffusion models as priors to solve a wide range of such problems, only leveraging inference-time compute and thereby eliminating the need to retrain task-specific models on the same dataset. To approximate the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem, a diffusion model samples from a sequence of intermediate posterior distributions, each with an intractable likelihood function. This work proposes a novel mixture approximation of these intermediate distributions. Since direct gradient-based sampling of these mixtures is infeasible due to intractable terms, we propose a practical method based on Gibbs sampling. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on image inverse problems, utilizing both pixel- and latent-space diffusion priors, as well as on source separation with an audio diffusion model. The code is available at https://www.github.com/badr-moufad/mgdm
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper proposes a novel mixture-based framework aimed at enhancing the performance of denoising diffusion models in the context of Bayesian inverse problems. Specifically, it addresses the challenge of approximating the posterior distributions that arise during inference, which typically involve intractable likelihood functions. The authors introduce a mixture approximation for these distributions and develop a Gibbs sampling method to overcome issues related to directly sampling from the mixtures. Extensive experimental validation is provided, showcasing the framework's efficacy across various image inverse problems and a distinct audio source separation task using diffusion models. The code for implementation is made publicly available. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The authors exhibit a clear understanding of the limitations of current methods in Bayesian inverse problems and diffusion models, effectively addressing a pertinent challenge within this domain. The introduction of a mixture framework for approximating intermediate posterior distributions stands out as a significant step forward. This is particularly relevant since diffusion models have been increasingly adopted in a variety of applications, yet the integration of effective posterior approximation methodologies has been less explored. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The mixture-based framework offers a novel perspective on approximating posterior distributions, which could improve the efficiency and efficacy of diffusion models in real-world tasks. 2. **Practical Implementation:** The introduction of Gibbs sampling as a practical solution to the issue of intractable likelihoods indicates a thoughtful consideration of the computational challenges involved, enhancing the framework's adaptability. 3. **Experimental Validation:** Comprehensive experiments across different applications bolster the proposed method's credibility and emphasize its potential utility in both image and audio domains. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Mixture Models:** While the mixture approximation provides potential benefits, the increased complexity could also complicate the implementation and understanding of the model architectures. Researchers might encounter challenges translating the methodology to other contexts. 2. **Generalizability:** The authors have primarily tested their framework on specific tasks within image and audio domains. There is a need for further validation across a broader range of inverse problems to assess its general applicability and robustness. 3. **Limited Historical Context:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with related works in the field to better establish the context and state of the art, as well as a clearer justification of its advancements over prior methods. **Conclusion:** The paper presents a promising direction for research in guiding diffusion models using mixture-based approximations. While it shows strong potential through innovative methods and practical relevance, the complexity and generalizability of the approach require more thorough exploration to ascertain its impact on the broader field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contribution to the field's understanding of posterior approximation in Bayesian contexts, while accounting for areas where further validation and development could enhance its overall influence.

- **Authors**: Chunwei Liu, Gerardo Vitagliano, Brandon Rose, Matt Prinz, David Andrew Samson, Michael Cafarella
- **Abstract**: Thanks to the advances in generative architectures and large language models, data scientists can now code pipelines of machine-learning operations to process large collections of unstructured data. Recent progress has seen the rise of declarative AI frameworks (e.g., Palimpzest, Lotus, and DocETL) to build optimized and increasingly complex pipelines, but these systems often remain accessible only to expert programmers. In this demonstration, we present PalimpChat, a chat-based interface to Palimpzest that bridges this gap by letting users create and run sophisticated AI pipelines through natural language alone. By integrating Archytas, a ReAct-based reasoning agent, and Palimpzest's suite of relational and LLM-based operators, PalimpChat provides a practical illustration of how a chat interface can make declarative AI frameworks truly accessible to non-experts. Our demo system is publicly available online. At SIGMOD'25, participants can explore three real-world scenarios--scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search--or apply PalimpChat to their own datasets. In this paper, we focus on how PalimpChat, supported by the Palimpzest optimizer, simplifies complex AI workflows such as extracting and analyzing biomedical data.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces PalimpChat, an intuitive chat-based interface that enhances the accessibility of the Palimpzest declarative AI framework for users who are not expert programmers. As data scientists increasingly rely on sophisticated machine-learning pipelines for processing unstructured data, existing declarative frameworks often necessitate advanced programming skills. PalimpChat addresses this barrier by allowing users to generate and execute AI pipelines through natural language queries. The integration of Archytas, a reasoning agent based on the ReAct paradigm, with Palimpzest’s array of relational and language model-based operators provides an interactive experience. Demonstrated through three practical applications—scientific discovery, legal inquiry, and real estate analysis—PalimpChat illustrates how complex workflows, including those involving biomedical data extraction and analysis, can be simplified for a broader audience. The system's demo is currently publicly available, promising hands-on engagement during the upcoming SIGMOD conference. --- ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty:** PalimpChat stands out by harnessing natural language interactions to simplify the utilization of advanced AI frameworks, which traditionally require significant technical knowledge. The integration of a chat interface with a powerful backend (Palimpzest) and a reasoning agent (Archytas) is a notable innovation as it impacts usability rather than just performance or complexity. This contribution fills a gap in making complex AI methodologies accessible to non-experts, a key issue in making AI technologies more democratic and widely usable. **Strengths:** 1. **User Accessibility:** By leveraging natural language, PalimpChat opens up AI tools to a larger demographic of users, including domain specialists in fields like healthcare and law who may lack programming expertise. 2. **Practical Applications:** The demonstration scenarios provide concrete use cases that highlight the practical utility of the tool, showcasing its relevance and potential impact across different sectors. 3. **Interactive Learning:** The chat interface allows users not only to execute functions but also to learn about the processes involved in building AI pipelines in an intuitive manner. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Prior Frameworks:** While PalimpChat is innovative, its underlying reliance on established frameworks like Palimpzest may limit its novelty relative to total independence. 2. **Scalability Concerns:** The described use cases might not address more complex data problems beyond the showcased scenarios, raising questions about scalability and robustness across diverse datasets and tasks. 3. **Evaluation of Effectiveness:** The paper does not provide substantial quantitative evaluations or metrics demonstrating the performance improvements or user satisfaction detailed in their case studies. **Potential Influence:** By enhancing accessibility and usability of sophisticated AI tools, PalimpChat has the potential to democratize data science. It could lead to broader participation in AI-driven analytics and ignite further research into user-centric AI frameworks. However, the long-term significance will depend on its adoption and the continued development of user-centered technologies in the field. Given these considerations, the overall score for this paper is based on its innovative approach, practical implications, and user-focused design, alongside its limitations in the breadth of evaluation. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions and novel approach to usability in AI frameworks while acknowledging the challenges and limitations that remain for broader applicability and evaluation.

### Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373v1)
- **Authors**: Edward Yeo, Yuxuan Tong, Morry Niu, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue
- **Abstract**: Scaling inference compute enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs), with long chains-of-thought (CoTs) enabling strategies like backtracking and error correction. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper "Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs" explores the mechanisms that enable large language models (LLMs) to perform long chains-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, focusing on the role of reinforcement learning (RL) in this context. The authors highlight that while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is not strictly necessary, it enhances training efficiency. They present empirical evidence showing that reasoning capabilities improve with increased compute, although this development isn't guaranteed; thus, reward shaping becomes essential for stabilizing CoT length. The paper emphasizes the importance of scaling verifiable reward signals for RL and suggests that using noisy, web-sourced data can be beneficial, especially for out-of-distribution tasks like STEM reasoning. Furthermore, it points out that core reasoning abilities exist in base models, but efficiently incentivizing these through RL requires significant computational resources and a nuanced evaluation approach. The findings aim to guide the optimization of training processes for enhancing long CoT reasoning in LLMs. --- **Evaluation**: The paper makes a notable contribution to the understanding of how long CoT reasoning can be effectively enabled in LLMs, which is a frontier area of research with increasing relevance in AI.

- **Authors**: Dennis Wu, Yihan He, Yuan Cao, Jianqing Fan, Han Liu
- **Abstract**: We give a comprehensive analysis of transformers as time series foundation models, focusing on their approximation and generalization capabilities. First, we demonstrate that there exist transformers that fit an autoregressive model on input univariate time series via gradient descent. We then analyze MOIRAI, a multivariate time series foundation model capable of handling an arbitrary number of covariates. We prove that it is capable of automatically fitting autoregressive models with an arbitrary number of covariates, offering insights into its design and empirical success. For generalization, we establish bounds for pretraining when the data satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Experiments support our theoretical findings, highlighting the efficacy of transformers as time series foundation models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper entitled "Transformers and Their Roles as Time Series Foundation Models" offers a detailed examination of transformers as foundational models for time series analysis. The authors present a proof that transformers can effectively fit autoregressive models to univariate time series data using gradient descent methods. Additionally, they introduce MOIRAI, a multivariate time series foundation model capable of accommodating multiple covariates, and they show that it can automatically fit autoregressive models regardless of the number of covariates involved. The study also establishes theoretical bounds for the generalization capabilities of these models under specific data conditions (Dobrushin's condition) and provides experimental results that affirm the practical efficacy of transformers for time series data. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty: The paper discusses the application of transformers to time series analysis, a relatively nascent area compared to image and natural language processing, where transformers have seen significant success. By proving the capability of transformers to fit autoregressive models and presenting a new model (MOIRAI) that can handle multivariate data, the paper contributes new insights to the machine learning community. However, while the application of transformers in time series is promising, the novelty may be considered limited in broader contexts, as several studies have begun exploring similar avenues. The theoretical contributions relating to generalization are valuable but hinge on the specific conditions outlined, which may limit their applicability to real-world datasets exhibiting more complex distributions. #### Significance: The significance of this research lies in its systematic approach to evaluating transformers in the context of time series forecasting, an increasingly important domain. The experimental validation reinforces the theoretical claims, making it a useful resource for practitioners and researchers looking to utilize transformers in time series applications. Also, the results could lead to advancements in predictive modeling across various disciplines, including finance, healthcare, and climate science. However, there could be concerns about the complexity of practical implementation and computational demands associated with large transformer models, which might deter their use in time-constrained environments or with limited resources. #### Strengths: 1. **Theoretical Foundations**: The paper provides strong theoretical backing for the performance of transformers in fitting autoregressive models. 2. **Innovative Model Design**: MOIRAI represents a notable advancement in multivariate time series modeling. 3. **Empirical Support**: The experimental results corroborate theoretical claims and demonstrate practical applicability. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Practical Applicability**: The results may not generalize well beyond the specific conditions outlined, particularly in datasets that do not conform to Dobrushin's condition. 2. **Emerging Competition**: As transformers gain traction, many potential competitors and techniques may soon emerge, potentially diluting the impact of this work. ### Conclusion The work provides meaningful insights into the use of transformers for time series analysis, notably expanding their applicability and efficiency.

### LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387v1)
- **Authors**: Yixin Ye, Zhen Huang, Yang Xiao, Ethan Chern, Shijie Xia, Pengfei Liu
- **Abstract**: We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning" presents a groundbreaking approach to understanding complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that traditional beliefs about the need for extensive datasets (over 100,000 examples) for sophisticated reasoning are incorrect. They introduce their model, LIMO, which demonstrates the ability to achieve notable mathematical reasoning performance using only 817 training samples. LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on the AIME benchmark and 94.8% on MATH, representing significant improvements over prior models—6.5% and 59.2%, respectively. Importantly, LIMO also shows excellent out-of-distribution generalization, improving performance across 10 diverse benchmarks despite using only 1% of the training data required by previous methods. The authors propose the "Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis," suggesting that when a model has a solid foundation of domain knowledge from pre-training, minimal examples can effectively guide the model in applying this knowledge to solve complex reasoning tasks. The paper emphasizes two key factors for effective reasoning: the model's pre-trained knowledge completeness and the quality of post-training examples as cognitive templates. The authors make LIMO available as an open-source suite to promote reproducibility and further research. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a significant shift in perspective regarding the relationship between the amount of training data and the ability to perform complex reasoning tasks in LLMs. By successfully demonstrating that fewer, well-structured examples can lead to high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks, it challenges established conventions and suggests new avenues for research in efficient model training. **Significance:** The findings have notable implications for the field of natural language processing (NLP) and AI, particularly as they pertain to the efficiency of model training. The identification of the "Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis" could inspire future research aimed at reducing the need for large datasets, which is often a barrier to entry for many research projects. Furthermore, the strong performance of LIMO on various benchmarks suggests practical applications in settings where data is scarce or costly to obtain. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The model's success in achieving high levels of accuracy with limited data is a compelling demonstration of the potential for more efficient training methods. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The extensive experimental validation across diverse benchmarks supports the findings and provides confidence in the model's capabilities. 3. **Open-source Initiative:** By providing open-source access to LIMO, the authors encourage community engagement and further exploration of their findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the paper focuses on mathematical reasoning, it would benefit from exploration in broader domains to validate the hypothesis across different contexts. 2. **Dependence on Pre-training:** The approach assumes robust domain knowledge is present from pre-training, which may not hold true for all foundation models, potentially limiting generalizability. 3. **Lack of Theoretical Framework:** Although the hypothesis is intriguing, a more rigorous theoretical underpinning would strengthen the argument and may help clarify the conditions under which it holds true. **Conclusion:** Given the paper's innovative hypothesis, practical implications for training efficiency, and the potential for stimulating further research in LLM utilization, it represents a notable contribution to the field, albeit with some limitations regarding scope and theoretical grounding. **Score: 8**

### SPRI: Aligning Large Language Models with Context-Situated Principles
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03397v1)
- **Authors**: Hongli Zhan, Muneeza Azmat, Raya Horesh, Junyi Jessy Li, Mikhail Yurochkin
- **Abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models to integrate and reflect human values, especially for tasks that demand intricate human oversight, is arduous since it is resource-intensive and time-consuming to depend on human expertise for context-specific guidance. Prior work has utilized predefined sets of rules or principles to steer the behavior of models (Bai et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). However, these principles tend to be generic, making it challenging to adapt them to each individual input query or context. In this work, we present Situated-PRInciples (SPRI), a framework requiring minimal or no human effort that is designed to automatically generate guiding principles in real-time for each input query and utilize them to align each response. We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness. We release our code and model generations at https://github.com/honglizhan/SPRI-public.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled “SPRI: Aligning Large Language Models with Context-Situated Principles” proposes a novel framework known as Situated-PRInciples (SPRI) aimed at better aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values during complex tasks requiring careful oversight. The authors argue that current methods relying on predefined rules or guiding principles are often too generic and lack adaptability to specific contexts. SPRI addresses this challenge by automatically generating context-specific guiding principles with minimal human involvement in real-time as each input query is processed. The framework is evaluated across three tasks, demonstrating that: 1. SPRI-generated principles perform comparably to those crafted by experts in complex, domain-specific scenarios. 2. The principles derived from SPRI create instance-specific rubrics that surpass the performance of previous frameworks that used LLMs as judges. 3. Utilizing SPRI to generate synthetic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data markedly improves truthfulness in responses. The authors have made their code and model generations publicly available, promoting further research and application. ### Critical Evaluation #### Strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: The SPRI framework presents a significant step forward by moving beyond generic rule sets to a dynamic, context-aware principle generation system. This is a key advancement in tailored LLM alignment. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The evaluation on multiple tasks lends credibility to the claims made by the authors. Achieving performance on par with expert-crafted principles showcases the framework’s effectiveness in real-world scenarios. 3. **Public Accessibility**: By open-sourcing the code and models, the authors encourage community engagement and further innovation, which is vital for scientific progress. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the paper presents promising results, the scope of evaluations across only three tasks may limit the generalizability of the SPRI framework. Broader testing could strengthen the validation of the method. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: The practical implementation of SPRI across diverse contexts might present challenges that are not addressed in this initial study. Real-world applications often face unique hurdles that may not be captured in controlled evaluations. 3. **Lack of long-term insights**: The paper does not adequately discuss the long-term effects of using SPRI on model behavior and alignment robustness. Continuous monitoring of generated principles would be necessary to evaluate their sustained impact over time. ### Score: 7 The score of 7 reflects a solid contribution to the field, balancing significant innovation with some limitations regarding generalizability and practical implementation. The SPRI framework introduces a fresh perspective on aligning LLMs with human values, which is an increasingly crucial area of research given the growing deployment of these models in sensitive domains. If future work addresses the identified weaknesses, particularly in broader validation and long-term effects, SPRI could elevate its impact significantly within the field of AI alignment.

- **Abstract**: We present LiGR, a large-scale ranking framework developed at LinkedIn that brings state-of-the-art transformer-based modeling architectures into production. We introduce a modified transformer architecture that incorporates learned normalization and simultaneous set-wise attention to user history and ranked items. This architecture enables several breakthrough achievements, including: (1) the deprecation of most manually designed feature engineering, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art system using only few features (compared to hundreds in the baseline), (2) validation of the scaling law for ranking systems, showing improved performance with larger models, more training data, and longer context sequences, and (3) simultaneous joint scoring of items in a set-wise manner, leading to automated improvements in diversity. To enable efficient serving of large ranking models, we describe techniques to scale inference effectively using single-pass processing of user history and set-wise attention. We also summarize key insights from various ablation studies and A/B tests, highlighting the most impactful technical approaches.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents LiGR, an innovative ranking framework developed by LinkedIn that integrates state-of-the-art transformer architectures into large-scale production environments. Key features of this framework include a modified transformer with learned normalization and set-wise attention mechanisms that consider both user history and ranked items simultaneously. The framework achieves significant advancements by reducing the reliance on manually designed features, demonstrating enhanced performance with scalability in model size, training data, and context length, and allowing for diversity improvements through joint scoring of items. Additionally, the authors describe efficient inference techniques that utilize single-pass processing, and they provide insights gained from ablation studies and A/B tests that emphasize effective technical strategies. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its integration of transformer architectures into ranking systems, which has been a growing trend across various machine learning applications. The paper effectively highlights the reduction of feature engineering through the use of transformers, potentially paving the way for more automatic feature extraction techniques in collaborative and ranking tasks. The incorporation of learned normalization and attention mechanisms is also noteworthy, particularly the emphasis on set-wise attention which acknowledges the interactivity between items, a concept that enhances user-centric personalization. Strengths of the paper include its empirical validation of scaling laws, which is crucial for guiding future research and applications in ranking systems. The A/B tests and ablation studies provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Moreover, the practical applicability of their techniques pursues an efficient inference process that can handle large model outputs—a critical factor in real-world applications. However, some weaknesses are present. The paper could elaborate more on the comparison of scalability and performance metrics against other contemporary models beyond the previously established state-of-the-art. Furthermore, while the elimination of manual feature engineering is touted as a breakthrough, it would be beneficial to discuss the potential trade-offs in interpretability and transparency when relying solely on automated processes. Lastly, potential biases introduced by transformer models during ranking are not widely addressed, which could be important given the implications on fairness and diversity. In summary, while the paper shows strong advancements and offers significant insights into the optimization of ranking models, it could benefit from a deeper discourse on its limitations and challenges going forward. Overall, it presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of machine learning and ranking systems, especially within an industry context. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03418v1)
- **Authors**: Nikta Gohari Sadr, Sangmitra Madhusudan, Ali Emami
- **Abstract**: Zero-shot prompting techniques have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we lack a clear understanding of why zero-shot prompts are so effective. For example, in the prompt "Let's think step-by-step," is "think" or "step-by-step" more crucial to its success? Existing interpretability methods, such as gradient-based and attention-based approaches, are computationally intensive and restricted to open-source models. We introduce the ZIP score (Zero-shot Importance of Perturbation score), a versatile metric applicable to both open and closed-source models, based on systematic input word perturbations. Our experiments across four recent LLMs, seven widely-used prompts, and several tasks, reveal interesting patterns in word importance. For instance, while both 'step-by-step' and 'think' show high ZIP scores, which one is more influential depends on the model and task. We validate our method using controlled experiments and compare our results with human judgments, finding that proprietary models align more closely with human intuition regarding word significance. These findings enhance our understanding of LLM behavior and contribute to developing more effective zero-shot prompts and improved model analysis.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Think or Step-by-Step? UnZIPping the Black Box in Zero-Shot Prompts" investigates the effectiveness of zero-shot prompting methods for Large Language Models (LLMs) and seeks to clarify which components of prompts contribute most to their success. The authors present the Zero-shot Importance of Perturbation (ZIP) score, a novel metric that assesses the significance of individual words in input prompts by analyzing systematic perturbations. Through experiments conducted on four LLMs and various prompts and tasks, they uncover patterns in word importance, noting that the influence of specific keywords like "think" or "step-by-step" is context-dependent. Their method demonstrates applicability to both open-source and proprietary models, with findings validating its correlation with human judgment in terms of word significance. The study ultimately aims to deepen understanding of LLM behavior and improve zero-shot prompting strategies. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The introduction of the ZIP score is a significant advancement in the field of interpretability for LLMs. Many existing methods for understanding model behavior are either too computationally expensive or limited to open-source models. By providing a simple yet effective metric applicable to a wider range of models, the authors address a notable gap in the literature and offer a more accessible tool for researchers and practitioners. **Significance**: The findings presented in this paper contribute to the broader conversation about how zero-shot prompts can be optimized, which can have practical implications for improving LLM performance in real-world applications. By analyzing the role of individual words within prompts, this research helps demystify how language models interpret instructions, potentially leading to more effective communication with AI systems and better user experiences. **Strengths**: 1. **Methodological Rigor**: The use of systematic perturbations to derive the ZIP score is sound. The experiments are thorough, encompassing multiple models and tasks, which enhances the robustness of the findings. 2. **Real-World Application**: The results have practical implications—improving the design of prompts could directly impact user interaction with LLMs, making AI more user-friendly and effective. 3. **Alignment with Human Judgment**: The paper’s validation that results correlate with human intuition is compelling, showcasing the potential utility of the ZIP score. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Scope of Models**: While the paper addresses several recent LLMs, the experiments could benefit from a broader range of models, including those with different architectures or training regimens. 2. **Dependence on Tasks**: The findings indicate that the importance of words varies by task, which suggests that the generalizability of the results may be limited. More exploration into various domains or tasks could strengthen the conclusions. 3. **Lack of Depth in Analysis**: While the ZIP score captures word importance, the paper might benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the underlying mechanisms driving these word influences—explaining *why* certain words are more impactful could provide valuable insights. ### Conclusion Overall, "Think or Step-by-Step? UnZIPping the Black Box in Zero-Shot Prompts" presents a meaningful contribution to the field of LLM interpretability and prompt design. Its introduction of the ZIP score offers a valuable tool that could enhance user engagement with AI systems.

- **Authors**: Oussama Ben Sghaier, Martin Weyssow, Houari Sahraoui
- **Abstract**: In code review, generating structured and relevant comments is crucial for identifying code issues and facilitating accurate code changes that ensure an efficient code review process. Well-crafted comments not only streamline the code review itself but are also essential for subsequent tasks like code refinement, where the code is modified to satisfy the input review comment. Although various AI-based approaches aimed to automate comment generation, their effectiveness remains limited by the quality of the training data. Existing code review datasets are often noisy and unrefined, posing limitations to the learning potential of AI models and hindering the automation process. To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset. We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset. Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset. A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement. Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments. Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "Harnessing Large Language Models for Curated Code Reviews" addresses the critical need for effective comment generation in code reviews, which is vital for identifying issues and facilitating correct code modifications. It highlights the limitations of existing AI approaches due to poor-quality, noisy training data from current code review datasets. To overcome this, the authors propose a curation pipeline aimed at improving the largest publicly available code review dataset. They establish an evaluation framework to assess initial dataset quality before applying a large language model-driven curation process. The results indicate significant enhancements in both the clarity and conciseness of comments post-curation. Furthermore, the paper demonstrates that using this curated dataset leads to improved performance in automating comment generation and subsequent code refinement tasks. ### Evaluation: The paper presents several noteworthy contributions to the field of code review and AI-based tools.  **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Real Problem:** The need for structured and relevant comments in code reviews is well recognized in software engineering. The focus on improving the training data quality directly addresses a significant barrier to effective code review automation. 2. **Curation Pipeline:** The introduction of a curation pipeline is innovative and potentially transformative. It lays the groundwork for developing better datasets, impacting model training and performance. 3. **Evaluation Framework:** The establishment of a systematic evaluation framework for code review datasets adds rigor to their methodology and provides a reproducible way to assess data quality, which can benefit future research in this area. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of Findings:** While the paper demonstrates improvements using a specific dataset, it remains to be seen how widely applicable the curation pipeline is across different programming languages or contexts. 2. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** The study focuses heavily on comment clarity and conciseness but could explore additional dimensions of comment quality, such as relevance or specificity. 3. **AI Limitations Discussion:** The paper could improve by discussing the limitations and potential biases of large language models, particularly how these may affect the generation of contextually appropriate comments. **Potential Influence:** This work has significant implications for both academia and industry by setting a precedent for future research on AI in code review processes.

### TruePose: Human-Parsing-guided Attention Diffusion for Full-ID Preserving Pose Transfer
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03426v1)
- **Authors**: Zhihong Xu, Dongxia Wang, Peng Du, Yang Cao, Qing Guo
- **Abstract**: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates images that maintain a subject's identity from a source image while adopting a specified target pose (e.g., skeleton). While diffusion-based PGPIS methods effectively preserve facial features during pose transformation, they often struggle to accurately maintain clothing details from the source image throughout the diffusion process. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when there is a substantial difference between the source and target poses, significantly impacting PGPIS applications in the fashion industry where clothing style preservation is crucial for copyright protection. Our analysis reveals that this limitation primarily stems from the conditional diffusion model's attention modules failing to adequately capture and preserve clothing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose human-parsing-guided attention diffusion, a novel approach that effectively preserves both facial and clothing appearance while generating high-quality results. We propose a human-parsing-aware Siamese network that consists of three key components: dual identical UNets (TargetNet for diffusion denoising and SourceNet for source image embedding extraction), a human-parsing-guided fusion attention (HPFA), and a CLIP-guided attention alignment (CAA). The HPFA and CAA modules can embed the face and clothes patterns into the target image generation adaptively and effectively. Extensive experiments on both the in-shop clothes retrieval benchmark and the latest in-the-wild human editing dataset demonstrate our method's significant advantages over 13 baseline approaches for preserving both facial and clothes appearance in the source image.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "TruePose: Human-Parsing-guided Attention Diffusion for Full-ID Preserving Pose Transfer" addresses the challenge of Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS), focusing on ensuring identity preservation while transferring poses. The authors identify a significant shortcoming in existing diffusion-based methods, which typically excel at maintaining facial features but falter in retaining clothing details when there is a large divergence between source and target poses. This issue is critical for applications in the fashion industry, where preserving clothing styles is essential for copyright considerations.  To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce a novel framework involving a human-parsing-aware Siamese network comprising dual identical UNets, a human-parsing-guided fusion attention (HPFA) mechanism, and a CLIP-guided attention alignment (CAA) component. This architecture allows for improved adaptation and incorporation of clothing and facial patterns from the source image into the generated target image. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance compared to 13 baseline approaches on established datasets, suggesting significant advancements in preserving both identity and clothing appearance during pose transformations. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a well-defined problem within the domain of person image synthesis, specifically focusing on the dual challenge of maintaining both identity and clothing details during pose transformations. The novelty is grounded in the introduction of the human-parsing-guided attention diffusion mechanism, which seems to fill a clear gap identified in current methodologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Original Contribution**: The integration of human parsing into the attention diffusion process is a fresh approach, providing a potentially impactful enhancement in synthesizing accurate clothing details. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The authors conduct extensive experiments across multiple established datasets that lend credibility to their claims regarding the performance of TruePose against various baselines. 3. **Relevance**: The direct application to the fashion industry is notable, as it addresses real-world problems regarding copyright preservation and representation. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Implementation Complexity**: While the proposed model shows improved accuracy, the complexity and required resources for deployment may limit its accessibility for some users or smaller organizations. 2. **Generalization**: The paper should elaborate more on how well the proposed system generalizes across various demographic factors and diverse clothing styles, as the effectiveness could be context-dependent. 3. **Comparative Baselines**: Although comparisons with 13 baselines are impressive, details on these methods’ shortcomings could further contextualize the contribution, potentially making the argument for superiority stronger. **Overall Impact**: TruePose represents a meaningful advancement in PGPIS by addressing specific shortcomings related to clothing detail retention. However, its complexity and the need for additional explorations into its generalizability limit wider applicability and usage. **Score: 8**  The score reflects a strong contribution to the field, with clear advancements in methodology and application, tempered by concerns regarding implementation complexity and broad applicability.

### On Fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Image Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03429v1)
- **Authors**: Ming Liu, Hao Chen, Jindong Wang, Liwen Wang, Bhiksha Raj Ramakrishnan, Wensheng Zhang
- **Abstract**: Unified multimodal large language models (U-MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in visual understanding and generation in an end-to-end pipeline. Compared with generation-only models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), U-MLLMs may raise new questions about bias in their outputs, which can be affected by their unified capabilities. This gap is particularly concerning given the under-explored risk of propagating harmful stereotypes. In this paper, we benchmark the latest U-MLLMs and find that most exhibit significant demographic biases, such as gender and race bias. To better understand and mitigate this issue, we propose a locate-then-fix strategy, where we audit and show how the individual model component is affected by bias. Our analysis shows that bias originates primarily from the language model. More interestingly, we observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon in U-MLLMs, where understanding bias appears minimal, but generation bias remains substantial. Thus, we propose a novel balanced preference model to balance the demographic distribution with synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic bias while preserving semantic fidelity. We hope our findings underscore the need for more holistic interpretation and debiasing strategies of U-MLLMs in the future.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "On Fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Image Generation" investigates the occurrence of bias in unified multimodal large language models (U-MLLMs) that are capable of visual understanding and generation. Despite their impressive end-to-end performance, the authors highlight concerns regarding demographic biases related to gender and race, suggesting an under-explored risk of perpetuating harmful stereotypes through these models. They benchmark current U-MLLMs and utilize a "locate-then-fix" strategy to audit bias within individual components, identifying that the primary source of bias originates from the language model itself. Furthermore, they observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon where the understanding of bias is limited while generational bias is pronounced. To address this issue, the authors propose a balanced preference model to align demographic distributions with synthetic data, demonstrating that their approach significantly reduces demographic bias while maintaining semantic accuracy. The authors call for a comprehensive understanding and approach to debiasing U-MLLMs moving forward. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents a valuable contribution to the study of bias in U-MLLMs, which is an increasingly relevant topic as these models gain popularity for their versatility in generating both text and images. The methodology employed, including the benchmarking of various U-MLLMs and the systematic "locate-then-fix" strategy, is commendable as it provides clarity on how biases manifest within different model components. The identification of the "partial alignment" phenomenon is particularly noteworthy; it reveals nuanced insights into bias that might not be readily apparent, solidifying the need for targeted debiasing efforts. However, there are some weaknesses in the paper. The scope of the benchmarking could have been more extensive, potentially encompassing a broader spectrum of U-MLLMs across different models to establish more comprehensive conclusions about demographic biases. Additionally, while the proposed balanced preference model shows promise, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the long-term implications and potential limitations of implementing such a model in practical applications. Furthermore, the paper could have considered the intersectionality of biases more thoroughly, as demographic attributes often interact in complex ways that might not be fully captured by focusing on individual characteristics alone. Despite these limitations, the significance of the findings—especially within the context of growing awareness and concerns around fairness in AI—cannot be understated. The authors advocate for more holistic approaches to understanding and mitigating bias, which is vital as U-MLLMs continue to be integrated into various applications. Overall, the paper demonstrates substantial originality and relevance, addressing a critical gap in the literature regarding the fairness of U-MLLMs. **Score: 8**

### BFS-Prover: Scalable Best-First Tree Search for LLM-based Automatic Theorem Proving
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03438v1)
- **Authors**: Ran Xin, Chenguang Xi, Jie Yang, Feng Chen, Hang Wu, Xia Xiao, Yifan Sun, Shen Zheng, Kai Shen
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present \texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. \texttt{BFS-Prover} achieves a score of $71.31$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents "BFS-Prover," a framework that applies Best-First Search (BFS) to large language model (LLM)-based automatic theorem proving, particularly in the Lean4 environment. The authors argue that previous approaches focused heavily on complex search techniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), while simpler methods like BFS had not been thoroughly investigated. BFS-Prover leverages three innovative strategies to enhance its effectiveness:  1. **Strategic Data Filtering**: At each iteration, problems that can be solved with simpler node expansions through beam search are filtered out, allowing the algorithm to concentrate on more challenging problems. 2. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**: This technique refines the LLM's policy using feedback from compiler errors, enhancing the sample efficiency of BFS by prioritizing more fruitful search paths. 3. **Length Normalization**: This approach promotes deeper proof exploration, encouraging the algorithm to pursue longer proof paths. The results demonstrate that BFS-Prover achieves a score of 71.31 on the MiniF2F test set, suggesting that BFS can be effectively applied to theorem proving tasks when optimized properly. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The novelty of the paper lies in its proposal to apply BFS in the context of automatic theorem proving, presenting it as a viable alternative to more complex methods like MCTS. While BFS is a well-understood algorithm, its application to LLM-based theorem proving represents a fresh perspective, especially through the incorporation of innovations like DPO and strategic filtering. However, BFS as a method isn't fundamentally new to search strategies in AI; its adaptation to this domain is the key innovation. **Significance:** The significance of this work is notable. The authors manage to challenge the prevailing notion that complex tree search methods are necessary for competitive performance in theorem proving. Their results imply a potential shift in approach within the community, advocating for simpler, more scalable methodologies. If further validated, this could streamline research and application in automated reasoning. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodologies**: The introduction of data filtering, DPO, and length normalization are compelling contributions that could inspire further research. 2. **Performance Results**: The competitive performance score indicates that BFS can indeed be effective under the right conditions, suggesting practical implications. 3. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper is well-structured and concise, making it accessible to readers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors do highlight the performance of BFS-Prover, a more detailed comparative analysis between BFS and MCTS or other search techniques could strengthen the arguments regarding its advantages and limitations. 2. **Generalizability**: The focus on the MiniF2F test set raises questions regarding the generalizability of the results. How BFS-Prover performs on diverse, real-world problems beyond this dataset remains unexamined. **Influence on the Field:** If the claims are substantiated through further studies, this work may influence the development of simpler, more efficient automated theorem proving systems, sparking interest in re-evaluating the reliance on more complex search strategies. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper’s substantial novelty and significance, balanced against its limitations in comparative analysis and generalizability. The innovations introduced could could promote a rethinking of search strategies in theorem proving, making this a meaningful contribution to the field.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness for high-resolution image synthesis. However, the properties of the latent space from tokenizer for better learning and generation of diffusion models remain under-explored. Theoretically and empirically, we find that improved generation quality is closely tied to the latent distributions with better structure, such as the ones with fewer Gaussian Mixture modes and more discriminative features. Motivated by these insights, we propose MAETok, an autoencoder (AE) leveraging mask modeling to learn semantically rich latent space while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments validate our analysis, demonstrating that the variational form of autoencoders is not necessary, and a discriminative latent space from AE alone enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation using only 128 tokens. MAETok achieves significant practical improvements, enabling a gFID of 1.69 with 76x faster training and 31x higher inference throughput for 512x512 generation. Our findings show that the structure of the latent space, rather than variational constraints, is crucial for effective diffusion models. Code and trained models are released.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Masked Autoencoders Are Effective Tokenizers for Diffusion Models" investigates the latent space properties of tokenizers in the context of latent diffusion models for high-resolution image synthesis. The authors recognize that the composition of the latent space plays a significant role in determining the quality of image generation. They introduce MAETok, which employs mask modeling in an autoencoder framework to develop a semantically rich latent space while ensuring high reconstruction fidelity. The study asserts that it's not necessary to utilize a variational form for autoencoders; instead, a simple autoencoder can produce a discriminative latent space that leads to superior performance in image generation, outperforming traditional methods while achieving significant reductions in training time and increases in inference speed. Empirical results support their hypotheses, showing notable improvements in both the quality and efficiency of image generation tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper effectively combines concepts from autoencoding and diffusion models to address latent space structuring, which is an under-explored area. While previous works have touched on the importance of latents in generative models, the novel contribution lies in emphasizing the effectiveness of a masked autoencoder as a tokenization method specifically tailored for diffusion models. This alternative perspective adds a fresh angle to the discourse, emphasizing latent space structure over traditional reliance on variational constraints. **Strengths:** - **Practical Impact:** The reported improvements in generative fidelity (gFID of 1.69), training speed, and inference throughput (76x and 31x improvements, respectively) suggest that this method can significantly enhance the practical deployment of diffusion models in real-world applications. - **Comprehensive Validation:** The extensive experiments conducted resonate well with the theoretical insights presented, establishing a strong foundation for the claims made regarding the benefits of the MAETok approach. - **Accessibility:** The release of accompanied code and trained models fosters reproducibility and encourages further exploration within the community. **Weaknesses:** - **Limited Theoretical Framework:** While the empirical results are solid, the theoretical underpinning for claiming the superiority of non-variational approaches could be elaborated further. This would strengthen the paper's claims by providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that lead to improved performance. - **Comparative Analysis:** The paper primarily juxtaposes MAETok against traditional autoencoders and does not extensively explore or mention how this approach measures against recent advancements in other tokenization strategies. **Conclusion:** Overall, the study presents a meaningful advancement in the field of generative models, particularly within the scope of diffusion mechanisms. The innovative approach of leveraging masked autoencoders challenges existing paradigms about latent space structuring and offers a compelling solution for high-resolution image synthesis. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03449v1)
- **Authors**: Xuan Li, Chang Yu, Wenxin Du, Ying Jiang, Tianyi Xie, Yunuo Chen, Yin Yang, Chenfanfu Jiang
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in large models have significantly advanced image-to-3D reconstruction. However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image. Furthermore, by integrating a texture generation module and a human motion generation module, we produce customized physics-plausible and realistic dynamic garment demonstrations. Project page: https://dress-1-to-3.github.io/
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Dress-1-to-3" presents a novel pipeline for generating simulation-ready 3D garments from single images, emphasizing the need for garments that are both separable and suitable for dynamic applications like virtual try-on. The proposed approach consists of several distinct yet integrated components: it employs a pre-trained model to generate coarse sewing patterns from the input image and a multi-view diffusion model to create multi-view images. Subsequently, these elements are enhanced through a differentiable garment simulator that refines the sewing patterns based on the generated images. The resulting pipeline demonstrates superior geometric alignment of the reconstructed garments and human figures with the original images. Additionally, the inclusion of modules for texture generation and human motion aims to create dynamic, realistic garment animations. The results indicate significant improvements in garment generation and alignment, affirming the practicality of the approach in real-world applications. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper introduces a comprehensive and integrated approach that addresses a significant gap in current image-to-3D garment reconstruction methodologies. Existing models often produce fused garments, which are not readily applicable for tasks like virtual try-on that demand separable, realistic garments. By combining sewing pattern generation with multi-view imagery and a physics-based garment simulator, Dress-1-to-3 represents a noteworthy advancement. This multifaceted approach enhances both the granularity and realism of the output, highlighting a novel intersection of diffusion models and differentiable physics. #### Significance The significance of this research is underscored by its potential applications in e-commerce, gaming, and fashion technology. The ability to produce dynamic and interactive garments aligns with current trends in virtual and augmented realities, catering to a growing demand for personalized online experiences.

### A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03450v1)
- **Authors**: Yiye Chen, Harpreet Sawhney, Nicholas Gydé, Yanan Jian, Jack Saunders, Patricio Vela, Ben Lundell
- **Abstract**: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations. Project code will be released.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework that facilitates reasoning and planning over scene graphs using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework features two cooperative LLM agents: a Reasoner, which generates task plans and information queries, and a Retriever, which extracts relevant graph data based on those queries. This two-agent system allows them to collaborate iteratively, promoting sequential reasoning and improved attention to graph information. A distinct advantage of this approach is that both agents are only provided with the schema of the scene graph rather than the entire graph data, effectively mitigating issues of hallucination by limiting input and prompting the Reasoner to produce more abstract traces. Subsequently, the Retriever retrieves necessary data dynamically, optimizing alignment between reasoning and retrieval processes. Experimental results demonstrate that SG-RwR outperforms existing LLM-based methods in numerical question answering and planning tasks, also showing adaptability to task-level few-shot examples without relying on agent-level demonstrations. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of SG-RwR lies in its dual-agent architecture focused on scene graphs, which represents a differentiated approach compared to previous LLM applications that often deal with full graph data. By emphasizing a schema-guided methodology, the authors address the challenges of information overload and the tendency for LLMs to generate irrelevant outcomes (hallucinations). This methodology is particularly significant in contexts that demand structured reasoning, such as planning in complex environments. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The introduction of a cooperative dual-agent system is a clear advancement in the field of spatial reasoning with LLMs.  2. **Reduction of Hallucination**: By employing a schema rather than full data, the potential for LLMs to exhibit hallucinations appears to be significantly reduced. 3. **Empirical Validation**: Through comprehensive experiments demonstrating superior performance over existing models, the authors bolster the credibility of their claims. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Generalization Concerns**: While the results appear promising, the effectiveness of the framework across diverse real-world scenarios hasn't been established, potentially limiting its generalizability. 2. **Scalability**: The reliance on schema-guided methods raises questions about scalability and adaptability within more complex or varied environments. 3. **Implementation Details**: The framework's implementation may not be trivial, and the paper lacks detailed explanation on the potential challenges others may face in replication or application. In comparison to existing works, while SG-RwR does offer a significant contribution, it may not represent a paradigm shift in the field of LLM reasoning. It builds upon prior studies but provides a noteworthy enhancement rather than a completely new methodology. Given the framework's innovative approach, empirical support, and the potential for practical applications in spatial reasoning, I assign a score of 8. This score reflects the paper's significant but not groundbreaking contribution, acknowledging both its strengths and its limitations in broader applicability or transformative impact within the field. **Score: 8**

### Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03460v1)
- **Authors**: Boyao Wang, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Xingyuan Pan, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Tong Zhang
- **Abstract**: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training" focuses on enhancing the efficiency of small language models (SLMs) through a novel pruning technique called layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner). This approach aims to address the challenges of training SLMs from scratch or pruning existing large language models (LLMs), which often results in performance degradation. The key findings include: 1. Adapt-Pruner significantly improves the performance of LLMs through more effective pruning. 2. When combined with further training, adaptive pruning achieves performance levels comparable to models pre-trained from scratch. 3. An incremental pruning strategy allows for fine-tuning during the training process, gradually removing around 5% of neurons at a time and leading to notable performance gains. Experimentally, Adapt-Pruner surpasses existing methods (LLM-Pruner, FLAP, SliceGPT) by 1%-7% accuracy on commonsense benchmarks using LLaMA-3.1-8B. Moreover, it restores MobileLLM-125M performance on the MMLU benchmark to a level akin to that of larger models while using significantly fewer tokens. Furthermore, it achieves the novel development of a new 1B model that outperforms the LLaMA-3.2-1B across multiple benchmarks. --- **Evaluation:** The paper presents a clear advancement in the field of small language model optimization, primarily via its proposed Adapt-Pruner technique. Its ability to enhance performance while effectively pruning demonstrates significant novelty, especially given the challenges associated with maintaining model efficacy post-pruning. Conventional methods typically fall short by either suffering from substantial performance drops or requiring prohibitive computational resources for training from scratch.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** Introduces a new methodology for structured pruning which is shown to be effective and adaptable during training phases. 2. **Comparative Results:** Empirical validation against existing state-of-the-art pruning methods showcases tangible improvements. 3. **Broader Implications:** The ability to create smaller models with high performance is particularly relevant for deployment on edge devices, aligning with current industry trends focusing on efficiency. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising for specific configurations (like LLaMA-3.1-8B), the generalizability of the findings to other architectures or tasks warrants further exploration. 2. **Complexity in Application:** The proposed method may introduce additional complexity into the model training process which could hinder adoption among practitioners who prefer simpler approaches. 3. **Limited Theoretical Framework:** The paper could benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning justifying the mechanisms behind adaptive pruning's effectiveness. **Final Influence:** While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of model compression and efficiency for SLMs, its impact could be tempered by the need for further validations across diverse contexts and architectures. Future work could explore the breadth of Adapt-Pruner's applicability, potentially increasing its significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's innovative contributions and its pragmatic application in a relevant field, while also accounting for the need for further validation and simplification for broader adoption.

### Do Large Language Model Benchmarks Test Reliability?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03461v1)
- **Authors**: Joshua Vendrow, Edward Vendrow, Sara Beery, Aleksander Madry
- **Abstract**: When deploying large language models (LLMs), it is important to ensure that these models are not only capable, but also reliable. Many benchmarks have been created to track LLMs' growing capabilities, however there has been no similar focus on measuring their reliability. To understand the potential ramifications of this gap, we investigate how well current benchmarks quantify model reliability. We find that pervasive label errors can compromise these evaluations, obscuring lingering model failures and hiding unreliable behavior. Motivated by this gap in the evaluation of reliability, we then propose the concept of so-called platinum benchmarks, i.e., benchmarks carefully curated to minimize label errors and ambiguity. As a first attempt at constructing such benchmarks, we revise examples from fifteen existing popular benchmarks. We evaluate a wide range of models on these platinum benchmarks and find that, indeed, frontier LLMs still exhibit failures on simple tasks such as elementary-level math word problems. Analyzing these failures further reveals previously unidentified patterns of problems on which frontier models consistently struggle. We provide code at https://github.com/MadryLab/platinum-benchmarks
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in the context of existing benchmarks that predominantly focus on evaluating capabilities rather than reliability. The authors highlight that many benchmarks suffer from label errors, which can distort the assessment of model performance and mask areas of unreliability. To address this issue, they introduce the concept of "platinum benchmarks," which are meticulously curated to minimize errors and ambiguities. They revise a selection of examples from fifteen well-known benchmarks to create these platinum benchmarks. Through evaluation of various LLMs against these new benchmarks, the authors reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle with basic tasks, such as elementary math word problems, and identify patterns of consistent failures. The paper contributes by emphasizing the need for reliability assessments in LLM performance evaluations and offers a practical resource through its platinum benchmarks, with associated code made publicly available. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant addition to the dialogue surrounding the evaluation of large language models, as it shifts attention from performance metrics to reliability. This focus is timely given the increasing deployment of LLMs in critical applications. The introduction of platinum benchmarks is particularly innovative, as it aims to establish a new standard for assessing model reliability. By identifying and documenting label inaccuracies in existing benchmarks, the authors effectively underpin their argument for the need for carefully curated evaluation methods. However, while the methodology of creating platinum benchmarks shows promise, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of how these benchmarks compare against existing ones in terms of predictive power and utility in real-world applications. Additionally, while the identification of specific failure patterns is valuable, the broader implications of these findings—such as how they might lead to improvements in model training or architecture—could have been explored more thoroughly. The code repository provided enhances the paper's practical relevance, allowing researchers and practitioners to implement and contribute to this area of inquiry. However, the implications of these findings for future LLM development are not deeply considered. Overall, the novelty lies in the introduction of reliability as a separate performance metric and the concrete suggestion of platinum benchmarks. It addresses a significant gap in the field but does not exhaustively explore the consequences of its findings or provide extensive data on benchmark efficacy. **Score: 7**  Justification: The paper is crucial for promoting a balanced understanding of LLM capabilities versus reliability, showing potential for advancing the field. However, it lacks in-depth exploration and expansive implications regarding the observed issues, resulting in a score that indicates commendable, but not groundbreaking, contributions to the field.
