- **Abstract**: Computational models of atrial electrophysiology (EP) are increasingly utilized for applications such as the development of advanced mapping systems, personalized clinical therapy planning, and the generation of virtual cohorts and digital twins. These models have the potential to establish robust causal links between simulated in silico behaviors and observed human atrial EP, enabling safer, cost-effective, and comprehensive exploration of atrial dynamics. However, current state-of-the-art approaches lack the fidelity and scalability required for regulatory-grade applications, particularly in creating high-quality virtual cohorts or patient-specific digital twins. Challenges include anatomically accurate model generation, calibration to sparse and uncertain clinical data, and computational efficiency within a streamlined workflow. This study addresses these limitations by introducing novel methodologies integrated into an automated end-to-end workflow for generating high-fidelity digital twin snapshots and virtual cohorts of atrial EP. These innovations include: (i) automated multi-scale generation of volumetric biatrial models with detailed anatomical structures and fiber architecture; (ii) a robust method for defining space-varying atrial parameter fields; (iii) a parametric approach for modeling inter-atrial conduction pathways; and (iv) an efficient forward EP model for high-fidelity electrocardiogram computation. We evaluated this workflow on a cohort of 50 atrial fibrillation patients, producing high-quality meshes suitable for reaction-eikonal and reaction-diffusion models and demonstrating the ability to simulate atrial ECGs under parametrically controlled conditions. These advancements represent a critical step toward scalable, precise, and clinically applicable digital twin models and virtual cohorts, enabling enhanced patient-specific predictions and therapeutic planning.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents a novel end-to-end computational framework for generating high-fidelity volumetric models of human atrial electrophysiology (EP) calibrated by electrocardiogram (ECG) data. The framework overcomes existing limitations in fidelity and scalability found in current state-of-the-art methods, which hinder the creation of effective virtual cohorts and patient-specific digital twins. Key innovations include: 1. Automated multi-scale generation of detailed biatrial anatomical models. 2. A robust method for defining varying atrial parameter fields. 3. A parametric approach to modeling inter-atrial conduction pathways. 4. An efficient forward EP model for generating accurate ECG simulations. The framework was validated using data from 50 patients with atrial fibrillation and effectively produced high-quality meshes for subsequent models. This research marks significant progress toward scalable digital twins and virtual cohorts in clinical settings, enhancing individualized patient predictions and therapy planning. ### Critical Evaluation: The paper makes notable contributions by addressing crucial challenges in the development of computational models for atrial electrophysiology. The strengths of the research lie in its integration of multiple methodologies to streamline the generation of anatomically accurate models, an aspect often overlooked in earlier studies. The validation with a substantial cohort of patients is also a strong point, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed methodology in a clinically relevant context. However, there are weaknesses that warrant attention. While the authors propose an automated workflow, the paper lacks detailed comparisons with existing methods, making it difficult to gauge the relative improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the complex methodology, while innovative, may impose a steep learning curve for widespread adoption among clinicians who are not specialists in computational modeling. Without broader validation across diverse patient populations and conditions, questions remain regarding the generalizability of the results. In terms of impact, the framework's ability to produce high-quality models addresses significant gaps in the field, suggesting a promising avenue for enhanced clinical applications. However, the incorporation of practical use cases and interoperability with existing clinical practices would strengthen its potential influence. Given these considerations, I assign a score of **7**. This score reflects the paper's significant novelty and potential impact, tempered by concerns regarding relative performance comparison, accessibility for clinical users, and the necessity for broader validation.

- **Authors**: Momin Abbas, Muneeza Azmat, Raya Horesh, Mikhail Yurochkin
- **Abstract**: Distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for reliable deployment of classification systems. However, OOD data is typically unavailable or difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge for accurate OOD detection. In this work, we present a method that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create high-quality synthetic OOD proxies, eliminating the dependency on any external OOD data source. We study the efficacy of our method on classical text classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification as well as classification tasks arising in LLM development and deployment, such as training a reward model for RLHF and detecting misaligned generations. Extensive experiments on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and various model sizes show that our approach dramatically lowers false positive rates (achieving a perfect zero in some cases) while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution tasks, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Out-of-Distribution Detection using Synthetic Data Generation" addresses the challenge of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs in classification systems, which is critical for ensuring reliable model performance. The authors propose a novel method that leverages the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce high-quality synthetic OOD data, thus removing the need for inaccessible external OOD datasets. The efficacy of this approach is tested across various text classification tasks, including toxicity detection and sentiment classification, as well as specific applications in LLM development like reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and detecting misaligned outputs. The results from extensive experiments on nine In-Distribution (InD) and OOD dataset pairs indicate that the proposed method significantly reduces false positive rates—achieving perfect results in some scenarios—while preserving high accuracy on InD tasks. This performance surpasses existing baseline methods. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty and Comprehensiveness**: The use of synthetic data generation through LLMs for OOD detection is innovative, as it directly addresses the scarcity of OOD datasets, which is a significant obstacle in machine learning deployment. Previous works often relied on manually curated datasets or limited sources of OOD examples. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimental setup, involving nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and diverse classification tasks, demonstrates rigorous testing. The paper shows quantitative results that clearly indicate improved performance metrics, reinforcing the validity of the proposed method. 3. **Generality of Application**: The applicability of the method across multiple domains (toxicity detection, sentiment analysis, and LLM deployment scenarios) suggests that it could be a versatile tool for various machine learning applications, hence broadening its potential impact. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Theoretical Insights**: The paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical discussion on the mechanisms by which LLMs can generate effective synthetic OOD samples. While the empirical results are compelling, a clearer understanding of why the generated data works effectively could enhance the contributions. 2. **Dependence on LLM Quality**: The effectiveness of the proposed method is contingent upon the generative quality of LLMs. If advancements in model architecture or training methodologies emerge, the applicability of this approach may necessitate reassessment. 3. **Generalizability**: While the experiments demonstrate favorable outcomes, the methods may need further validation in other domains or tasks to establish robustness beyond the tested scenarios. **Score Justification**: Based on these considerations, the paper offers a significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel technique that leverages the capabilities of LLMs for OOD detection, coupled with strong empirical validation. Its influence may propel further research into synthetic data generation for various applications in machine learning and provide a baseline for future OOD methodologies. Overall, I assign this paper a score of **8/10**. It displays a commendable level of novelty and empirical support, but it could strengthen its contribution with a better theoretical framework and expansive validation across more diverse tasks and contexts. **Score: 8**

### ECM: A Unified Electronic Circuit Model for Explaining the Emergence of In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought in Large Language Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03325v1)
- **Authors**: Qiguang Chen, Libo Qin, Jinhao Liu, Dengyun Peng, Jiaqi Wang, Mengkang Hu, Zhi Chen, Wanxiang Che, Ting Liu
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to significant successes across various applications, where the most noticeable is to a series of emerging capabilities, particularly in the areas of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). To better understand and control model performance, many studies have begun investigating the underlying causes of these phenomena and their impact on task outcomes. However, existing explanatory frameworks predominantly focus on isolating and explaining ICL and CoT independently, leading to an incomplete understanding of their combined influence on model performance. To address this gap, we propose the Electronic Circuit Model (ECM), which provides a foundation for developing scalable, learnable policies and improving the management of AI-generated content. Specifically, ECM conceptualizes model behavior as an electronic circuit: ICL is represented as semantic magnetic field to providing an additional voltage following Faraday's Law, while CoT is modeled as series resistors to constrain the model output performance following Ohm's Law. Experimental results demonstrate that the ECM effectively predicts and explains LLM performance across a variety of prompting strategies. Furthermore, we apply ECM to advanced reasoning strategy optimization on a series of tasks, such as the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) and the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), achieving competitive performance that surpasses nearly 80% of top human competitors.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Electronic Circuit Model (ECM) as a unified framework to explain the phenomena of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs). By likening model behavior to an electronic circuit, ECM conceptualizes ICL as a "semantic magnetic field" that provides voltage analogous to Faraday's Law, while modeling CoT as series resistors in accordance with Ohm's Law. This model aims to enhance the understanding of how ICL and CoT interplay, which is often overlooked in existing studies that treat them separately. The authors demonstrate that ECM can effectively predict LLM performance across different prompting strategies, applying it to optimize reasoning strategies in competitions like the IOI and IMO, where LLM performance surpasses 80% of top human competitors. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the ECM model lies in its integrative approach to explain ICL and CoT, which have traditionally been studied in isolation. By framing these phenomena within an electronic circuit analogy, the authors provide a fresh perspective that could foster further research focused on the interdependencies of model behaviors. Additionally, the practical application of ECM to optimize reasoning strategies showcases its potential impact on real-world tasks, bridging theoretical insights with tangible advancements in LLM capabilities. However, while the electronic circuit analogy is innovative, it may oversimplify complex neural behavior, risking the loss of nuances inherent in LLM operations. The authors could further strengthen their claims by exploring potential limitations or conditions under which ECM may not apply, as well as contrasting results in diverse LLM architectures beyond those tested. The empirical validation is promising; however, additional datasets or tasks could enhance credibility. The results are competitive and indicate significant advancements, yet it is crucial to recognize that the field of LLMs is evolving rapidly, and many approaches contribute to performance improvements. The impact of ECM may become clearer as it is tested across various LLMs and configurations beyond those discussed. Overall, the paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the understanding of LLM performance dynamics, with practical applications that could set the stage for subsequent research. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and practical implications while acknowledging areas for refinement and the need for broader validation of the proposed model.

### Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03327v1)
- **Authors**: Anastasis Kratsios, Takashi Furuya
- **Abstract**: The success of transformers is often linked to their ability to perform in-context learning. Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context" explores the concept of in-context learning, which has been posited as a key feature of transformer models. The authors investigate whether the "in-context universality" of transformers—defined as their ability to approximate any real-valued continuous function associated with a context and a query—can sufficiently explain their superior performance over traditional models. The authors present a novel finding that Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with trainable activation functions also exhibit this universal in-context property. This conclusion suggests that the advantages of transformers may stem from other aspects, such as their inductive biases or the stability afforded during training, rather than solely from their in-context learning capabilities. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces a noteworthy argument by demonstrating that MLPs can achieve in-context universality, challenging the notion that this property is unique to transformer models. This finding is significant because it redirects the focus toward other elements that contribute to the performance of different architectures, prompting further exploration into inductive biases and training methodologies. Strengths: 1. **Novel Contribution:** The analysis providing an equivalence in in-context universality between MLPs and transformers adds depth to the understanding of model capabilities. 2. **Stimulates Further Research:** By questioning the supremacy of transformers based solely on in-context learning, the paper opens avenues for further research into alternative architectures and their potential advantages. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Practical Implications:** While the theoretical results are interesting, the practical implications of these findings in current applications might not be immediately clear. The exploration of inductive biases and training stability without providing specific frameworks or guidelines may leave a gap in actionable insights. 2. **Narrow Focus:** The paper predominantly engages with theoretical analysis, which could detract from its applicability in practical real-world scenarios, where a diverse array of factors influence model performance. Overall, this paper contributes to the discourse on model architecture and performance analytics, enriching the understanding of both transformers and MLPs. However, the scope of practical applications arising from the theoretical findings is somewhat limited. Therefore, while the paper is impactful, its long-term significance may be contingent upon follow-up studies that translate these insights into operational frameworks. **Score: 7**   The score reflects a significant contribution to understanding model capabilities but acknowledges the limitations in practical implications and applicability within the dynamic field of machine learning.

### A Mixture-Based Framework for Guiding Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03332v1)
- **Authors**: Yazid Janati, Badr Moufad, Mehdi Abou El Qassime, Alain Durmus, Eric Moulines, Jimmy Olsson
- **Abstract**: Denoising diffusion models have driven significant progress in the field of Bayesian inverse problems. Recent approaches use pre-trained diffusion models as priors to solve a wide range of such problems, only leveraging inference-time compute and thereby eliminating the need to retrain task-specific models on the same dataset. To approximate the posterior of a Bayesian inverse problem, a diffusion model samples from a sequence of intermediate posterior distributions, each with an intractable likelihood function. This work proposes a novel mixture approximation of these intermediate distributions. Since direct gradient-based sampling of these mixtures is infeasible due to intractable terms, we propose a practical method based on Gibbs sampling. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on image inverse problems, utilizing both pixel- and latent-space diffusion priors, as well as on source separation with an audio diffusion model. The code is available at https://www.github.com/badr-moufad/mgdm
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "A Mixture-Based Framework for Guiding Diffusion Models" addresses the use of denoising diffusion models in Bayesian inverse problems by proposing a new mixture approximation approach for the intermediate posterior distributions, which is crucial for efficient sampling and posterior approximation in such problems. The authors recognize that using pre-trained diffusion models as priors during inference can simplify the process of solving various tasks without the need for retraining models on specific datasets. However, the challenge presented by intractable likelihood functions in sampling from these intermediate distributions is tackled using Gibbs sampling, which is offered as a practical alternative. The authors evaluate their method through experiments on image inverse problems and source separation tasks using both pixel- and latent-space diffusion priors, providing empirical support for the effectiveness of their approach. The code for implementing their method is made publicly available. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Novelty:**     The introduction of a mixture-based approach to approximate intractable intermediate posterior distributions in denoising diffusion models contributes a fresh perspective to the field of Bayesian inference. Although the general concept of using pre-trained models has been explored, the specific implementation of a Gibbs sampling framework paired with a mixture approximation appears novel and addresses existing limitations in gradient-based methods. This approach has the potential to make the sampling process more tractable and efficient. 2. **Technical Rigor:**    The paper demonstrates a methodological sophistication through the application of Gibbs sampling—a well-known technique in Bayesian statistics—tailored for their specific problem formulation. However, the execution and mathematical justification for the mixture model are not deeply scrutinized, leaving some gaps in understanding how well the proposed method scales or generalizes across other applications. 3. **Experimental Validation:**    The extensive experiments conducted on image inverse problems and source separation bolster the practical relevance of the proposed framework. Nonetheless, the paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of results, such as insights into the trade-offs involved when using pixel-space versus latent-space diffusion priors. Additionally, comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods can further strengthen the claims of superiority or practicality. 4. **Potential Impact:**    The research could significantly influence practices in Bayesian inverse problems, particularly in applications where retraining models is infeasible due to time or resource constraints. By providing a framework that leverages existing diffusion models and simplifies the inference process, the potential for broader adoption and experimentation in real-world tasks is high. 5. **Weaknesses:**    One major concern is that while the framework presents an interesting approach, the implementation might be limited by the complexity of Gibbs sampling in high-dimensional spaces. Additionally, the reliance on pre-trained models may limit applicability in scenarios where such models are not available or where the training datasets differ significantly. Considering these aspects, the paper demonstrates clear innovation and contributes to an ongoing dialogue within the field, however, some areas for improvement are evident. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the combination of the paper's novel contributions, practical validation, and its thoughtful approach to existing challenges, balanced by a recognition of its limitations in terms of experimental depth and potential general applicability. The framework provided in the paper holds promise for advancing the field, yet further exploration and stronger comparative analysis would enhance its impact.

- **Authors**: Chunwei Liu, Gerardo Vitagliano, Brandon Rose, Matt Prinz, David Andrew Samson, Michael Cafarella
- **Abstract**: Thanks to the advances in generative architectures and large language models, data scientists can now code pipelines of machine-learning operations to process large collections of unstructured data. Recent progress has seen the rise of declarative AI frameworks (e.g., Palimpzest, Lotus, and DocETL) to build optimized and increasingly complex pipelines, but these systems often remain accessible only to expert programmers. In this demonstration, we present PalimpChat, a chat-based interface to Palimpzest that bridges this gap by letting users create and run sophisticated AI pipelines through natural language alone. By integrating Archytas, a ReAct-based reasoning agent, and Palimpzest's suite of relational and LLM-based operators, PalimpChat provides a practical illustration of how a chat interface can make declarative AI frameworks truly accessible to non-experts. Our demo system is publicly available online. At SIGMOD'25, participants can explore three real-world scenarios--scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search--or apply PalimpChat to their own datasets. In this paper, we focus on how PalimpChat, supported by the Palimpzest optimizer, simplifies complex AI workflows such as extracting and analyzing biomedical data.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces PalimpChat, an innovative chat-based interface designed for the declarative AI framework Palimpzest. It aims to make sophisticated AI pipelines more accessible to non-experts by allowing users to interact with the system using natural language. The framework leverages advances in generative architectures and large language models to facilitate the creation and execution of complex machine-learning operations. The demonstration of PalimpChat showcases its potential in three real-world scenarios: scientific discovery, legal discovery, and real estate search, and allows users to apply it to their own datasets. The integration of Archytas provides reasoning capabilities, enhancing the user experience and workflow simplification for tasks such as extracting and analyzing biomedical data. **Rigorous Evaluation:** The paper presents a notable contribution to the field of AI analytics by directly addressing the accessibility issue that often hampers the implementation of declarative AI frameworks among non-experts. PalimpChat’s unique approach of using a conversational interface to interact with such complex systems is a fresh perspective that harnesses the strengths of language models while reducing barriers to entry for users lacking programming expertise. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Interface**: The chat-based interaction model is a significant advancement, as it transforms user experience and allows for a more intuitive approach to complex data processing tasks. 2. **Real-World Applications**: The paper outlines concrete scenarios where the system can be applied, demonstrating its practicality and relevance. 3. **Integration of Technologies**: The combination of Archytas and Palimpzest highlights a thoughtful integration of reasoning and optimization capabilities, further enhancing usability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope in Testing**: While three use cases are presented, the evaluation may benefit from a more expansive testing pool to solidify claims regarding versatility and robustness. 2. **User Feedback**: The paper lacks detailed user feedback or qualitative data on the effectiveness of PalimpChat after real-world use, which could provide better insights into usability. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: There is limited discussion on how PalimpChat compares with existing declarative frameworks in terms of performance, accessibility, and user satisfaction. **Conclusion**: Overall, while the paper presents significant advancements and innovative applications, it would benefit from more comprehensive testing and user feedback to substantiate its claims of improved accessibility. The novelty mainly stems from its conversational approach, which could alter how non-programmers engage with AI frameworks. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper’s noteworthy contributions and innovative approach while recognizing areas that require further empirical validation and exploration.

### Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03373v1)
- **Authors**: Edward Yeo, Yuxuan Tong, Morry Niu, Graham Neubig, Xiang Yue
- **Abstract**: Scaling inference compute enhances reasoning in large language models (LLMs), with long chains-of-thought (CoTs) enabling strategies like backtracking and error correction. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial method for developing these capabilities, yet the conditions under which long CoTs emerge remain unclear, and RL training requires careful design choices. In this study, we systematically investigate the mechanics of long CoT reasoning, identifying the key factors that enable models to generate long CoT trajectories. Through extensive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL experiments, we present four main findings: (1) While SFT is not strictly necessary, it simplifies training and improves efficiency; (2) Reasoning capabilities tend to emerge with increased training compute, but their development is not guaranteed, making reward shaping crucial for stabilizing CoT length growth; (3) Scaling verifiable reward signals is critical for RL. We find that leveraging noisy, web-extracted solutions with filtering mechanisms shows strong potential, particularly for out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks such as STEM reasoning; and (4) Core abilities like error correction are inherently present in base models, but incentivizing these skills effectively for complex tasks via RL demands significant compute, and measuring their emergence requires a nuanced approach. These insights provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/eddycmu/demystify-long-cot.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Demystifying Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in LLMs" addresses the complexity of enabling long chains-of-thought (CoTs) in large language models (LLMs). It highlights how increased inference compute can lead to improved reasoning capabilities, particularly through methods like backtracking and error correction. The authors conduct a systematic investigation into the factors aiding the generation of long CoT trajectories, utilizing both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) in their experiments. The study presents four critical findings:  1. SFT is beneficial for training efficiency, although not strictly necessary. 2. While reasoning capabilities often grow with increased training compute, this is not guaranteed, thus the shaping of rewards is crucial to stabilize the length of CoTs. 3. The effective scaling of reward signals is essential for successful RL training, with evidence that filtering noisy, web-based solutions presents a robust approach, especially for out-of-distribution tasks like STEM reasoning. 4. Fundamental abilities such as error correction exist within base models, but effectively incentivizing their use for complex tasks through RL demands significant computational resources and a sophisticated evaluation of their emergence. The authors provide practical guidance for optimizing training strategies to enhance long CoT reasoning in LLMs, with accompanying code available on GitHub. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The paper presents several important contributions to the understanding of long CoT reasoning in LLMs, particularly in the context of RL and SFT methodologies.  **Strengths:** - The systematic approach taken by the authors, with detailed empirical investigations, is a valuable addition to the field, providing a robust foundation for future research on LLM reasoning capabilities. - The findings related to the interplay between training compute, reward shaping, and the effectiveness of noise-filtered reward signals are insightful, presenting practical implications for the design of training protocols in LLM applications. - It addresses a real gap in the literature regarding the conditions necessary for long CoT emergence and offers actionable recommendations for researchers and practitioners. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper identifies important factors influencing CoT reasoning, the generalizability of the findings could be a concern. The specific conditions and environments under which these emergent properties manifest may not widely apply across varied LLM architectures or tasks. - There is a lack of exploration regarding alternative methods to RL that could also enhance CoT reasoning, which might limit the perceived scope of the paper’s findings. - Some aspects of the methodology, such as the specifics of the filtering mechanisms for noisy solutions, could benefit from further elaboration to ensure replicability and understanding by other researchers. Considering these points, the framework provided by this study does indeed advance the field and encourages more disciplined methods to tackle CoT reasoning challenges in LLMs. However, the limitations on generalizability and scope detract slightly from the overall impact of the paper. ### Score Score: 8

### Transformers and Their Roles as Time Series Foundation Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03383v1)
- **Authors**: Dennis Wu, Yihan He, Yuan Cao, Jianqing Fan, Han Liu
- **Abstract**: We give a comprehensive analysis of transformers as time series foundation models, focusing on their approximation and generalization capabilities. First, we demonstrate that there exist transformers that fit an autoregressive model on input univariate time series via gradient descent. We then analyze MOIRAI, a multivariate time series foundation model capable of handling an arbitrary number of covariates. We prove that it is capable of automatically fitting autoregressive models with an arbitrary number of covariates, offering insights into its design and empirical success. For generalization, we establish bounds for pretraining when the data satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Experiments support our theoretical findings, highlighting the efficacy of transformers as time series foundation models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "Transformers and Their Roles as Time Series Foundation Models" presents a thorough examination of the application of transformers as foundational models for time series analysis. It highlights their capabilities in approximation and generalization, specifically focusing on two main components:  1. The demonstration of certain transformer architectures that can fit autoregressive models to univariate time series data through gradient descent. 2. The introduction of MOIRAI, a novel multivariate time series foundation model, which can automatically fit autoregressive models involving multiple covariates. The authors provide theoretical backing for MOIRAI's effectiveness and generalization by establishing bounds for pretraining based on Dobrushin's condition. Empirical results are presented that showcase the ability of transformers to serve as competent models in time series forecasting tasks. ### Evaluation: The novelty of this paper lies in its specific application of transformer models within the realm of time series forecasting, an area that is gaining traction due to the increasing importance of time-series data across multiple domains. The identification of both univariate and multivariate capabilities is particularly significant, given the complex nature of many real-world datasets where multiple covariates are involved.  Moreover, the theoretical contributions—especially regarding the guarantees on generalization through Dobrushin's condition—add a rigorous foundation to the practical findings. These insights effectively bridge the gap between theory and practice, demonstrating the robustness of transformer models in modeling time series data. However, while the foundational work and theoretical contributions are solid, the paper may lack breadth in terms of comparative evaluation against traditional time series models or other modern methodologies (like recurrent neural networks). A deeper exploration of the limitations of the approach or potential challenges in its application in practice would lend additional strength to its argument. In conclusion, this work offers important contributions to the intersection of deep learning and time series analysis, specifically through the lens of transformer models. It enhances understanding of how these models can be leveraged, but further comparative studies and explorations of their limitations are needed for a holistic view of their role in the field. **Score: 8**

### LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387v1)
- **Authors**: Yixin Ye, Zhen Huang, Yang Xiao, Ethan Chern, Shijie Xia, Pengfei Liu
- **Abstract**: We present a fundamental discovery that challenges our understanding of how complex reasoning emerges in large language models. While conventional wisdom suggests that sophisticated reasoning tasks demand extensive training data (>100,000 examples), we demonstrate that complex mathematical reasoning abilities can be effectively elicited with surprisingly few examples. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed model LIMO demonstrates unprecedented performance in mathematical reasoning. With merely 817 curated training samples, LIMO achieves 57.1% accuracy on AIME and 94.8% on MATH, improving from previous SFT-based models' 6.5% and 59.2% respectively, while only using 1% of the training data required by previous approaches. LIMO demonstrates exceptional out-of-distribution generalization, achieving 40.5% absolute improvement across 10 diverse benchmarks, outperforming models trained on 100x more data, challenging the notion that SFT leads to memorization rather than generalization. Based on these results, we propose the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis): In foundation models where domain knowledge has been comprehensively encoded during pre-training, sophisticated reasoning capabilities can emerge through minimal but precisely orchestrated demonstrations of cognitive processes. This hypothesis posits that the elicitation threshold for complex reasoning is determined by two key factors: (1) the completeness of the model's encoded knowledge foundation during pre-training, and (2) the effectiveness of post-training examples as "cognitive templates" that show the model how to utilize its knowledge base to solve complex reasoning tasks. To facilitate reproducibility and future research in data-efficient reasoning, we release LIMO as a comprehensive open-source suite at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMO.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning" presents a novel model named LIMO that challenges the conventional belief that extensive training data is necessary for complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The authors argue that sophisticated reasoning capabilities can be achieved using significantly fewer training samples, specifically citing success with only 817 curated examples. The performance of LIMO in mathematical reasoning tasks shows a remarkable improvement, achieving 57.1% accuracy on the AIME dataset and 94.8% on the MATH dataset compared to previous models that required over 100,000 examples and had accuracies of 6.5% and 59.2%, respectively. LIMO also demonstrates outstanding out-of-distribution generalization, significantly outperforming data-rich models by 40.5% across various benchmarks. The paper introduces the Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis (LIMO Hypothesis), which posits that effective reasoning in foundation models can be achieved with limited but instructional examples, contingent on the model's prior knowledge from pre-training and the quality of post-training examples. The authors provide an open-source suite for LIMO to promote reproducibility and further investigations. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation The novelty of this paper lies in its counterintuitive findings that challenge long-held assumptions about the data requirements for training models capable of complex reasoning. The clarity of LIMO's hypothesis, along with the empirical results showing high accuracy with minimal data, presents a compelling argument for re-evaluating training strategies in the field of NLP. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper presents a unique perspective that proposes that the depth of pre-training knowledge can reduce the need for large datasets, thereby influencing future research directions in data-efficient training methodologies. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The results are backed by a comprehensive set of experiments, showcasing significant improvements over traditional models based on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT). 3. **Generalization Capabilities:** Demonstrating out-of-distribution generalization supports the argument that LIMO can encapsulate a broader range of reasoning tasks with lesser examples, indicating a more robust model. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While LIMO shows impressive results in mathematical reasoning, it is uncertain whether the findings are transferable to other complex reasoning tasks or domains. The focus on mathematical reasoning may narrow the model's perceived versatility. 2. **Replicability Concerns:** Although the authors released an open-source implementation, the real-world effectiveness of the findings depends on reproducibility across diverse datasets and scenarios, which has yet to be thoroughly tested in the community. 3. **Model Complexity:** Further analysis of LIMO's architecture, particularly regarding how it constructs cognitive templates, could enhance understanding but is somewhat limited in the current presentation. ### Conclusion Overall, this paper introduces an intriguing claim and results that are likely to reshape perspectives on training methodologies in NLP.

- **Authors**: Hongli Zhan, Muneeza Azmat, Raya Horesh, Junyi Jessy Li, Mikhail Yurochkin
- **Abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models to integrate and reflect human values, especially for tasks that demand intricate human oversight, is arduous since it is resource-intensive and time-consuming to depend on human expertise for context-specific guidance. Prior work has utilized predefined sets of rules or principles to steer the behavior of models (Bai et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). However, these principles tend to be generic, making it challenging to adapt them to each individual input query or context. In this work, we present Situated-PRInciples (SPRI), a framework requiring minimal or no human effort that is designed to automatically generate guiding principles in real-time for each input query and utilize them to align each response. We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness. We release our code and model generations at https://github.com/honglizhan/SPRI-public.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces Situated-PRInciples (SPRI), a novel framework aimed at aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with context-specific human values. Given the challenges of incorporating human oversight due to resource intensity, SPRI automates the generation of guiding principles tailored to each unique input query without relying heavily on human input. The authors demonstrate through their evaluations that SPRI can produce effective, domain-specific principles, rivaling those devised by experts. Furthermore, these instance-specific guidelines surpass prior models based on LLMs for judging tasks. The authors also highlight the promise of using SPRI-generated principles to enhance synthetic supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data, specifically improving factual correctness. The paper concludes with a commitment to transparency by releasing its code and model resources publicly. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Automation**: SPRI represents a significant advancement over conventional full reliance on expert human guidance by enabling real-time generation of appropriate principles, which could streamline the process of aligning LLMs with human-centric values across varied contexts.     2. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides empirical results demonstrating that SPRI can equal or exceed the performance of expert-driven principles in domain-specific tasks, thus validating its effectiveness in practical applications. 3. **Broad Impact Potential**: By addressing a widespread challenge in AI alignment, the framework has the potential to not only improve specific LLM applications but also influence broader research regarding automated guidance systems in AI. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of Findings**: While SPRI claims significant improvements in specific evaluated contexts, the extent to which these results generalize across diverse application areas remains unclear. The paper would benefit from addressing other domains not covered in the evaluation.  2. **Dependence on Context**: Although designed to be context-sensitive, the success of SPRI heavily relies on its ability to contextualize principles effectively. There may be inherent limitations in cases where context is ambiguous or not well-defined. 3. **Potential Ethical Concerns**: The deployment of automated guiding principles raises questions regarding accountability and oversight, particularly in sensitive contexts. This aspect may warrant more discussion in terms of ethical implications and safeguards. **Conclusion**: Overall, SPRI marks a noteworthy stride in the endeavor to align AI with human values through contextual automation. Despite certain limitations in generalizability and ethical considerations, the framework's innovative approach and solid empirical backing lend it considerable importance within the field. ### Score: 8 This score reflects a strong contribution to the ongoing discourse in AI alignment, particularly in advancing automated principles. However, the limitations in generalizability and the need for more thorough exploration of ethical implications temper the excellence and wide-ranging applicability of the work.

- **Abstract**: We present LiGR, a large-scale ranking framework developed at LinkedIn that brings state-of-the-art transformer-based modeling architectures into production. We introduce a modified transformer architecture that incorporates learned normalization and simultaneous set-wise attention to user history and ranked items. This architecture enables several breakthrough achievements, including: (1) the deprecation of most manually designed feature engineering, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art system using only few features (compared to hundreds in the baseline), (2) validation of the scaling law for ranking systems, showing improved performance with larger models, more training data, and longer context sequences, and (3) simultaneous joint scoring of items in a set-wise manner, leading to automated improvements in diversity. To enable efficient serving of large ranking models, we describe techniques to scale inference effectively using single-pass processing of user history and set-wise attention. We also summarize key insights from various ablation studies and A/B tests, highlighting the most impactful technical approaches.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "From Features to Transformers: Redefining Ranking for Scalable Impact" introduces LiGR, a large-scale ranking framework implemented at LinkedIn that integrates cutting-edge transformer-based architectures into production environments. The key innovations of LiGR include a modified transformer architecture that employs learned normalization and a set-wise attention mechanism to process user history along with ranked items.

The introduction of a framework that minimizes manual feature engineering while maximizing model performance marks a critical evolution in the field, particularly for practical applications in online platforms.  Its exploration of scaling laws and the ability to enhance diversity through joint scoring methodologies also contribute valuable findings relevant to machine learning and recommendation systems. In doing so, it addresses common bottlenecks in ranking systems, advancing both academic understanding and practical implementation. **Strengths:** - The innovation in applying transformer architectures to ranking tasks represents a pioneering approach with potential implications for future system design. - The reduction of manual feature engineering could lead to a paradigm shift in how ranking systems are constructed, promoting efficiency. - The emphasis on scaling and performance validation deepens the research community's understanding of implementing large-scale models in real-world contexts. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper demonstrates practical effectiveness, it may lack thorough exploration of limitations, such as computational costs or the robustness of the model under varying conditions. - There is a need for more detailed comparative analysis against competing methods beyond the primary baseline to justify the claims fully. - The reliance on specific case studies from LinkedIn may hinder generalizability across different domains or applications. **Conclusion:** While the paper presents significant advancements and practical contributions, its impact is somewhat tempered by a lack of broader contextualization and detailed comparative analysis. Nevertheless, it does mark an important step in the evolution of ranking systems. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, especially in integrating advanced architectures into established systems and emphasizing practical application and scalability. However, the areas for improvement indicate that while the work is robust, there's room for deeper exploration of its implications and limitations.

- **Authors**: Nikta Gohari Sadr, Sangmitra Madhusudan, Ali Emami
- **Abstract**: Zero-shot prompting techniques have significantly improved the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we lack a clear understanding of why zero-shot prompts are so effective. For example, in the prompt "Let's think step-by-step," is "think" or "step-by-step" more crucial to its success? Existing interpretability methods, such as gradient-based and attention-based approaches, are computationally intensive and restricted to open-source models. We introduce the ZIP score (Zero-shot Importance of Perturbation score), a versatile metric applicable to both open and closed-source models, based on systematic input word perturbations. Our experiments across four recent LLMs, seven widely-used prompts, and several tasks, reveal interesting patterns in word importance. For instance, while both 'step-by-step' and 'think' show high ZIP scores, which one is more influential depends on the model and task. We validate our method using controlled experiments and compare our results with human judgments, finding that proprietary models align more closely with human intuition regarding word significance. These findings enhance our understanding of LLM behavior and contribute to developing more effective zero-shot prompts and improved model analysis.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Think or Step-by-Step? UnZIPping the Black Box in Zero-Shot Prompts" investigates the effectiveness of zero-shot prompting techniques in Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduces a new metric called the ZIP score to analyze the importance of individual words in prompts. The authors perform systematic perturbation analysis to evaluate how specific words contribute to the success of prompts across various models, prompting tasks, and common phrases. Their findings indicate that the influence of these words varies significantly depending on both the model and specific task, with both ‘think’ and ‘step-by-step’ showing high importance scores. Notably, the results align more closely with human intuition in proprietary models compared to open-source ones. This work aims to enhance the analysis of LLM behavior and provide insights for creating more effective zero-shot prompts. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its introduction of the ZIP score, which presents a new approach to evaluating the importance of words in zero-shot prompting without the heavy computational demands of existing methods. This contribution is significant as it aids in demystifying the factors that contribute to the performance of LLMs and addresses a pressing concern in the field regarding interpretability. Strengths of the paper include the novel metric that encompasses both open and closed-source models, comprehensive experimental validation, and comparison with human judgments. These aspects increase the robustness and applicability of the findings across different contexts and models. However, the paper could be critiqued on a couple of fronts. Firstly, although it offers a new perspective on zero-shot prompts, it doesn't delve deeply into the underlying mechanics or theoretical implications of why certain words affect performance more than others—this may leave a gap in understanding the broader impacts of their findings. Secondly, while the use of human judgments for validation is commendable, the scope and methodology of these comparisons need to be better detailed to evaluate their reliability fully. Overall, the approach taken by the authors helps advance our understanding of prompt engineering in LLMs and opens up avenues for further research into model interpretability. Treading carefully with the limitations noted, I assess this paper's contribution to the field as considerable but not without room for improvement in terms of depth and theory. **Score: 8**

### Harnessing Large Language Models for Curated Code Reviews
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03425v1)
- **Authors**: Oussama Ben Sghaier, Martin Weyssow, Houari Sahraoui
- **Abstract**: In code review, generating structured and relevant comments is crucial for identifying code issues and facilitating accurate code changes that ensure an efficient code review process. Well-crafted comments not only streamline the code review itself but are also essential for subsequent tasks like code refinement, where the code is modified to satisfy the input review comment. Although various AI-based approaches aimed to automate comment generation, their effectiveness remains limited by the quality of the training data. Existing code review datasets are often noisy and unrefined, posing limitations to the learning potential of AI models and hindering the automation process. To address these challenges, we propose a curation pipeline designed to enhance the quality of the largest publicly available code review dataset. We begin by establishing an evaluation framework, incorporating specific criteria and categories to empirically study the initial quality of the dataset. Using a large language model (LLM)-driven approach, we then apply our curation pipeline to refine the dataset. A comparative analysis of the newly curated dataset, based on the same evaluation framework, demonstrates substantial improvements in the clarity and conciseness of the comments. Additionally, we assess the impact of the curated dataset on automating downstream tasks, specifically comment generation and code refinement. Our findings show that the curated dataset leads to enhanced model performance in generating more accurate comments. Curated comments are also more useful as they lead to more accurate code refinement.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a method for improving the quality of code review comments generated by AI, particularly through the use of a curated code review dataset that addresses the issues found in existing datasets, which are often noisy. By developing a curation pipeline utilizing large language models (LLMs), the authors apply an evaluation framework to enhance comment clarity and conciseness. Their comparative analysis shows that comments from the newly curated dataset significantly improve the performance of models in generating accurate feedback and facilitating effective code refinement. The findings underscore the importance of high-quality training data in automating the code review process. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces a notable contribution to the field of automated code review by addressing a critical limitation: the quality of training data. The novelty lies in the dual approach of curating a dataset while simultaneously providing a structured evaluation framework. This emphasis on quality over quantity is an essential step forward in the field, as it not only enhances the immediate functionality of AI in code reviews but also lays groundwork for future research in the area. However, the work does exhibit some weaknesses. First, while the curation pipeline is a significant improvement, the paper could have included a more in-depth discussion about the specific categories and criteria used in their evaluation framework to ensure replicability and transparency. Moreover, while the focus is on the improvements in comment generation and code refinement, the paper lacks a broader perspective on how it may influence other areas of software engineering or its adoption challenges in real-world scenarios. On the whole, the paper is likely to impact the field positively by providing a practical solution for enhancing AI-driven code review systems, especially for practitioners looking to improve the efficacy of their code review processes. The integration of a well-curated dataset in AI systems can serve as a reference point for future research, thus fostering advancements in the field. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to data curation and AI methodology in code reviews coupled with the recognition of its limitations in terms of broader implications and methodological transparency.

### TruePose: Human-Parsing-guided Attention Diffusion for Full-ID Preserving Pose Transfer
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03426v1)
- **Authors**: Zhihong Xu, Dongxia Wang, Peng Du, Yang Cao, Qing Guo
- **Abstract**: Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates images that maintain a subject's identity from a source image while adopting a specified target pose (e.g., skeleton). While diffusion-based PGPIS methods effectively preserve facial features during pose transformation, they often struggle to accurately maintain clothing details from the source image throughout the diffusion process. This limitation becomes particularly problematic when there is a substantial difference between the source and target poses, significantly impacting PGPIS applications in the fashion industry where clothing style preservation is crucial for copyright protection. Our analysis reveals that this limitation primarily stems from the conditional diffusion model's attention modules failing to adequately capture and preserve clothing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose human-parsing-guided attention diffusion, a novel approach that effectively preserves both facial and clothing appearance while generating high-quality results. We propose a human-parsing-aware Siamese network that consists of three key components: dual identical UNets (TargetNet for diffusion denoising and SourceNet for source image embedding extraction), a human-parsing-guided fusion attention (HPFA), and a CLIP-guided attention alignment (CAA). The HPFA and CAA modules can embed the face and clothes patterns into the target image generation adaptively and effectively. Extensive experiments on both the in-shop clothes retrieval benchmark and the latest in-the-wild human editing dataset demonstrate our method's significant advantages over 13 baseline approaches for preserving both facial and clothes appearance in the source image.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents "TruePose," a novel framework for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) that addresses the challenge of maintaining both facial features and clothing details during pose transformation. Traditional diffusion-based methods excel at preserving facial characteristics but often fail to retain clothing details when the source and target poses differ significantly. This issue is particularly critical in fashion applications due to copyright concerns. The authors propose a human-parsing-guided attention diffusion strategy, which utilizes a unique Siamese network architecture featuring dual UNets, a human-parsing-guided fusion attention (HPFA) module, and a CLIP-guided attention alignment (CAA) module. These components work together to effectively integrate facial and clothing patterns into the synthesized images. Experimental results demonstrate that TruePose outperforms 13 baseline methods on both a clothes retrieval benchmark and a human editing dataset, highlighting its efficacy in image generation that preserves identity and style. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of TruePose lies in its integrated approach that combines human parsing and attention mechanisms to enhance PGPIS. The identification of the specific problem—failure to capture clothing details in existing models—addresses a tangible gap in the field, particularly relevant to applications in fashion, where style preservation is critical. The proposed architecture, using dual UNets for separate processing of the source image and target pose information, is innovative and provides a solid methodological contribution. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The focus on style preservation in fashion is both pertinent and timely, as the industry is increasingly leveraging AI for visual content generation.  2. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Reporting extensive experimental results against multiple baselines adds credibility to their claims of superiority. 3. **Technical Approach:** The use of advanced techniques like human parsing and attention maps indicates a deep engagement with current methodologies in image synthesis. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Real-World Testing:** While the experiments are thorough, communicating real-world effectiveness—outside controlled datasets—could enhance applicability. 2. **Complexity:** The model's reliance on multiple components (dual UNets, HPFA, CAA) may complicate deployment in practice, raising concerns about computational resources and efficiency. 3. **Broader Applicability:** The paper could expand its discussion on how these methods could be applied beyond the fashion industry, increasing its impact across domains. Overall, the paper contributes significantly to the PGPIS field by addressing relevant challenges with innovative methodologies, backed by substantial empirical evidence. However, its practicality in diverse real-world settings and simplicity of application could be areas for further exploration. **Score: 8**   This score reflects a strong contribution and innovation in the field, with minor concerns about applicability and complexity limiting its impact.

### On Fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Model for Image Generation

- **Authors**: Ming Liu, Hao Chen, Jindong Wang, Liwen Wang, Bhiksha Raj Ramakrishnan, Wensheng Zhang
- **Abstract**: Unified multimodal large language models (U-MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in visual understanding and generation in an end-to-end pipeline. Compared with generation-only models (e.g., Stable Diffusion), U-MLLMs may raise new questions about bias in their outputs, which can be affected by their unified capabilities. This gap is particularly concerning given the under-explored risk of propagating harmful stereotypes. In this paper, we benchmark the latest U-MLLMs and find that most exhibit significant demographic biases, such as gender and race bias. To better understand and mitigate this issue, we propose a locate-then-fix strategy, where we audit and show how the individual model component is affected by bias. Our analysis shows that bias originates primarily from the language model. More interestingly, we observe a "partial alignment" phenomenon in U-MLLMs, where understanding bias appears minimal, but generation bias remains substantial. Thus, we propose a novel balanced preference model to balance the demographic distribution with synthetic data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces demographic bias while preserving semantic fidelity. We hope our findings underscore the need for more holistic interpretation and debiasing strategies of U-MLLMs in the future.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the fairness of Unified Multimodal Large Language Models (U-MLLMs) in image generation, highlighting concerns regarding demographic biases, particularly in gender and race. It benchmarks several U-MLLMs and reveals significant underlying biases, predominantly emanating from the language model component. The authors introduce a "locate-then-fix" strategy to audit these biases, revealing a "partial alignment" phenomenon where bias in understanding is low, but generation bias remains high. They propose a balanced preference model to mitigate demographic bias while maintaining semantic fidelity, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments. The paper emphasizes the need for more nuanced interpretations and strategies to address bias in U-MLLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** 1. **Novelty:**     - The paper addresses a rapidly growing area in AI and machine learning—fairness in AI models, particularly U-MLLMs, which has received limited attention compared to traditional single-modal models. This focus on the intersection of fairness and multimodal generation signifies a valuable contribution. 2. **Significance:**     - Given the expansion of AI applications in sensitive domains (e.g., marketing, media), biases in image generation could have serious implications. The findings underline a crucial need to tackle demographic biases, thus holding significance in both academic research and practical application in industry. 3. **Strengths:**    - The rigorous benchmarking of existing U-MLLMs adds a robust empirical basis to their claims about biases.    - The introduction of the locate-then-fix strategy and the balanced preference model represent new methodologies that can inform future research and applications, enhancing interpretability and mitigation strategies for demographic biases. 4. **Weaknesses:**    - The paper might benefit from a broader scope of demographic factors explored beyond gender and race to include other potential axes such as age, disability, and socioeconomic status.    - While the paper introduces mitigation strategies, it may not delve deeply enough into long-term implications of these strategies or their ethical ramifications when applied in real-world situations. 5. **Potential Influence:**    - The work sets a precedent for future research in bias analysis within multimodal frameworks, potentially influencing model development processes. Its implications for ethical AI use are significant and timely, offering a framework for ongoing discussions about fairness in AI development. Overall, while the paper's proposals and findings are valuable, the critical gaps identified regarding breadth of demographic analysis and depth of ethical considerations slightly detract from its overall impact in the field. However, the introduction of novel methodologies and the timely focus on bias in U-MLLMs still constitutes a noteworthy addition to the literature. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Ran Xin, Chenguang Xi, Jie Yang, Feng Chen, Hang Wu, Xia Xiao, Yifan Sun, Shen Zheng, Kai Shen
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Search (BFS) remains underexplored. This paper investigates whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present \texttt{BFS-Prover}, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. \texttt{BFS-Prover} achieves a score of $71.31$ on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces "BFS-Prover," a framework that leverages Best-First Search (BFS) for large-scale automatic theorem proving, challenging the conventional reliance on more complex methods like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The authors present three main innovations: strategic data filtering to tackle harder problems, enhancing BFS sample efficiency through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using compiler error feedback, and implementing length normalization to foster exploration of deeper proof paths. The results demonstrate that BFS-Prover performs competitively, achieving a score of 71.31 on the MiniF2F test set and suggesting that BFS can be a viable alternative in theorem proving applications. **Evaluation:** The paper presents several strengths: 1. **Novelty:** It addresses an underexplored area by emphasizing the potential of BFS in automatic theorem proving, a domain typically dominated by MCTS and similar methods. This shift in focus could inspire future research into simpler search methods. 2. **Methodological Innovations:** The proposed innovations, particularly data filtering and DPO, could have significant implications for enhancing efficiency and performance in theorem proving contexts, showcasing creativity and a thorough understanding of the challenges in the field. 3. **Empirical Results:** The competitive performance of BFS-Prover on the MiniF2F test set provides a strong empirical basis to support the theoretical arguments presented, lending credibility to the claims of BFS’s effectiveness. However, there are also weaknesses to consider: 1. **Comparison with Other Methods:** While the paper demonstrates that BFS-Prover achieves competitive performance, it lacks extensive comparative analysis with existing state-of-the-art methods, which could clarify its advantages and limitations more definitively. 2. **Scalability Concerns:** The scalability of BFS in various contexts and problems within theorem proving is not thoroughly explored. The potential impact of problem complexity on BFS performance remains to be examined more comprehensively. 3. **Limited Scope of Application:** Focusing primarily on the MiniF2F test set may limit the generalizability of the findings. Expansion to diverse benchmark suites could strengthen claims of robustness. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **7**. This reflects the paper's significant contribution to the field through its novel approach and methodological advancements, though it would benefit from deeper comparative analysis and broader empirical validation. The introduction of BFS as a contender in an area largely associated with more complicated methods is notable, but further research is necessary to fully establish its practicality and scope of application. **Score: 7**

### Masked Autoencoders Are Effective Tokenizers for Diffusion Models

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness for high-resolution image synthesis. However, the properties of the latent space from tokenizer for better learning and generation of diffusion models remain under-explored. Theoretically and empirically, we find that improved generation quality is closely tied to the latent distributions with better structure, such as the ones with fewer Gaussian Mixture modes and more discriminative features. Motivated by these insights, we propose MAETok, an autoencoder (AE) leveraging mask modeling to learn semantically rich latent space while maintaining reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments validate our analysis, demonstrating that the variational form of autoencoders is not necessary, and a discriminative latent space from AE alone enables state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation using only 128 tokens. MAETok achieves significant practical improvements, enabling a gFID of 1.69 with 76x faster training and 31x higher inference throughput for 512x512 generation. Our findings show that the structure of the latent space, rather than variational constraints, is crucial for effective diffusion models. Code and trained models are released.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MAETok, a novel autoencoder (AE) architecture that employs mask modeling to enhance the latent space learning for diffusion models, particularly in high-resolution image generation. It addresses the under-explored effects of the latent space structure on the diffusion models' performance. The authors argue that the quality of generated images is improved by organizing the latent space with fewer Gaussian mixture modes and more discriminative features. Through extensive experimentation, the paper contends that relying solely on a discriminative latent space, as opposed to a variational formulation, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with significantly reduced token usage (128 tokens) and improved efficiency—a 76x training speedup and 31x higher inference throughput for generating images at 512x512 resolution. The study emphasizes the importance of latent space structure over variational constraints for effective diffusion modeling and makes the code and trained models available for further research. **Evaluation of the Paper's Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of MAETok represents a significant shift in perspective regarding the latent space of autoencoders in the context of diffusion models. The focus on mask modeling to achieve semantically rich latent representations is novel and can inspire further research within this domain. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors back their theoretical findings with extensive experiments, providing a strong evidential basis for their claims. Achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet with improved efficiency makes the contributions noticeable. 3. **Practical Implications**: The advancements in training speed and inference throughput could have substantial practical implications for image synthesis applications, enabling faster and more efficient models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Theoretical Explication**: While the empirical results are compelling, the theoretical underpinnings may be less rigorously addressed. A more detailed exploration would strengthen the paper's scientific contributions and connect the dots between latent structure properties and generation quality. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a more extensive comparison with existing models and approaches beyond a focus mainly on parameters like speed and throughput. A broader context could better contextualize the effectiveness of MAETok. 3. **Potential Over-Reliance on Token Count**: Emphasizing a low token count could raise questions about whether this approach sacrifices some aspects of representation quality or model robustness. A discussion of potential trade-offs would be important for providing a balanced view. **Overall Significance**: The paper contributes to a more nuanced understanding of latent space structuring in diffusion models and provides practical tools for researchers and practitioners. The findings may pave the way for future work that explores new autoencoder architectures and latent space strategies in generative modeling. However, while the immediate contributions are significant, the scope and impact could be greater with more comprehensive theoretical backing and contextualization against existing work. **Score**: 8 This score reflects a robust contribution to the field of diffusion models and generative AI. It acknowledges the innovative aspect and practical improvements while also considering the need for deeper theoretical insights and comparative context.

- **Authors**: Xuan Li, Chang Yu, Wenxin Du, Ying Jiang, Tianyi Xie, Yunuo Chen, Yin Yang, Chenfanfu Jiang
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in large models have significantly advanced image-to-3D reconstruction. However, the generated models are often fused into a single piece, limiting their applicability in downstream tasks. This paper focuses on 3D garment generation, a key area for applications like virtual try-on with dynamic garment animations, which require garments to be separable and simulation-ready. We introduce Dress-1-to-3, a novel pipeline that reconstructs physics-plausible, simulation-ready separated garments with sewing patterns and humans from an in-the-wild image. Starting with the image, our approach combines a pre-trained image-to-sewing pattern generation model for creating coarse sewing patterns with a pre-trained multi-view diffusion model to produce multi-view images. The sewing pattern is further refined using a differentiable garment simulator based on the generated multi-view images. Versatile experiments demonstrate that our optimization approach substantially enhances the geometric alignment of the reconstructed 3D garments and humans with the input image.

- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Dress-1-to-3" presents a novel pipeline aimed at generating simulation-ready 3D garments from single images, addressing the limitations of fused models in image-to-3D reconstruction. The proposed method, Dress-1-to-3, combines a pre-trained model for generating coarse sewing patterns and a multi-view diffusion model for creating multi-angle garment images. This is followed by the refinement of the sewing patterns using a differentiable garment simulator. Extensive experiments show that the approach significantly improves the geometric compatibility of generated 3D garments with input images. Additionally, the integration of texture and human motion generation modules allows for realistic simulations and dynamic garment demonstrations.

### A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs)
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03450v1)
- **Authors**: Yiye Chen, Harpreet Sawhney, Nicholas Gydé, Yanan Jian, Jack Saunders, Patricio Vela, Ben Lundell
- **Abstract**: Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval. Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the absence of agent-level demonstrations. Project code will be released.
- **Summary**: **Concise Summary:** The paper proposes a novel framework called SG-RwR (Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason) designed for reasoning and planning using scene graphs in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs). In this framework, two LLM agents work together: one agent, the Reasoner, generates queries based on task planning and spatial reasoning, while the second agent, the Retriever, extracts relevant information from the scene graph based on those queries. This collaboration operates under a schema-based approach that minimizes hallucination issues by limiting input to schema rather than full graph data. The results indicate that SG-RwR outperforms existing LLM-based methods in tasks involving numerical question answering and planning, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness even without extensive agent-level demonstrations. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces an innovative approach by leveraging a schema-guided framework for reasoning about scene graphs, which is a significant advancement in the application of LLMs to grounded spatial reasoning tasks. The cooperative dynamics between the Reasoner and Retriever agents represent a notable enhancement over previous methods that relied on full graph representations, addressing issues related to hallucination—a common problem in LLM applications. **Strengths:** - **Novelty of Approach**: The unique use of a schema-based guidance effectively governs the interactions between reasoning and retrieval components, which is relatively unexplored in current literature. - **Performance Improvements**: The experimental results demonstrating superior performance in numerical Q&A and planning tasks are noteworthy, showcasing the practical viability of the proposed framework. - **Iterative Collaboration**: The cooperative dynamics encourage a more refined approach to information extraction, enhancing the model's ability to adaptively focus on relevant graph portions. **Weaknesses:** - **Limited Context on Implementation**: The paper may not sufficiently detail the technical implementation specifics or potential computational challenges involved in real-world application of the SG-RwR framework. - **Generality and Scalability**: While the results are promising, the experimental scenarios may not fully encompass diverse real-world applications, which limits the generality of the conclusions. - **Dependence on Schema**: The requirement to operate solely on scene graph schemas may hinder the framework's adaptability in scenarios where comprehensive graph data might be beneficial. **Potential Influence**: The framework could pave the way for further exploration of schema-based methodologies in the integration of reasoning and data retrieval within artificial intelligence. The performance enhancements presented may inspire subsequent research and application development in related areas. **Score**: 8 **Justification**: The score reflects a strong contribution to the field of LLMs and scene graph reasoning through its innovative framework that mitigates common challenges while providing verifiable improvements in performance. The unique combination of agents and schema-guided interaction demonstrates significant advancement, though the paper's impact could be tempered by the issues surrounding implementation details and application scope.

### Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03460v1)
- **Authors**: Boyao Wang, Rui Pan, Shizhe Diao, Xingyuan Pan, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Tong Zhang
- **Abstract**: Small language models (SLMs) have attracted considerable attention from both academia and industry due to their broad range of applications in edge devices. To obtain SLMs with strong performance, conventional approaches either pre-train the models from scratch, which incurs substantial computational costs, or compress/prune existing large language models (LLMs), which results in performance drops and falls short in comparison to pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the family of acceleration methods that involve both structured pruning and model training. We found 1) layer-wise adaptive pruning (Adapt-Pruner) is extremely effective in LLMs and yields significant improvements over existing pruning techniques, 2) adaptive pruning equipped with further training leads to models comparable to those pre-training from scratch, 3) incremental pruning brings non-trivial performance gain by interleaving pruning with training and only removing a small portion of neurons ($\sim$5%) at a time. Experimental results on LLaMA-3.1-8B demonstrate that Adapt-Pruner outperforms conventional pruning methods, such as LLM-Pruner, FLAP, and SliceGPT, by an average of 1%-7% in accuracy on commonsense benchmarks. Additionally, Adapt-Pruner restores the performance of MobileLLM-125M to 600M on the MMLU benchmark with 200$\times$ fewer tokens via pruning from its larger counterparts, and discovers a new 1B model that surpasses LLaMA-3.2-1B in multiple benchmarks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled **"Adapt-Pruner: Adaptive Structural Pruning for Efficient Small Language Model Training"** addresses the challenge of developing small language models (SLMs) that perform competitively with larger models without incurring the high costs of pre-training from scratch. The authors reveal that traditional pruning methods lead to performance degradation and are less effective than pre-training. They introduce a novel method, Adapt-Pruner, which employs layer-wise adaptive pruning and integrates it with further model training, thereby achieving results comparable to models trained from scratch. The paper highlights key findings:  1. Adapt-Pruner significantly enhances performance over conventional pruning techniques. 2. Adaptive pruning along with extended training remedies performance issues seen in pre-trained models. 3. Incremental pruning allows the removal of only a small portion of neurons, leading to gains in performance while maintaining model integrity. The experiments demonstrated that Adapt-Pruner outperforms existing methods such as LLM-Pruner and FLAP in commonsense benchmarks, and notably enhances the performance of MobileLLM-125M. Furthermore, the authors report the discovery of a new 1B model outperforming LLaMA-3.2-1B on several benchmarks. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation  **Novelty**: The paper presents a systematic approach to enhance the structural pruning of language models adaptively during training, which is a relatively underexplored area. The layering aspect and the integration of training into the pruning process stand out as a novel contribution. However, the idea of using adaptive pruning may not be wholly new; similar concepts have been explored in various forms within the literature. **Significance**: The findings are pertinent to the ongoing pursuit of efficient model training methods, especially for deployment in resource-constrained environments. The notion that adaptive pruning can yield comparable results to full pre-training could significantly impact how researchers and practitioners approach the development of SLMs. **Strengths**: 1. The experimental validation using LLaMA-3.1-8B and MobileLLM provides robust support for the claims made, demonstrating clear and measurable performance improvements. 2. The potential for real-world applications in edge devices enhances the paper’s relevance and impact. **Weaknesses**: 1. The paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the limitations of the proposed method versus current state-of-the-art techniques. 2. A deeper analysis of the implications of pruning and re-training cycles would bolster the scientific rigor of the findings. **Potential Influence**: Given the increasing reliance on efficient language models in AI applications, this work could influence future research and practical implementations significantly, although the impact may largely depend on how widely the community adopts these techniques. **Overall Assessment**: The paper effectively contributes to the conversation around SLMs by presenting a promising technique that could bridge the gap between resource-intensive pre-training and subpar pruning methods. While it has notable strengths in its experimental approach and relevance, its novelty is somewhat constrained by existing literature. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, acknowledging both the innovative methodological approach and the need for further exploration of its broader implications and limitations.

### Do Large Language Model Benchmarks Test Reliability?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03461v1)
- **Authors**: Joshua Vendrow, Edward Vendrow, Sara Beery, Aleksander Madry
- **Abstract**: When deploying large language models (LLMs), it is important to ensure that these models are not only capable, but also reliable. Many benchmarks have been created to track LLMs' growing capabilities, however there has been no similar focus on measuring their reliability. To understand the potential ramifications of this gap, we investigate how well current benchmarks quantify model reliability. We find that pervasive label errors can compromise these evaluations, obscuring lingering model failures and hiding unreliable behavior. Motivated by this gap in the evaluation of reliability, we then propose the concept of so-called platinum benchmarks, i.e., benchmarks carefully curated to minimize label errors and ambiguity. As a first attempt at constructing such benchmarks, we revise examples from fifteen existing popular benchmarks. We evaluate a wide range of models on these platinum benchmarks and find that, indeed, frontier LLMs still exhibit failures on simple tasks such as elementary-level math word problems. Analyzing these failures further reveals previously unidentified patterns of problems on which frontier models consistently struggle. We provide code at https://github.com/MadryLab/platinum-benchmarks
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses a critical but underexplored dimension of large language models (LLMs) – their reliability. While existing benchmarks primarily assess the capabilities of LLMs, there is a lack of focus on evaluating reliability, which can lead to misinterpretations of model performance. The authors identify that many current benchmarks suffer from label errors that obscure the true reliability of LLMs. To tackle this issue, the paper introduces the concept of "platinum benchmarks," which are carefully designed to minimize label errors and ambiguity. The authors revise examples from fifteen popular benchmarks to create these platinum standards, evaluating various models against them. The results indicate that even state-of-the-art LLMs continue to exhibit failures in relatively simple domains, such as basic mathematical reasoning. The analysis further reveals consistent patterns in which models struggle, thus providing a deeper understanding of their limitations. The paper contributes to the field by providing a repository of code for the newly developed platinum benchmarks to facilitate future research. **Critical Evaluation:** The inherent novelty of the paper lies in its focus on benchmarking reliability, an aspect that has been largely overlooked in the evaluation of LLMs. By formalizing the concept of platinum benchmarks, the authors propose a tangible solution to a significant issue, thereby fostering the improvement of evaluation practices in AI research. Furthermore, the revision of existing benchmarks and the empirical evaluation of model performance against updated standards reinforces the paper's contributions to the field. Strengths: 1. **Identifies a Critical Gap**: The recognition that current benchmarks do not adequately test reliability fills an important research gap, encouraging a shift in focus for further studies. 2. **Practical Solution**: The introduction of platinum benchmarks offers a practical approach to enhancing the evaluation of model reliability that can be widely adopted. 3. **Empirical Evidence**: The analysis of frontier models against new benchmarks provides concrete data that reveals consistent areas of failure. Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the study focuses on fifteen benchmarks, the broader applicability of the platinum benchmarks to other models and domains remains to be seen. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: Although patterns of failures are identified, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the underlying causes for these consistent issues across models. Overall, the paper offers a significant contribution by bridging a gap in the evaluation of LLMs, presenting both theoretical and practical implications for future research. It also lays a foundation for improvement in model assessments, influencing both academic and industrial practices in AI development.  Score: 8

### An Empirical Exploration of ChatGPT's Ability to Support Problem Formulation Tasks for Mission Engineering and a Documentation of its Performance Variability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03511v1)
- **Authors**: Max Ofsa, Taylan G. Topcu
- **Abstract**: Systems engineering (SE) is evolving with the availability of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and the demand for a systems-of-systems perspective, formalized under the purview of mission engineering (ME) in the US Department of Defense. Formulating ME problems is challenging because they are open-ended exercises that involve translation of ill-defined problems into well-defined ones that are amenable for engineering development. It remains to be seen to which extent AI could assist problem formulation objectives. To that end, this paper explores the quality and consistency of multi-purpose Large Language Models (LLM) in supporting ME problem formulation tasks, specifically focusing on stakeholder identification. We identify a relevant reference problem, a NASA space mission design challenge, and document ChatGPT-3.5's ability to perform stakeholder identification tasks. We execute multiple parallel attempts and qualitatively evaluate LLM outputs, focusing on both their quality and variability. Our findings portray a nuanced picture. We find that the LLM performs well in identifying human-focused stakeholders but poorly in recognizing external systems and environmental factors, despite explicit efforts to account for these. Additionally, LLMs struggle with preserving the desired level of abstraction and exhibit a tendency to produce solution specific outputs that are inappropriate for problem formulation. More importantly, we document great variability among parallel threads, highlighting that LLM outputs should be used with caution, ideally by adopting a stochastic view of their abilities. Overall, our findings suggest that, while ChatGPT could reduce some expert workload, its lack of consistency and domain understanding may limit its reliability for problem formulation tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT-3.5 as a support tool for problem formulation in mission engineering (ME), specifically through the lens of stakeholder identification in a NASA space mission design challenge. The study aims to assess the performance quality and variability of multi-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in translating ill-defined ME problems into more structured forms. The authors conducted multiple trials and qualitatively evaluated the outputs, revealing that while ChatGPT excels in identifying human stakeholders, it struggles to accurately recognize external systems and environmental factors. Moreover, the LLM demonstrated a tendency to generate solutions-specific outputs, compromising its effectiveness in problem formulation. Significant variability in the outputs across trials was noted, suggesting a need for caution when utilizing LLMs in this context. Ultimately, the findings suggest that while generative AI can assist in reducing expert workload, inconsistencies and limited domain knowledge restrict its reliability in formal problem formulation tasks. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:**  The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic: the intersection of generative AI and systems engineering, particularly within the framework of mission engineering, a pressing area in defense applications. By focusing on the less-studied aspect of problem formulation support via LLMs, the authors open pathways for future research in applying AI in engineering disciplines. However, there is existing literature on LLM utilization in other subtasks within systems engineering, so the contribution may not be as groundbreaking as it initially appears. **Significance:** The exploration of performance variability in ChatGPT is significant, particularly in a field requiring high reliability such as defense and mission engineering. Demonstrating both the utility and limitations of LLMs in this context is critical for guiding future applications of AI technology. However, the findings indicate that reliance solely on LLMs might be imprudent due to the issues of consistency and depth of understanding, which poses a challenge to the field's ongoing digital transformation. **Strengths:** 1. **Timeliness and Relevance:** The topic of AI in engineering is highly pertinent given current trends in digital transformation. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of a qualitative evaluation to assess AI output over multiple trials lends credibility to the results. 3. **Pragmatic Implications:** The findings underscore practical considerations for engineering practices when integrating LLMs. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The focus is on one specific LLM (ChatGPT-3.5) and a single application area (stakeholder identification). Broader comparisons with other LLMs or methods may provide more comprehensive insights. 2. **Variability Documentation**: While the variances encountered are crucial, the paper does not extensively analyze the causes behind this variability, which could have added depth to the findings. 3. **Generalizability**: The findings may not be fully applicable to other domains of systems engineering or broader AI applications without further investigation. ### Overall Score: Given the paper's relevant subject matter and the exploration of an important application of LLMs, it presents a significant contribution to the discourse on AI in engineering fields. However, its limitations in scope and broader implications result in a moderately high score. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper’s valuable insights into the intersection of AI and engineering, while recognizing the need for further exploration to substantiate and expand upon its findings.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03512v1)
- **Authors**: Amitava Das, Yaswanth Narsupalli, Gurpreet Singh, Vinija Jain, Vasu Sharma, Suranjana Trivedy, Aman Chadha, Amit Sheth
- **Abstract**: Precise alignment in Text-to-Image (T2I) systems is crucial to ensure that generated visuals not only accurately encapsulate user intents but also conform to stringent ethical and aesthetic benchmarks. Incidents like the Google Gemini fiasco, where misaligned outputs triggered significant public backlash, underscore the critical need for robust alignment mechanisms. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in alignment. Building on these advancements, researchers are eager to apply similar alignment techniques, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), to T2I systems to enhance image generation fidelity and reliability. We present YinYangAlign, an advanced benchmarking framework that systematically quantifies the alignment fidelity of T2I systems, addressing six fundamental and inherently contradictory design objectives. Each pair represents fundamental tensions in image generation, such as balancing adherence to user prompts with creative modifications or maintaining diversity alongside visual coherence. YinYangAlign includes detailed axiom datasets featuring human prompts, aligned (chosen) responses, misaligned (rejected) AI-generated outputs, and explanations of the underlying contradictions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "YINYANG-ALIGN" addresses the critical need for precise alignment in Text-to-Image (T2I) systems, aiming to improve generated image quality by ensuring these systems fully capture user intentions while adhering to ethical and aesthetic standards. It highlights past failures, like the Google Gemini incident, to underscore the necessity for better alignment mechanisms. The authors introduce YinYangAlign, a benchmarking framework that quantifies the alignment fidelity of T2I systems by addressing six contradictory design objectives, reflecting tensions like user adherence versus creativity and diversity versus coherence. The framework includes comprehensive datasets with human prompts and various AI-generated responses, facilitating a deeper understanding of alignment contradictions. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of T2I systems through its introduction of the YinYangAlign framework. The focus on benchmarking alignment and addressing the inherent contradictions in user intent and AI interpretation is both timely and relevant given recent failures in T2I technology. The novelty lies in the structured approach to quantifying alignment fidelity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which is relatively under-explored in the context of T2I compared to its application in other domains like LLMs. However, the paper has certain weaknesses that must be addressed. Firstly, while the introduction of the benchmarking framework is valuable, the paper could benefit from more robust empirical results demonstrating how effectively YinYangAlign performs compared to existing methods. Without rigorous validation, it is difficult to ascertain the framework's practical impact on improving T2I systems. Additionally, while the identification of six contradictory objectives is insightful, the complexity of these objectives could lead to challenges in achieving balanced optimization, which the paper does not sufficiently tackle. Despite these shortcomings, the proposed framework has the potential to influence how researchers approach alignment in T2I systems. By systemically quantifying alignment fidelity, it establishes a new standard for evaluating and improving these models. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to T2I alignment research and its innovative framework. It recognizes the potential to advance the field while also considering the need for more rigorous validation and deeper exploration of implementation challenges.

- **Authors**: Fred Zhangzhi Peng, Zachary Bezemek, Sawan Patel, Sherwood Yao, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Alexander Tong, Pranam Chatterjee
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we investigate how the order in which tokens are unmasked during masked diffusion models (MDMs) inference affects generative quality. We derive an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) that introduces a planner, responsible for selecting which tokens to unmask at each step. Our analysis suggests that alternative unmasking strategies can improve generative performance. Based on these insights, we propose Path Planning (P2), a sampling framework that leverages pre-trained BERT or the denoiser itself to guide unmasking decisions. P2 generalizes all known MDM sampling strategies and enables significant improvements across diverse domains including language generation (in-context learning, code generation, story infilling, mathematical reasoning, reverse curse correction) and biological sequence generation (protein and RNA sequences).
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Path Planning for Masked Diffusion Model Sampling" explores the impact of the sequence in which tokens are unmasked on the generative quality of masked diffusion models (MDMs). It introduces an expanded evidence lower bound (ELBO) which incorporates a planner to determine the optimal unmasking order for tokens during the inference process. The authors propose a new sampling framework called Path Planning (P2), which utilizes pre-trained BERT or the denoiser to inform these unmasking choices. This framework not only generalizes existing MDM sampling methods but also demonstrates performance enhancements across various domains, including language generation tasks (like story infilling and code generation) and biological sequence generation (such as protein and RNA sequences). **Evaluation:** The paper presents a notable advancement in the understanding and application of masked diffusion models, particularly through its introduction of a planning component for token unmasking. The novelty lies in the proposition that the unmasking strategy critically influences the generative performance, an important insight that could benefit various fields utilizing generative models. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: The introduction of Path Planning (P2) could reshape how MDMs are implemented, as it proposes a dynamic approach to unmasking. 2. **Wide Applicability**: Demonstrating improvements across diverse tasks indicates that the methodology is broadly relevant and could encourage further research in multiple domains. 3. **Theoretical Grounding**: With derivations based on ELBO, the paper provides a solid theoretical foundation which enhances its credibility. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Empirical Validation**: While the paper claims significant improvements, the nature and extent of these enhancements could be scrutinized. A more thorough comparison to existing methods using standardized benchmarks would strengthen the claims. 2. **Complexity**: The introduction of a planning mechanism adds complexity which may deter implementation or could complicate training processes, potentially limiting use by practitioners. 3. **Lack of Robustness Analysis**: Insights into the robustness of the proposed method across various contexts (different datasets, noise variations, etc.) are not thoroughly explored, which may raise concerns about generalizability. **Overall Impact:** Given its theoretical contributions, potential practical applications, and the authors' promising findings, the paper provides valuable insights into the realm of generative modeling. However, the true impact of the proposed methods may depend on further empirical validation and simplification for practical use. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, particularly in terms of novelty and applicability, while recognizing the need for additional empirical analysis and clarity on practical implementation.

### Kronecker Mask and Interpretive Prompts are Language-Action Video Learners
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03549v1)
- **Authors**: Jingyi Yang, Zitong Yu, Xiuming Ni, Jia He, Hui Li
- **Abstract**: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) has significantly advanced image-based vision learning. A pressing topic subsequently arises: how can we effectively adapt CLIP to the video domain? Recent studies have focused on adjusting either the textual or visual branch of CLIP for action recognition. However, we argue that adaptations of both branches are crucial. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CLAVER}: a \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}anguage-\textbf{A}ction \textbf{V}ideo Learn\textbf{er}, designed to shift CLIP's focus from the alignment of static visual objects and concrete nouns to the alignment of dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Kronecker mask attention for temporal modeling. Our tailored Kronecker mask offers three benefits 1) it expands the temporal receptive field for each token, 2) it serves as an effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity inductive bias, mitigating the issue of spatiotemporal homogenization, and 3) it can be seamlessly plugged into transformer-based models. Regarding the textual branch, we leverage large language models to generate diverse, sentence-level and semantically rich interpretive prompts of actions, which shift the model's focus towards the verb comprehension. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and learning scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generality of our approach. The code will be available soon.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CLAVER (Contrastive Language-Action Video Learner), a model that enhances the CLIP architecture for video action recognition by adapting both its textual and visual branches. The authors highlight the need to focus on dynamic action behaviors and abstract verbs instead of merely aligning static objects with concrete nouns. They present a novel Kronecker mask attention mechanism designed for better temporal modeling in videos, which expands the temporal receptive field, introduces effective spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and integrates smoothly into transformer models. Additionally, they utilize large language models to create rich interpretive prompts that drive the focus towards verb comprehension in the textual branch. This approach shows promise through various benchmarks, demonstrating both superiority and generalizability. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of action recognition in video by effectively addressing a significant gap in existing CLIP adaptations. The introduction of the Kronecker mask attention mechanism is innovative in enhancing temporal modeling which is often a challenge in video analysis. The dual adaptation strategy—emphasizing the textual analysis of actions and the visual representation—suggests a holistic approach that may offer improvements in action recognition tasks. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The combination of adapting both branches of CLIP and introducing a Kronecker mask is a clear advancement that intends to mitigate the limitations of previous models focused on static elements. 2. **Comprehensive Methodology:** The use of large language models to generate interpretive prompts is a thoughtful integration that extends the understanding of actions in context, potentially enriching the learning experience for the model. 3. **Experimental Validation:** The reported results across various benchmarks substantiate the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method, suggesting robustness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While the Kronecker mask is innovative, its complexity could pose challenges in terms of scalability and computational efficiency, particularly in real-time applications. 2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion on any potential drawbacks or trade-offs involved in integrating these new techniques. 3. **Generalizability Concerns:** While extensive experiments are mentioned, further investigation into the method’s adaptability across diverse action recognition cases and its performance in unstructured environments would strengthen the findings. Overall, while CLAVER showcases significant innovative strides in adapting the CLIP architecture for video analysis, its real-world applicability and scalability remain somewhat unaddressed. The combination of technical innovation and practical application posits this work as a meaningful contribution to the field of video action recognition, warranting a high score.  **Score: 8**

### Code Simulation as a Proxy for High-order Tasks in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03568v1)
- **Authors**: Emanuele La Malfa, Christoph Weinhuber, Orazio Torre, Fangru Lin, X. Angelo Huang, Samuele Marro, Anthony Cohn, Nigel Shadbolt, Michael Wooldridge
- **Abstract**: Many reasoning, planning, and problem-solving tasks share an intrinsic algorithmic nature: correctly simulating each step is a sufficient condition to solve them correctly. We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper investigates the use of code simulation as a tool to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex tasks. It posits that many reasoning and problem-solving tasks can be framed as algorithmic processes where simulating each step is essential for accurate solutions. The authors compare naturalistic reasoning tasks, which are labor-intensive and require meticulous human design, with synthetic tasks that can be generated at scale and capture similar challenges. They draw analogies between constructs in programming (like straight-line programs and nested loops) and the components of these reasoning tasks. The research demonstrates that while advanced LLMs can execute simulated tasks competently, their performance tends to be fragile and susceptible to issues like memorization and a reliance on superficial pattern recognition. The paper thus emphasizes the potential of synthetic data as a scalable alternative on par with traditionally crafted problems. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper addresses a critical gap in the evaluation of LLMs, proposing synthetic task generation as an alternative to the labor-intensive creation of naturalistic tasks. This could democratize access to robust evaluation protocols for LLM capabilities. 2. **Scalability of Data:** By demonstrating that synthetic data can serve as a sufficient proxy for more complex reasoning tasks, the authors provide a framework that may facilitate more extensive testing and application of LLMs across different domains without the barrier of needing expert-crafted problems. 3. **Focus on Execution Fragility:** The detailed analysis of LLM performance, especially regarding its reliance on memorization and pattern recognition, is a notable insight that can inform further research into improving model robustness and reliability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the focus on sorting problems and nested loops is insightful, it may not encompass the full range of reasoning and problem-solving tasks that LLMs might encounter in practical applications, potentially limiting the generalizability of their findings. 2. **Complexity of Real-world Tasks:** The assumption that synthetic tasks can fully replicate the nuanced challenges posed by naturalistic tasks could be questioned. Real-world problems often involve ambiguity and nuanced understanding that synthetic tasks may fail to capture fully. 3. **Potential Overemphasis on Fragility:** Although performance fragility is an important consideration, the implications of this finding need further exploration. The paper could benefit from a deeper analysis of how these observed failures may translate into practical limitations for LLM applications. ### Conclusion While the paper contributes significantly to the discussion of evaluating LLM capabilities through synthetic tasks, it also leaves room for further inquiry into the scope of such tasks and the nature of LLM performance under varied conditions. Its dual approach, combining theoretical constructs with empirical assessments of model capabilities, suggests a meaningful advancement in the field. However, the narrow focus on specific types of tasks and the need for broader applicability reduce its overall impact. **Score: 7**

### Bilevel ZOFO: Bridging Parameter-Efficient and Zeroth-Order Techniques for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning and Meta-Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03604v1)
- **Authors**: Reza Shirkavand, Qi He, Peiran Yu, Heng Huang
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks using First-Order (FO) optimizers presents significant computational challenges. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) methods have been proposed to address these challenges by freezing most model parameters and training only a small subset. While PEFT is efficient, it may not outperform full fine-tuning when high task-specific performance is required. Zeroth-Order (ZO) methods offer an alternative for fine-tuning the entire pre-trained model by approximating gradients using only the forward pass, thus eliminating the computational burden of back-propagation in first-order methods. However, when implementing ZO methods, a hard prompt is crucial, and relying on simple, fixed hard prompts may not be optimal. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization framework that complements ZO methods with PEFT to mitigate sensitivity to hard prompts while efficiently and effectively fine-tuning LLMs. Our Bilevel ZOFO (Zeroth-Order-First-Order) method employs a double-loop optimization strategy, where only the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model are required. We provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO. Empirically, we demonstrate that Bilevel ZOFO outperforms both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task settings while maintaining similar memory efficiency. Additionally, we show its strong potential for multitask learning. Compared to current first-order meta-training algorithms for multitask learning, our method has significantly lower computational demands while maintaining or improving performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Bilevel ZOFO: Bridging Parameter-Efficient and Zeroth-Order Techniques for Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning and Meta-Training" addresses the significant computational challenges associated with fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using first-order (FO) optimizers. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows for training a limited number of model parameters, it may not achieve the necessary high performance for specific tasks compared to full fine-tuning. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods eliminate the back-propagation step by approximating gradients through forward passes, but they require effective hard prompts, which may not always be optimally designed. To reconcile these limitations, the authors propose "Bilevel ZOFO," a bilevel optimization framework that integrates ZO methods with PEFT. This method employs a double-loop optimization strategy that relies solely on the gradient of the PEFT model and the forward pass of the base model, thus simplifying the computational process. The authors provide convergence guarantees for Bilevel ZOFO and empirically demonstrate its superiority over both PEFT and ZO methods in single-task scenarios, while also exhibiting strong potential for multitask learning with lower computational demands. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The proposal of combining PEFT with ZO techniques in a bilevel framework is a novel approach that aims to address the computational inefficiencies in fine-tuning LLMs. By introducing a framework that requires fewer resources while enhancing performance in specific tasks, the paper contributes a meaningful perspective to the field of LLM optimization, which is critical given the increasing deployment of such models. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to make LLM training more accessible and efficient, which can be particularly impactful in real-world applications that require rapid iteration and deployment. The demonstrated improvements in performance combined with memory efficiency could advance best practices in LLM fine-tuning and multitask learning. **Strengths:** - Clear identification of the problem and limitations of current PEFT and ZO options. - Proposed method shows empirical advantages over existing methods with robust experimental results. - The inclusion of convergence guarantees adds to the theoretical underpinning of the work. **Weaknesses:** - The reliance on the effectiveness of the hard prompts, even with a new framework, may still introduce variability in performance that needs further exploration. - While the multitask capabilities are noted, more extensive empirical studies across a broader range of tasks would strengthen the claims. - The paper may not fully address the potential trade-offs between computational savings and model capacity in more complex situations involving dynamic prompts. In conclusion, Bilevel ZOFO presents a promising advancement in the efficient fine-tuning of LLMs, with empirical evidence supporting its efficacy. However, the reliance on hard prompts and the need for further validation in diverse task scenarios highlight areas for further research. **Score:** 8 This score reflects the paper's significant contribution to the field, combining innovative ideas with demonstrable results, while recognizing the need for further exploration under varying conditions. The mixture of theoretical and empirical work adds to its robustness, making it a noteworthy publication in the domain of LLM optimization and training efficiency.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in diffusion models hold significant potential in robotics, enabling the generation of diverse and smooth trajectories directly from raw representations of the environment. Despite this promise, applying diffusion models to motion planning remains challenging due to their difficulty in enforcing critical constraints, such as collision avoidance and kinematic feasibility. These limitations become even more pronounced in Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP), where multiple robots must coordinate in shared spaces. To address this challenge, this work proposes Simultaneous MRMP Diffusion (SMD), a novel approach integrating constrained optimization into the diffusion sampling process to produce collision-free, kinematically feasible trajectories. Additionally, the paper introduces a comprehensive MRMP benchmark to evaluate trajectory planning algorithms across scenarios with varying robot densities, obstacle complexities, and motion constraints. Experimental results show SMD consistently outperforms classical and learning-based motion planners, achieving higher success rates and efficiency in complex multi-robot environments.

### SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03638v1)
- **Authors**: Daniel Levy, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Qiang Zhu, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
- **Abstract**: Generating novel crystalline materials has potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper proposes a novel diffusion-based generative model called SymmCD, designed to generate novel crystalline materials while preserving their inherent symmetry—a crucial characteristic that influences materials' physical properties. Unlike previous methods that either fail to maintain symmetry or simply replicate examples from a database, SymmCD explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into its generative framework. The authors break down crystals into an asymmetric unit and the symmetry transformations necessary to produce the entire crystal. By learning the joint distribution of these components through diffusion, and utilizing an interpretable representation for transformations, SymmCD demonstrates the capability to generate diverse and valid crystal structures with realistic symmetrical properties. The model shows competitive performance on a dataset from the Materials Project, indicating its effectiveness in generating novel materials with potential applications in various fields. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies primarily in the integration of diffusion models with crystallographic symmetry, which has been less explored in material generation tasks. By focusing on the decomposition of crystals and the elaboration of their symmetry properties, the authors address significant limitations in existing approaches. The explicit incorporation of symmetry into the generative process is a noteworthy advancement that enhances the fidelity of generated crystals to real-world counterparts. Strengths of the paper include: - A clear and innovative approach to addressing symmetry in crystal generation. - Evidence of competitive performance against existing methods, demonstrated through the application to the Materials Project dataset. - An interpretable representation for symmetry transformations, which adds a layer of usability and generalization. However, a few weaknesses need to be addressed: - The paper could benefit from a more in-depth comparison with other symmetry-preserving approaches, if available, to strengthen its claims of superiority. - While the model's performance is highlighted, additional quantitative data and benchmarks would enhance the robustness of the findings and bolster claims of novelty and capability. In terms of influence on the field, if successfully validated in further studies, SymmCD could significantly impact the development of new materials with tailored properties, benefiting sectors like electronics and energy storage. Given these considerations, I assign the paper a score of 8. This score reflects a strong level of novelty and potential impact, tempered by the need for additional comparisons and quantitative analysis to further substantiate its claims and to fully realize its potential in the research community. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yunuo Chen, Junli Cao, Anil Kag, Vidit Goel, Sergei Korolev, Chenfanfu Jiang, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren
- **Abstract**: We present a novel video generation framework that integrates 3-dimensional geometry and dynamic awareness. To achieve this, we augment 2D videos with 3D point trajectories and align them in pixel space. The resulting 3D-aware video dataset, PointVid, is then used to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, enabling it to track 2D objects with 3D Cartesian coordinates. Building on this, we regularize the shape and motion of objects in the video to eliminate undesired artifacts, \eg, nonphysical deformation. Consequently, we enhance the quality of generated RGB videos and alleviate common issues like object morphing, which are prevalent in current video models due to a lack of shape awareness. With our 3D augmentation and regularization, our model is capable of handling contact-rich scenarios such as task-oriented videos. These videos involve complex interactions of solids, where 3D information is essential for perceiving deformation and contact. Furthermore, our model improves the overall quality of video generation by promoting the 3D consistency of moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a video generation framework that enhances the understanding of physical interactions in videos by incorporating 3D geometry and dynamic awareness. It achieves this through the development of a new video dataset called PointVid, which augments conventional 2D videos with 3D point trajectories aligned in pixel space. This dataset is utilized to fine-tune a latent diffusion model, allowing it to effectively track objects in 2D space while incorporating their 3D Cartesian coordinates. The authors implement a regularization approach that addresses artifacts such as nonphysical object deformations and enhances video quality—specifically targeting issues like object morphing, which is common in existing generative models. The proposed model demonstrates improved performance in handling scenarios that require rich interactions and 3D awareness, such as task-oriented videos, by promoting 3D consistency among moving objects and reducing abrupt changes in shape and motion. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The core contribution of incorporating 3D point trajectories into a video generation framework is innovative. While prior research has explored video generation techniques, the coupling of 3D geometry with a latent diffusion model and the introduction of a tailored dataset (PointVid) represent significant strides in tackling the limitations of 2D-only approaches. The approach to regularization that mitigates issues like object morphing through a physics-informed lens is also a noteworthy advancement. **Significance:** The implications of this work are substantial, particularly for applications that necessitate realistic simulations of physical interactions, such as robotics and computer graphics. By improving the physical accuracy of generated videos, this work could influence future research directions in both video synthesis and the integration of 3D understanding in generative models. **Strengths:** 1. The integration of 3D data with existing models may open new avenues for realistic video generation. 2. The methodology addresses significant challenges such as nonphysical deformations, enhancing user trust in generated media. 3. The creation of the PointVid dataset may serve as a valuable resource for future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. The paper lacks a detailed comparison with other state-of-the-art video generation models, which could substantiate claims of superiority in performance and artifact reduction. 2. The evaluation metrics employed to assess video quality may need clearer justification regarding their relevance to objective human evaluation. 3. The practical implementation details (e.g., computational cost) of the proposed approach aren't thoroughly discussed, which may deter wider adoption. Considering these factors, I assign a score of **8**. While the work shows strong innovation and potential significance in the field of video generation and 3D modeling, it would benefit from deeper comparative evaluation and a more detailed discussion of implementation challenges.

- **Authors**: Nirola Kobanov, Edmund Weatherstone, Zachary Vanderpoel, Orlando Wetherby
- **Abstract**: Maintaining semantic consistency over extended text sequences remains a fundamental challenge in long-form text generation, where conventional training methodologies often struggle to prevent contextual drift and coherence degradation. A novel gradient modulation approach is introduced, designed to adjust parameter updates dynamically in response to contextual relevance, ensuring that generated text remains aligned with prior discourse. By integrating a modulation function that selectively amplifies or attenuates gradients based on learned contextual dependencies, the proposed method enhances the stability of model-generated narratives without imposing significant computational overhead. Comparative evaluations against baseline models reveal improvements in coherence, contextual retention, and long-range dependency tracking, demonstrating the effectiveness of modifying the learning process at the gradient level. The results indicate that sentence structure variability and lexical diversity benefit from this approach, mitigating repetitive phrasing and improving adaptability across diverse linguistic contexts. Statistical validation of coherence metrics further substantiates the observed enhancements, with a significant reduction in inconsistencies emerging as a direct consequence of the modulation mechanism. Computational efficiency assessments confirm that the framework achieves these gains without requiring substantial modifications to the underlying architecture, ensuring compatibility with existing optimization workflows.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel approach called Context-Preserving Gradient Modulation to address the challenge of maintaining semantic consistency during long-form text generation. Traditional methods often face issues with contextual drift and degradation of coherence. The proposed method dynamically adjusts parameter updates based on contextual relevance through a modulation function, enhancing the model's ability to generate coherent narratives while keeping computational costs low. Evaluations against baseline models indicate improvements in coherence, contextual retention, long-range dependency tracking, and textual diversity, leading to less repetitive phrasing.

- **Authors**: Zeyu Tang, Zhenhao Chen, Loka Li, Xiangchen Song, Yunlong Deng, Yifan Shen, Guangyi Chen, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang
- **Abstract**: The autoregressive decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), while widely used, is inherently suboptimal due to the lack of a built-in mechanism to perform refinement and/or correction of the generated content. In this paper, we consider optimality in terms of the joint probability over the generated response, when jointly considering all tokens at the same time. We theoretically characterize the potential deviation of the autoregressively generated response from its globally optimal counterpart that is of the same length. Our analysis suggests that we need to be cautious when noticeable uncertainty arises during text generation, which may signal the sub-optimality of the generation history. To address the pitfall of autoregressive decoding for text generation, we propose an approach that incorporates a sliding reflection window and a pausing criterion, such that refinement and generation can be carried out interchangeably as the decoding proceeds. Our selective refinement framework strikes a balance between efficiency and optimality, and our extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** This paper introduces a novel method called Reflection-Window Decoding for text generation in large language models (LLMs), addressing the inefficiencies of traditional autoregressive decoding, which cannot effectively refine generated content. The authors argue that the joint probability of the generated text should be optimized, taking into account all tokens simultaneously. They provide theoretical insights into how autoregressive methods can produce sub-optimal outputs, especially under uncertainty. To overcome this issue, the paper proposes a selective refinement framework that utilizes a sliding reflection window alongside a pausing criterion, allowing for an interchangeable process of text generation and refinement. Experimental results illustrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in enhancing the quality of generated text while maintaining efficiency. --- **Critical Evaluation:** *Novelty:* The paper presents an innovative approach by combining the concepts of reflection and selective refinement within text generation, which seems to be less explored in the current literature on LLMs. The introduction of a sliding reflection window as a mechanism for addressing the limitations of autoregressive models represents a noteworthy advancement. However, it builds on existing methodologies without completely overturning current understanding, which slightly tempers its originality. *Significance:* The implications of this research are considerable for improving text generation models, particularly in applications that require higher accuracy and coherence. The strong theoretical foundation adds rigor, making the proposed framework not just empirically valid but also robust in terms of underlying logic. Nonetheless, while the approach shows promise, its practical applicability in real-world contexts, where computational resources and time are constraints, needs further exploration. *Strengths:* - The integration of refinement into the decoding process is a critical advancement in improving text generation. - The theoretical analysis adds credibility and depth, providing a clear rationale for changes proposed. - Experimental results support the claims made, indicating that the method enhances quality without a significant compromise on efficiency. *Weaknesses:* - The approach may still face scalability issues; how it performs within high-stakes, large-scale deployments remains unassessed. - The practical implications in various text generation scenarios (e.g., dialogue systems, automated content creation) require clearer alignment with real-world constraints. - Further examination of trade-offs between optimality and efficiency in diverse contexts is warranted. Overall, while the paper contributes meaningful insights and develops a new framework that can refine text generation processes in LLMs, the balance between novelty and applicability raises questions. The need for additional empirical validation in diverse contexts limits the asserted impact. **Rationale for Score:** Given the novel approach to enhancing autoregressive decoding and the strong theoretical and empirical basis presented, yet considering the limitations and need for further validation, this paper should be rated as moderately impactful in its field. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Kushagra Pandey, Farrin Marouf Sofian, Felix Draxler, Theofanis Karaletsos, Stephan Mandt
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models exhibit excellent sample quality, but existing guidance methods often require additional model training or are limited to specific tasks. We revisit guidance in diffusion models from the perspective of variational inference and control, introducing Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) that enables guiding pretrained diffusion trajectories to satisfy a terminal cost. DTM unifies a broad class of guidance methods and enables novel instantiations. We introduce a new method within this framework that achieves state-of-the-art results on several linear and (blind) non-linear inverse problems without requiring additional model training or modifications. For instance, in ImageNet non-linear deblurring, our model achieves an FID score of 34.31, significantly improving over the best pretrained-method baseline (FID 78.07). We will make the code available in a future update.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Variational Control for Guidance in Diffusion Models" presents a novel method called Diffusion Trajectory Matching (DTM) for guiding pretrained diffusion models without the need for additional training or specific adaptations.

DTM is shown to unify a wide range of existing guidance methods and allows for new implementations. The authors showcase the effectiveness of their proposed method through several experiments, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on various linear and non-linear inverse problems. Notably, it significantly improves ImageNet non-linear deblurring, achieving an FID score of 34.31, which is markedly better than the previously established baseline of 78.07. The authors also commit to making their code publicly available in the future. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The introduction of DTM positions itself as a significant advancement within the realm of diffusion models by offering a comprehensive framework that integrates diverse guidance strategies. By utilizing variational inference and control, the method presents a fresh perspective on enhancing model performance without the constraints of retraining or task-specific adaptations. **Significance:** The results underscore the practical applicability of DTM across various challenges in inverse problems, signifying its relevance not only in theoretical domains but also in real-world tasks where diffusion models are employed. Achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly in complex scenarios like non-linear deblurring, is indicative of DTM's potential impact. **Strengths:** - The methodological framework is well-defined and broad, potentially influencing future research and applications related to diffusion models and other generative approaches. - The authors provide substantial empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of their method, establishing a new benchmark for performance metrics in the contexts assessed. **Weaknesses:** - While the results are impressive, the paper primarily focuses on a limited set of problems. The generalizability of the DTM method to other applications beyond those presented remains to be explored. - The lack of comparison against an extensive range of guidance techniques could diminish the perceived impact of their approach in some discussions. **Overall Assessment:** The paper showcases a meaningful contribution that advances the application of diffusion models through a novel guidance method. DTM presents a robust framework that integrates existing techniques while achieving remarkable performance improvements. Its implications could be broadly influential in the fields of machine learning and computer vision. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the significant yet somewhat focused contribution of the paper. While it shows a strong advancement in diffusion model guidance, expansion into diverse application domains and further comparative analysis would enhance the robustness of the findings.

- **Authors**: Gian Mario Favero, Parham Saremi, Emily Kaczmarek, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel
- **Abstract**: Discriminative classifiers have become a foundational tool in deep learning for medical imaging, excelling at learning separable features of complex data distributions. However, these models often need careful design, augmentation, and training techniques to ensure safe and reliable deployment. Recently, diffusion models have become synonymous with generative modeling in 2D. These models showcase robustness across a range of tasks including natural image classification, where classification is performed by comparing reconstruction errors across images generated for each possible conditioning input. This work presents the first exploration of the potential of class conditional diffusion models for 2D medical image classification. First, we develop a novel majority voting scheme shown to improve the performance of medical diffusion classifiers. Next, extensive experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma skin cancer datasets demonstrate that foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models achieve competitive performance against SOTA discriminative classifiers without the need for explicit supervision. In addition, we show that diffusion classifiers are intrinsically explainable, and can be used to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions, increasing their trustworthiness and reliability in safety-critical, clinical contexts. Further information is available on our project page: https://faverogian.github.io/med-diffusion-classifier.github.io/
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the application of class conditional diffusion models as classifiers for 2D medical images, marking a novel intersection in the use of generative models for discriminative tasks. It introduces a novel majority voting technique to enhance classification performance and conducts experiments on the CheXpert and ISIC Melanoma datasets, demonstrating that both foundation and trained-from-scratch diffusion models can outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) discriminative classifiers without requiring extensive supervision. Additionally, the authors highlight the models' explainability and ability to quantify prediction uncertainty, proposing these features as advantages for deployment in clinical contexts. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance**:  This paper contributes to the evolving field of medical imaging by exploring an underutilized approach (diffusion models) in a domain primarily dominated by discriminative classifiers. By addressing a critical issue of explainability and uncertainty in medical diagnostics, the authors push towards more robust and understandable AI systems, which are necessary for clinical adoption. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The introduction of diffusion models as classifiers in medical imaging is a significant departure from traditional methods and holds promise for future applications. 2. **Performance**: The empirical results indicating competitive performance against SOTA models provide a strong basis for the proposed methods, suggesting that diffusion models can serve as effective alternatives. 3. **Explainability and Uncertainty**: The ability to interpret model predictions and assess uncertainty is crucial in medical settings, enhancing trust in automated systems. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Depth of Experimental Validation**: While the experiments on CheXpert and ISIC datasets are promising, the breadth of data types and conditions under which the models were tested is limited. Broadening the dataset variety could strengthen generalizability claims. 2. **Comparison with More Alternatives**: The comparative analysis focuses on SOTA discriminative models. Including other generative methods or hybrid approaches could provide a more nuanced understanding of the advantages and limitations of diffusion models. 3. **Implementation Complexity**: The paper does not thoroughly address the practical challenges of implementing diffusion models in clinical settings, particularly regarding computational efficiency and scalability. **Potential Influence**: This research has the potential to inspire new methodologies in medical imaging and related domains, encouraging further exploration of generative models. Its focus on explainability and uncertainty may drive demand for similar features in future medical AI applications. **Score: 8** This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, recognizing the innovative application of diffusion models in a critical area, albeit tempered by the need for further experimental validation and comparative analysis.

### A Comparison of DeepSeek and Other LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03688v1)
- **Authors**: Tianchen Gao, Jiashun Jin, Zheng Tracy Ke, Gabriel Moryoussef
- **Abstract**: Recently, DeepSeek has been the focus of attention in and beyond the AI community. An interesting problem is how DeepSeek compares to other large language models (LLMs). There are many tasks an LLM can do, and in this paper, we use the task of predicting an outcome using a short text for comparison. We consider two settings, an authorship classification setting and a citation classification setting. In the first one, the goal is to determine whether a short text is written by human or AI. In the second one, the goal is to classify a citation to one of four types using the textual content. For each experiment, we compare DeepSeek with $4$ popular LLMs: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama. We find that, in terms of classification accuracy, DeepSeek outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in most cases, but underperforms Claude. We also find that DeepSeek is comparably slower than others but with a low cost to use, while Claude is much more expensive than all the others. Finally, we find that in terms of similarity, the output of DeepSeek is most similar to those of Gemini and Claude (and among all $5$ LLMs, Claude and Gemini have the most similar outputs). In this paper, we also present a fully-labeled dataset collected by ourselves, and propose a recipe where we can use the LLMs and a recent data set, MADStat, to generate new data sets. The datasets in our paper can be used as benchmarks for future study on LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper compares DeepSeek, a recently highlighted large language model (LLM), to four established models: Claude, Gemini, GPT, and Llama. It focuses on two classification tasks: authorship classification (identifying texts as human or AI-generated) and citation classification (categorizing citations into four types). Research findings indicate that while DeepSeek typically outperforms Gemini, GPT, and Llama in classification accuracy, it does not surpass Claude. Additionally, DeepSeek's performance is noted to have a slower response time compared to peers, but it is more cost-effective than Claude, which is significantly more expensive. The similarity of outputs shows DeepSeek closest to Gemini and Claude. The paper also introduces a new fully-labeled dataset and proposes a methodology using LLMs along with the MADStat dataset for generating additional benchmark datasets for future LLM research. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper demonstrates novelty by providing a comparative analysis of DeepSeek against leading LLMs, which is crucial given the continuously evolving landscape of language models. The focus on two specific practical tasks (authorship and citation classification) addresses a relevant and current trend in AI and natural language processing (NLP), especially with the growing use of AI in generating text.  **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Rigor:** The inclusion of two distinct tasks allows for a multifaceted evaluation of DeepSeek, enhancing the reliability of the findings. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** By benchmarking against popular models, the paper offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate LLMs for specific tasks. 3. **Data Contribution:** The new labeled dataset is a significant advantage, enabling future research and encouraging reproducibility, which is often lacking in AI research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Performance Metrics:** While claiming superior performance, the lack of explicit details on the extent of improvement or statistical significance may limit the conclusions drawn about DeepSeek's effectiveness over its competitors. 2. **Limited Scope:** The comparison is limited to classification tasks; it would have been beneficial to include other types of tasks (such as generation or summarization) to truly assess DeepSeek’s versatility and robustness compared to existing models. 3. **Execution Time Concerns:** The noted slowness, while acknowledged, might dissuade adoption in real-time applications, but the paper does not explore ways to optimize this aspect. **Potential Influence:** This paper serves as a stepping stone in understanding the competitive landscape of LLMs, highlighting areas where newer models can improve. It provides practical benchmarks and a collaborative dataset, which could prompt further detailed studies and advances in language model development, ultimately influencing future research directions and applications. **Score Justification:** Taking into account the strengths of a well-rounded comparison methodology, the contribution of a new dataset, and the importance of the research question, combined with weaknesses related to scope and execution details, I would assign a score of 7. The work is significant and contributes to the field, but it could enhance its impact through deeper explorations and clearer metrics. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Bowen Jin, Jinsung Yoon, Zhen Qin, Ziqi Wang, Wei Xiong, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han, Sercan O. Arik
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.
- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper "LLM Alignment as Retriever Optimization: An Information Retrieval Perspective" addresses the challenge of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) for improved performance, focusing on their ethical and reliable use. It critiques existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods for their complexity and introduces a more straightforward approach utilizing Information Retrieval (IR) principles. The authors propose a framework linking LLM alignment and IR methodologies, culminating in the development of LarPO, an alignment method that optimizes LLMs as if they were IR systems. Experimental results demonstrate marked improvements in alignment quality, showcasing LarPO's potential as a novel contribution to LLM alignment. The authors argue that their approach opens up new research avenues by merging IR insights with LLM development. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:**   This paper introduces a fresh perspective on LLM alignment by marrying concepts from Information Retrieval with LLM optimization techniques. The novelty lies in the application of IR's retriever-reranker paradigm to optimize the alignment process. While the idea of simplifying complex optimization problems in AI is not entirely new, the specific integration of LLMs with IR methodologies is relatively unexplored territory, which is a strong point of this work. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The proposal of LarPO sets a new benchmark for aligning LLMs, moving away from the cumbersome RL techniques and thereby potentially increasing accessibility for practitioners in the field. 2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors provide substantial experimental results, with impressive improvement rates, which lend credibility to their claims and indicate practical applicability. Weaknesses include: 1. **Depth of Analysis**: While the approach is presented as novel, the integration and adaptation of existing IR techniques are somewhat superficial and may not fully exploit all nuances of IR methodologies that could be beneficial. 2. **Scalability and Generalization**: The paper does not deeply address the scalability of LarPO or its generalizability across varied task types and LLM architectures, which limits the practical implications of the work. The impact of this paper is promising; it has the potential to simplify LLM alignment and motivate further exploration of interdisciplinary techniques in AI. However, its full significance will depend on subsequent research validating and extending these findings across diverse models and tasks. **Score: 7**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03711v1)
- **Authors**: Nicole Cho, William Watson
- **Abstract**: One critical challenge in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs) stems from their propensity to hallucinate in generated responses. To address this, we propose MultiQ&A, a systematic approach for evaluating the robustness and consistency of LLM-generated answers. We demonstrate MultiQ&A's ability to crowdsource question perturbations and their respective answers through independent LLM agents at scale. Our experiments culminated in the examination of 1.9 million question perturbations and 2.3 million answers. Furthermore, MultiQ&A shows that ensembled LLMs, such as gpt-3.5-turbo, remain relatively robust and consistent under perturbations. MultiQ&A provides clarity in the response generation space, offering an effective method for inspecting disagreements and variability. Therefore, our system offers a potential framework for institutional LLM adoption with the ability to measure confidence, consistency, and the quantification of hallucinations.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "MultiQ&A: An Analysis in Measuring Robustness via Automated Crowdsourcing of Question Perturbations and Answers" addresses the issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), which poses a challenge for their adoption in institutional settings. The authors introduce a methodology named MultiQ&A that automates the process of generating question perturbations and gathering responses from independent LLM agents. Their approach successfully evaluates the robustness and consistency of LLM outputs, using an extensive dataset of 1.9 million perturbations and 2.3 million answers. The findings suggest that ensemble models, specifically gpt-3.5-turbo, maintain a notable level of robustness amid varied inputs. By facilitating the inspection of disagreements and variabilities in responses, MultiQ&A contributes a framework that supports measuring confidence and quantifying hallucinations, thereby enhancing the assessability of LLMs for institutional deployment. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:**  The paper introduces a systematic framework (MultiQ&A) for assessing LLM robustness, a current and pressing issue in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The scale of data analyzed is ambitious and demonstrates the potential of automated crowdsourcing to tackle complex evaluation tasks. Traditional methods for measuring output quality in LLMs often fall short in capturing the nuances of variability in responses, making this contribution particularly valuable. However, while the approach is innovative, the concept of perturbing questions and analyzing resulting answers is not entirely new. Previous works have explored similar techniques, albeit possibly on a smaller scale or without the comprehensive crowdsource aspect. This feature does lend the paper a degree of originality but does not revolutionize the field.  **Strengths:** 1. **Scale of Evaluation:** The analysis conducted over millions of question-answer pairs provides a robust statistical foundation for drawing conclusions about LLM performance. 2. **Practical Implications:** By offering a method to reliably measure output variability and confidence, the paper's framework has notable practical implications for institutions seeking to adopt LLM technology. 3. **Clarity in Results:** MultiQ&A addresses a significant need for transparency in LLM responses, thus promoting trust in AI systems. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Implementation Challenges:** While the paper outlines how MultiQ&A can be applied, it lacks a detailed discussion on potential implementation challenges that institutions may face when adopting this framework. 2. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** A more thorough comparison with other existing evaluation methodologies would strengthen the argument for the uniqueness and necessity of the proposed approach. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insights to the evaluation of LLMs, particularly regarding the spirited conversation around robustness and hallucination. Despite having some limitations and sharing elements with previous research, it offers a promising foundation for future investigations and applications within the field. ### Score: 7 This score reflects the paper's strong contribution to LLM evaluation methodologies while acknowledging its marginal novelty and the need for greater depth in implementation considerations and comparative analyses.

### Boosting Knowledge Graph-based Recommendations through Confidence-Aware Augmentation with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03715v1)
- **Authors**: Rui Cai, Chao Wang, Qianyi Cai, Dazhong Shen, Hui Xiong
- **Abstract**: Knowledge Graph-based recommendations have gained significant attention due to their ability to leverage rich semantic relationships. However, constructing and maintaining Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is resource-intensive, and the accuracy of KGs can suffer from noisy, outdated, or irrelevant triplets. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising way to improve the quality and relevance of KGs for recommendation tasks. Despite this, integrating LLMs into KG-based systems presents challenges, such as efficiently augmenting KGs, addressing hallucinations, and developing effective joint learning methods. In this paper, we propose the Confidence-aware KG-based Recommendation Framework with LLM Augmentation (CKG-LLMA), a novel framework that combines KGs and LLMs for recommendation task. The framework includes: (1) an LLM-based subgraph augmenter for enriching KGs with high-quality information, (2) a confidence-aware message propagation mechanism to filter noisy triplets, and (3) a dual-view contrastive learning method to integrate user-item interactions and KG data. Additionally, we employ a confidence-aware explanation generation process to guide LLMs in producing realistic explanations for recommendations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CKG-LLMA across multiple public datasets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Boosting Knowledge Graph-based Recommendations through Confidence-Aware Augmentation with Large Language Models" addresses the limitations of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in recommendation systems, which often face challenges such as resource-intensive construction and issues related to noisy or irrelevant triplets. The authors introduce the Confidence-aware KG-based Recommendation Framework with LLM Augmentation (CKG-LLMA), which aims to enhance KGs using Large Language Models. The framework consists of three main components: (1) a subgraph augmenter that enriches KGs with high-quality information generated by an LLM, (2) a confidence-aware message propagation mechanism that filters out noisy triplets, and (3) a dual-view contrastive learning method that integrates user-item interactions with KG data. Additionally, the authors propose a confidence-aware explanation generation process to improve the interpretability of recommendations. Their experimental results indicate that CKG-LLMA significantly improves recommendation effectiveness across various public datasets. --- **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** This paper represents a notable advancement in the intersection of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models. By proposing a holistic framework (CKG-LLMA) that incorporates multiple innovative components (LLM-based augmentation, confidence-aware propagation, and dual-view contrastive learning), it shows a clear effort to address existing limitations in KGs, particularly regarding noise and relevance. The use of confidence-aware mechanisms is particularly interesting, as it augments both data reliability and the interpretability of recommendations, two major hurdles in recommendation systems. However, while the concept of integrating LLMs with KGs is timely and relevant, similar approaches have been explored in earlier works, albeit perhaps not in the same comprehensive way that CKG-LLMA proposes. The novelty lies in the specific combination of techniques and the attention to confidence measures but doesn't entirely break new ground in concept. **Strengths:** 1. Comprehensive framework that effectively combines multiple state-of-the-art techniques for improvement. 2. Strong empirical support through extensive experiments, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methods. 3. Addresses key issues of noise in KGs and provides a method for generating informative explanations, enhancing user trust and system transparency. **Weaknesses:** 1. The reliance on LLMs can introduce risks, such as the potential for generating hallucinations, which the paper briefly addresses but does not extensively evaluate. 2. The practical implications of implementing this framework in real-world systems might not be fully detailed, particularly regarding computational efficiency and scalability. **Potential Influence:** Given the growing interest in enhancing recommendation systems using advanced AI techniques, this framework has the potential to spark further research into confidence-aware systems and the integration of emerging AI models with traditional methods. However, its true impact will depend on subsequent studies validating and refining these concepts in various application scenarios. Based on the presented information, the paper shows a commendable attempt at innovation within a well-explored field but doesn’t radically shift paradigms. Thus, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. **Score: 7**

### DICE: Distilling Classifier-Free Guidance into Text Embeddings
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03726v1)
- **Authors**: Zhenyu Zhou, Defang Chen, Can Wang, Chun Chen, Siwei Lyu
- **Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models are capable of generating high-quality images, but these images often fail to align closely with the given text prompts. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a popular and effective technique for improving text-image alignment in the generative process. However, using CFG introduces significant computational overhead and deviates from the established theoretical foundations of diffusion models. In this paper, we present DIstilling CFG by enhancing text Embeddings (DICE), a novel approach that removes the reliance on CFG in the generative process while maintaining the benefits it provides. DICE distills a CFG-based text-to-image diffusion model into a CFG-free version by refining text embeddings to replicate CFG-based directions. In this way, we avoid the computational and theoretical drawbacks of CFG, enabling high-quality, well-aligned image generation at a fast sampling speed. Extensive experiments on multiple Stable Diffusion v1.5 variants, SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$ demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, DICE supports negative prompts for image editing to improve image quality further. Code will be available soon.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "DICE: Distilling Classifier-Free Guidance into Text Embeddings" introduces a novel method, DICE, which addresses the limitations associated with classifier-free guidance (CFG) in text-to-image diffusion models. While CFG is effective in enhancing the alignment of generated images with text prompts, it comes with computational burdens and diverges from the theoretical framework of diffusion models. The authors propose that DICE can distill CFG into a more efficient process by refining text embeddings so that they emulate the contributions of CFG without requiring its implementation. This innovation leads to improved image quality and alignment, and the method is validated through extensive experiments on various variants of Stable Diffusion, demonstrating its potential for faster sampling speeds. DICE also allows for negative prompts, enhancing image editing capabilities. The promise of forthcoming code availability suggests a commitment to enabling further research and practical applications. ### Critical Evaluation The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of text-to-image generation by addressing the computational inefficiencies and theoretical inconsistencies associated with CFG. The elimination of CFG reliance through innovative text embedding refinement is a notable contribution, particularly as it provides a pathway for faster image generation without compromising the quality of alignment with text prompts. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: DICE presents an original method to improve text-to-image generative models, deviating from traditional CFG dependence while preserving its benefits. 2. **Efficiency**: By streamlining the generative process, DICE potentially enables quicker model inference, which is crucial for real-time applications in image generation. 3. **Experimental Validation**: The authors back their claims with extensive experiments on various models, reinforcing the reliability of their results and findings. 4. **Broader Applications**: The inclusion of negative prompts for image editing broadens the utility of the method beyond mere generation to creative modifications, which can be impactful for users in fields such as design and media. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparison**: While the presentation of results is extensive, the paper could benefit from more comparative analysis against other existing methods beyond CFG, particularly in terms of performance metrics and qualitative assessments. 2. **Theoretical Justifications**: Although the practical application is strong, more theoretical rationale underpinning the claimed improvements would strengthen the overall arguments presented in the paper. In conclusion, while the innovation put forth in the DICE method is commendable and has the potential to influence how text-to-image diffusion models are approached in the future, there may be limitations in theoretical exposition and comparative analysis. The strengths of novelty and applicability are substantial, supporting a favorable evaluation. **Score: 8**

### Rethinking the Residual Distribution of Locate-then-Editing Methods in Model Editing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03748v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaopeng Li, Shanwen Wang, Shasha Li, Shezheng Song, Bin Ji, Jun Ma, Jie Yu
- **Abstract**: Model editing is a powerful technique for updating the knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). Locate-then-edit methods are a popular class of approaches that first identify the critical layers storing knowledge, then compute the residual of the last critical layer based on the edited knowledge, and finally perform multi-layer updates using a least-squares solution by evenly distributing the residual from the first critical layer to the last. Although these methods achieve promising results, they have been shown to degrade the original knowledge of LLMs. We argue that residual distribution leads to this issue. To explore this, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of residual distribution in locate-then-edit methods from both empirical and theoretical perspectives, revealing that residual distribution introduces editing errors, leading to inaccurate edits. To address this issue, we propose the Boundary Layer UpdatE (BLUE) strategy to enhance locate-then-edit methods. Sequential batch editing experiments on three LLMs and two datasets demonstrate that BLUE not only delivers an average performance improvement of 35.59\%, significantly advancing the state of the art in model editing, but also enhances the preservation of LLMs' general capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/xpq-tech/BLUE.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Rethinking the Residual Distribution of Locate-then-Editing Methods in Model Editing" addresses the effectiveness of locate-then-edit methods used for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors highlight that while these methods allow for effective knowledge updating, they can inadvertently degrade existing knowledge due to how residual information is distributed across layers. Through both empirical and theoretical analysis, the research demonstrates that this residual distribution can lead to editing errors and inaccuracies in the model’s performance. To counteract these issues, the authors propose the Boundary Layer UpdatE (BLUE) strategy, which has shown significant improvements in model editing performance—an average enhancement of 35.59%—across three LLMs and two datasets, while maintaining the models' overall capabilities. The authors provide their code openly for further use within the community. **Evaluation:** This paper presents a significant advancement in the model editing landscape, particularly within the context of LLMs. The identification and critique of the residual distribution process in locate-then-edit methods expose an important flaw that is not commonly addressed, adding valuable insight to the field. The introduction of the Boundary Layer UpdatE (BLUE) strategy is a novel contribution that not only mitigates the identified weaknesses but also provides substantial performance improvements. The methodological rigor of the paper is commendable, with both empirical and theoretical analyses bolstering the claims made. The use of multiple LLMs and datasets strengthens the overall findings and suggests a broad applicability of the proposed method. However, the paper could benefit from further exploration regarding the potential limitations of BLUE. It remains unclear how this method may perform under various circumstances or with different model architectures, which could affect its generalizability. Additionally, more comprehensive comparisons with existing methods could further clarify BLUE's advantages and potential drawbacks. Overall, while the work is a significant contribution to the field, emphasizing the criticality of effective residual handling in model editing and introducing a promising new strategy, the need for broader evaluation and exploration of limitations detracts slightly from its full impact. **Score: 8**

### Hierarchical Contextual Manifold Alignment for Structuring Latent Representations in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03766v1)
- **Authors**: Meiquan Dong, Haoran Liu, Yan Huang, Zixuan Feng, Jianhong Tang, Ruoxi Wang
- **Abstract**: The organization of latent token representations plays a crucial role in determining the stability, generalization, and contextual consistency of language models, yet conventional approaches to embedding refinement often rely on parameter modifications that introduce additional computational overhead. A hierarchical alignment method was introduced to restructure token embeddings without altering core model weights, ensuring that representational distributions maintained coherence across different linguistic contexts. Experimental evaluations demonstrated improvements in rare token retrieval, adversarial robustness, and long-range dependency tracking, highlighting the advantages of hierarchical structuring in mitigating inconsistencies in latent space organization. The comparative analysis against conventional fine-tuning and embedding perturbation methods revealed that hierarchical restructuring maintained computational efficiency while achieving measurable gains in representation quality. Structural refinements introduced through the alignment process resulted in improved contextual stability across varied linguistic tasks, reducing inconsistencies in token proximity relationships and enhancing interpretability in language generation. A detailed computational assessment confirmed that the realignment process introduced minimal inference overhead, ensuring that representational improvements did not compromise model efficiency. The findings reinforced the broader significance of structured representation learning, illustrating that hierarchical embedding modifications could serve as an effective strategy for refining latent space distributions while preserving pre-learned semantic associations.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Hierarchical Contextual Manifold Alignment for Structuring Latent Representations in Large Language Models" presents a novel method for restructuring latent token embeddings in language models without modifying their core weights. This hierarchical alignment approach addresses the challenges in organizing token representations, improving stability, generalization, and contextual consistency while avoiding the computational overhead associated with traditional embedding refinements. Experimental results indicate benefits in various aspects, such as rare token retrieval, adversarial robustness, and long-range dependency tracking. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods, the proposed technique enhances representation quality efficiently with minimal inference overhead. The study highlights the importance of structured representation learning in improving the organization of latent spaces and argues that hierarchical adjustments can refine distributions of embeddings while retaining existing semantic structures. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a fresh concept in the landscape of language model fine-tuning by focusing on hierarchical realignment rather than conventional parameter adjustments.

- **Abstract**: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks as the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with early detection being crucial for improving patient survival rates. However, early screening for HCC using ultrasound suffers from insufficient sensitivity and is highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists for interpretation. Leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, this study proposes an innovative Hierarchical Sparse Query Transformer (HSQformer) model that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance the accuracy of HCC diagnosis in ultrasound screening. The HSQformer leverages sparse latent space representations to capture hierarchical details at various granularities without the need for complex adjustments, and adopts a modular, plug-and-play design philosophy, ensuring the model's versatility and ease of use. The HSQformer's performance was rigorously tested across three distinct clinical scenarios: single-center, multi-center, and high-risk patient testing. In each of these settings, it consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models, such as ConvNext and SwinTransformer. Notably, the HSQformer even matched the diagnostic capabilities of senior radiologists and comprehensively surpassed those of junior radiologists. The experimental results from this study strongly demonstrate the effectiveness and clinical potential of AI-assisted tools in HCC screening. The full code is available at https://github.com/Asunatan/HSQformer.

- **Authors**: Ruishi Zou, Yinqi Tang, Jingzhu Chen, Siyu Lu, Yan Lu, Yingfan Yang, Chen Ye
- **Abstract**: Data-rich documents are ubiquitous in various applications, yet they often rely solely on textual descriptions to convey data insights. Prior research primarily focused on providing visualization-centric augmentation to data-rich documents. However, few have explored using automatically generated word-scale visualizations to enhance the document-centric reading process. As an exploratory step, we propose GistVis, an automatic pipeline that extracts and visualizes data insight from text descriptions. GistVis decomposes the generation process into four modules: Discoverer, Annotator, Extractor, and Visualizer, with the first three modules utilizing the capabilities of large language models and the fourth using visualization design knowledge. Technical evaluation including a comparative study on Discoverer and an ablation study on Annotator reveals decent performance of GistVis. Meanwhile, the user study (N=12) showed that GistVis could generate satisfactory word-scale visualizations, indicating its effectiveness in facilitating users' understanding of data-rich documents (+5.6% accuracy) while significantly reducing their mental demand (p=0.016) and perceived effort (p=0.033).
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces GistVis, a novel automated pipeline designed to enhance the understanding of data-rich documents through the generation of word-scale visualizations. Recognizing the limitations of existing approaches that focus predominantly on textual descriptions, GistVis aims to bridge this gap by creating visual representations that complement text. The pipeline consists of four modules: Discoverer, Annotator, Extractor, and Visualizer. The first three modules employ large language models to extract insights, while the Visualizer integrates visualization design principles. Technical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of GistVis, with a user study involving 12 participants showing improved comprehension (5.6% accuracy increase) and reduced cognitive load (p=0.016) and perceived effort (p=0.033). ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** GistVis presents a fresh approach to automating the visualization of data insights from textual sources, a domain that has not been extensively addressed in prior research. The proposal to create word-scale visualizations represents a significant shift from traditional visualization methods, which often rely on larger, static images or charts. By integrating the capabilities of large language models with visualization design knowledge, GistVis potentially sets a new standard in document-centric visualization efforts. **Significance:** The significance of GistVis lies in its ability to make complex data more accessible through visual means, thereby enhancing user comprehension and reducing cognitive load. Given the growing amount of data embedded within textual documents across various fields, such an innovation can have wide-ranging applications from academic research to industry reports, making it highly relevant in today's information-rich environment. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of LLMs with visualization techniques offers a novel method for tackling the challenges presented by data-rich documents. 2. **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors provide both technical evaluations and user studies to substantiate their claims, indicating thoroughness in their research methodology. 3. **Practical Implications:** The reduced cognitive load and perceived effort suggest that GistVis could significantly improve the reading and understanding experience for users dealing with complex data. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Sample Size:** The user study involved only 12 participants, which raises questions about the generalizability of the results. Larger studies would be needed to confirm the findings across a broader population. 2. **Exploratory Nature:** While the pipeline shows promise, the paper should further elaborate on the scalability and adaptability of GistVis to various types of data-rich documents, particularly those with diverse formats and contexts. 3. **Technical Depth:** Depending on the audience, the technical evaluation sections could be further developed to offer more detailed insights into the methods used in performance comparisons. **Overall Influence:** GistVis has the potential to influence the fields of data visualization and document processing significantly. By automating the generation of visual insights, it could encourage more researchers and practitioners to incorporate visualization into their data communications, potentially leading to a broader cultural shift in how data is presented and understood. ### Score: 7 This score reflects GistVis's innovative approach and its practical implications, balanced with the concerns regarding the generalizability of its findings and a need for additional technical depth. The development of a tool that integrates language modeling with visualization represents a valuable addition to the field, but further research is warranted to fully assess its impact and usability in diverse scenarios.

- **Authors**: Jacob Fein-Ashley
- **Abstract**: We introduce a unified framework for iterative reasoning that leverages non-Euclidean geometry via Bregman divergences, higher-order operator averaging, and adaptive feedback mechanisms. Our analysis establishes that, under mild smoothness and contractivity assumptions, a generalized update scheme not only unifies classical methods such as mirror descent and dynamic programming but also captures modern chain-of-thought reasoning processes in large language models. In particular, we prove that our accelerated iterative update achieves an $O(1/t^2)$ convergence rate in the absence of persistent perturbations, and we further demonstrate that feedback (iterative) architectures are necessary to approximate certain fixed-point functions efficiently. These theoretical insights bridge classical acceleration techniques with contemporary applications in neural computation and optimization.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Iterate to Accelerate: A Unified Framework for Iterative Reasoning and Feedback Convergence" presents a novel framework for iterative reasoning that integrates concepts from non-Euclidean geometry, specifically Bregman divergences, with higher-order operator averaging and adaptive feedback mechanisms. The authors demonstrate that their generalized update scheme not only synthesizes traditional methods like mirror descent and dynamic programming but also accommodates advanced reasoning processes found in large language models.

- **Authors**: Benjamin Clavié, Nathan Cooper, Benjamin Warner
- **Abstract**: While encoder-only models such as BERT and ModernBERT are ubiquitous in real-world NLP applications, their conventional reliance on task-specific classification heads can limit their applicability compared to decoder-based large language models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce ModernBERT-Large-Instruct, a 0.4B-parameter encoder model that leverages its masked language modelling (MLM) head for generative classification. Our approach employs an intentionally simple training loop and inference mechanism that requires no heavy pre-processing, heavily engineered prompting, or architectural modifications. ModernBERT-Large-Instruct exhibits strong zero-shot performance on both classification and knowledge-based tasks, outperforming similarly sized LLMs on MMLU and achieving 93% of Llama3-1B's MMLU performance with 60% less parameters. We also demonstrate that, when fine-tuned, the generative approach using the MLM head matches or even surpasses traditional classification-head methods across diverse NLU tasks.This capability emerges specifically in models trained on contemporary, diverse data mixes, with models trained on lower volume, less-diverse data yielding considerably weaker performance. Although preliminary, these results demonstrate the potential of using the original generative masked language modelling head over traditional task-specific heads for downstream tasks. Our work suggests that further exploration into this area is warranted, highlighting many avenues for future improvements.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper "It's All in The [MASK]: Simple Instruction-Tuning Enables BERT-like Masked Language Models As Generative Classifiers" presents an innovative approach to enhance traditional encoder-only models like BERT through the use of their masked language modeling (MLM) capabilities for generative classification tasks. The authors propose ModernBERT-Large-Instruct, a 0.4 billion parameter model that simplifies the training and inference processes, avoiding complex pre-processing and prompting strategies. The results indicate that this model achieves strong zero-shot performance on classification and knowledge-based tasks, outperforming similar-sized large language models (LLMs), while achieving notable performance with significantly fewer parameters. The effectiveness of the generative model is particularly highlighted in its ability to match or exceed the performance of typical classification heads after fine-tuning, especially when trained on diverse datasets. The findings suggest potential directions for further research, particularly in leveraging generative modeling methods over conventional task-specific heads for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty and Practicality:** The concept of utilizing the MLM head as a generative classifier is innovative, putting an interesting twist on existing models while avoiding the complexity often associated with larger LLMs. 2. **Efficiency:** The paper emphasizes efficiency in model design, achieving competitive performance with considerably fewer parameters. This aligns with growing concerns in the field regarding the resource intensity of training and deploying large models. 3. **Strong Empirical Results:** The claim of outperforming similarly sized LLMs on specific benchmarks like MMLU demonstrates the robustness of the methodology and provides empirical evidence that supports the thesis. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Exploration of Model Variability:** While the paper suggests the method's potential, it lacks detailed exploration of different training data configurations. The significant performance dependency on data diversity may pose a challenge in real-world scenarios, where data quality and availability vary widely. 2. **Preliminary Nature of Findings:** The results are described as preliminary. Thus, the generalizability of the findings remains uncertain, and further studies are necessary to establish broader applicability across various domains and dataset types. 3. **Comparison with Traditional Methods:** While the generative approach shows promise, the paper could benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis with various standard approaches to provide a clearer context of the proposed method’s advantages. **Potential Influence:** The approach taken in this paper may influence future research in the field of natural language processing, particularly among researchers exploring efficient model designs and generative capabilities of traditional architectures. The introduction of simpler yet effective training methods could inspire new directions in both theoretical and applied NLP. **Score Justification:** Considering the strengths of innovative approaches and the practical implications of enhancing existing models, the paper represents a significant contribution to the field. However, the limitations related to exploratory depth and empirical generalizability slightly temper its impact. Thus, the paper earns a score reflective of balanced novelty, potential influence, and execution quality. **Score: 7**

### Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Noise Injection
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03799v1)
- **Authors**: Litian Liu, Reza Pourreza, Sunny Panchal, Apratim Bhattacharyya, Yao Qin, Roland Memisevic
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating plausible yet incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Effectively detecting hallucinations is therefore crucial for the safe deployment of LLMs. Recent research has linked hallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that hallucinations can be detected by measuring dispersion over answer distributions obtained from a set of samples drawn from a model. While drawing from the distribution over tokens defined by the model is a natural way to obtain samples, in this work, we argue that it is sub-optimal for the purpose of detecting hallucinations. We show that detection can be improved significantly by taking into account model uncertainty in the Bayesian sense. To this end, we propose a very simple and efficient approach that perturbs an appropriate subset of model parameters, or equivalently hidden unit activations, during sampling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across a wide range of datasets and model architectures.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Enhancing Hallucination Detection through Noise Injection" addresses the challenge of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)—incorrect yet plausible outputs generated by these models. It builds on prior findings that relate hallucinations to model uncertainty, suggesting that these can be detected by analyzing the dispersion in answer distributions from sampled outputs. However, the authors argue that the conventional method of sampling from the token distribution is insufficient for accurate detection of hallucinations. Instead, they propose a novel approach that involves perturbing a selection of model parameters or hidden unit activations during the sampling process, informed by Bayesian measures of uncertainty. The effectiveness of this noise injection method is validated across various datasets and model architectures, indicating significant improvements in hallucination detection. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The concept of enhancing hallucination detection through noise injection is novel, as it shifts away from purely sampling the token distribution, focusing instead on a more nuanced understanding of uncertainty in model outputs. The use of perturbation of model parameters or activations is a relatively underexplored idea in the context of hallucination detection in LLMs. While related work has touched upon uncertainty, the paper’s specific method of implementation and validation showcases originality. **Significance:** The significance of this work is high, given the ongoing challenges of deploying LLMs in real-world applications where safety and reliability are paramount. By providing a more robust methodology for hallucination detection, the authors are contributing to the broader goal of enhancing the trustworthiness of AI systems. Moreover, the approach appears to be efficient and practical, allowing for potential widespread application. **Strengths:** 1. **Original Approach:** The noise injection methodology stands out as a significant advancement in detection techniques. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The effectiveness demonstrated across multiple datasets and architectures strengthens the claims made by the authors, suggesting that the method is not limited to a specific context. 3. **Clarity and Accessibility:** The paper is well-structured, making complex ideas accessible and understandable. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns:** While the method shows promise, potential issues with scalability or computational overhead when applied to extremely large models remain unaddressed.  2. **Broader Comparison:** The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with other contemporary methods for hallucination detection to more clearly delineate its advantages or limitations. 3. **Scope of Datasets:** Although multiple datasets are used, the paper would be stronger with additional insights into how the method performs under varying contexts, such as different domains or languages. **Overall Assessment:** In summary, the paper presents a compelling new method for hallucination detection that not only advances understanding of model uncertainty but also offers practical applications for improving LLM reliability. The balance of novelty, empirical support, and practical implications places the work as a noteworthy contribution to the field. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yusuke Miura, Chi-Lan Yang, Masaki Kuribayashi, Keigo Matsumoto, Hideaki Kuzuoka, Shigeo Morishima
- **Abstract**: Replying to formal emails is time-consuming and cognitively demanding, as it requires polite phrasing and ensuring an adequate response to the sender's demands. Although systems with Large Language Models (LLM) were designed to simplify the email replying process, users still needed to provide detailed prompts to obtain the expected output. Therefore, we proposed and evaluated an LLM-powered question-and-answer (QA)-based approach for users to reply to emails by answering a set of simple and short questions generated from the incoming email. We developed a prototype system, ResQ, and conducted controlled and field experiments with 12 and 8 participants. Our results demonstrated that QA-based approach improves the efficiency of replying to emails and reduces workload while maintaining email quality compared to a conventional prompt-based approach that requires users to craft appropriate prompts to obtain email drafts. We discuss how QA-based approach influences the email reply process and interpersonal relationship dynamics, as well as the opportunities and challenges associated with using a QA-based approach in AI-mediated communication.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to improve the process of replying to formal emails by utilizing a question-and-answer (QA) system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors acknowledge that crafting suitable responses to formal emails is often time-consuming and mentally taxing, primarily due to the need for polite phrasing and follow-up on the sender's requests. Traditional LLM systems require users to manually input detailed prompts to generate adequate replies. In contrast, the proposed system, named ResQ, generates simple questions based on the content of incoming emails, allowing users to respond by answering these questions rather than crafting prompts. This study involved controlled and field experiments with 20 participants, demonstrating that the QA-based method improves efficiency and reduces the cognitive load associated with email replies, while still maintaining the quality of the responses. Furthermore, the paper discusses the implications of this approach for the email communication process and interpersonal dynamics, highlighting both the advantages and potential challenges of employing AI in communication. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: As email remains a critical form of communication in professional settings, enhancing the efficiency of email replies is highly relevant. The integration of AI technologies into such tasks is an important area of research, making the study timely. 2. **Novel Approach**: The shift from traditional prompt-based LLM interaction to a simple QA interaction is innovative. It addresses a significant bottleneck in current AI email response systems and opens a new avenue for research in AI-supported communication. 3. **Empirical Evidence**: The authors conducted both controlled and field experiments, providing empirical data to support their claims about increased efficiency and decreased cognitive load. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Sample Size and Diversity**: With only 20 participants, the sample size is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The demographic diversity of participants may also affect the applicability of the results to broader populations. 2. **Long-Term Implications**: The paper does not deeply explore the long-term consequences of relying on AI for email communication, such as potential changes in communication skills, misunderstanding, or over-reliance on technology. 3. **Interpersonal Dynamics**: While the discussion around interpersonal relationships is touched upon, it lacks depth. The potential for miscommunication or reduced personal touch in professional relationships when using AI systems needs further exploration. **Novelty and Significance**: The concept of linking LLMs with a QA-based interface for formal email communication presents a fresh perspective in the field of AI-mediated communication. It has practical applications and could lead to further advancements in email automation, making it significant. However, the study's limitations—such as sample size, exploration depth, and broader implications—dilute its impact to some extent. Based on the above analysis, **I assign the paper a score of 7**. The work is commendable for introducing an innovative framework and providing valuable insights into AI-assisted email responses. Still, it falls short of achieving higher impact due to methodological limitations and a lack of comprehensive discussion on the broader implications of its findings. Score: 7

### Identify Critical KV Cache in LLM Inference from an Output Perturbation Perspective
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03805v1)
- **Authors**: Yuan Feng, Junlin Lv, Yukun Cao, Xike Xie, S Kevin Zhou
- **Abstract**: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing but face significant challenges of high storage and runtime costs, due to the transformer architecture's reliance on self-attention, particularly the large Key-Value (KV) cache for long-sequence inference. Recent efforts to reduce KV cache size by pruning less critical entries based on attention weights remain empirical and lack formal grounding. This paper presents a formal study on identifying critical KV cache entries by analyzing attention output perturbation. Our analysis reveals that, beyond attention weights, the value states within KV entries and pretrained parameter matrices are also crucial. Based on this, we propose a perturbation-constrained selection algorithm that optimizes the worst-case output perturbation to identify critical entries. Evaluations on the Needle-in-a-Haystack test and Longbench benchmark show our algorithm enhances state-of-the-art cache eviction methods. Further empirical analysis confirms that our algorithm achieves lower output perturbations in over 92% attention heads in Llama model, thereby providing a significant improvement over existing methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Identify Critical KV Cache in LLM Inference from an Output Perturbation Perspective" addresses the high storage and runtime costs associated with large language models, particularly due to the dependence on the Key-Value (KV) cache in transformer architectures for long-sequence inference. Existing methods for reducing the KV cache size through pruning lack empirical and theoretical grounding. This study employs a formal approach to identify critical KV cache entries by analyzing the output perturbation resulting from changes in these entries. The authors propose a novel perturbation-constrained selection algorithm aimed at optimizing the worst-case output perturbation, thereby allowing for effective identification of critical entries. Evaluations using two benchmarks demonstrate that their algorithm performs significantly better than previous state-of-the-art cache eviction methods, achieving lower output perturbations in the majority of attention heads in the Llama model. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the approach to optimizing KV cache management in large language models. One of the key strengths is the introduction of a formal framework that not only utilizes attention weights but also incorporates the dynamics of value states within KV cache entries and pretrained parameter matrices. This broader perspective on what constitutes critical information within the KV cache is a notable contribution and fills a gap in the existing literature. Additionally, the perturbation-constrained selection algorithm is both innovative and practical, as it directly tackles the issue of output quality degradation, which is a major concern in model inference. The rigorous benchmarks used (Needle-in-a-Haystack and Longbench) provide a solid basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed method, lending credibility to the results obtained. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. While the approach highlights the importance of managing the KV cache effectively, the broader implications concerning model generalization and the impact on diverse types of language tasks remain underspecified. Furthermore, the empirical analysis is limited to specific models (e.g., the Llama model), and further examinations across varied architectures could strengthen the generalizability of the findings. A broader discussion on the computational complexity of implementing this approach versus its benefits would also enrich the paper. **Score: 8**   The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of NLP and large language models by formally addressing the optimization of KV caches through an innovative approach. While it presents substantial advancements, the work could be improved by expanding its applicability and discussing its implications in greater depth. Nevertheless, the high performance of the proposed method and its grounding in a formal analysis justify a strong score.

### DeblurDiff: Real-World Image Deblurring with Generative Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03810v1)
- **Authors**: Lingshun Kong, Jiawei Zhang, Dongqing Zou, Jimmy Ren, Xiaohe Wu, Jiangxin Dong, Jinshan Pan
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have achieved significant progress in image generation. The pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) models are helpful for image deblurring by providing clear image priors. However, directly using a blurry image or pre-deblurred one as a conditional control for SD will either hinder accurate structure extraction or make the results overly dependent on the deblurring network. In this work, we propose a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) to achieve robust real-world image deblurring. Specifically, we co-train the LKPN in latent space with conditional diffusion. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel to guide the restoration of sharp images in the latent space. By applying element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC), the learned kernel is utilized to adaptively process the input feature, effectively preserving the structural information of the input. This process thereby more effectively guides the generative process of Stable Diffusion (SD), enhancing both the deblurring efficacy and the quality of detail reconstruction. Moreover, the results at each diffusion step are utilized to iteratively estimate the kernels in LKPN to better restore the sharp latent by EAC. This iterative refinement enhances the accuracy and robustness of the deblurring process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on both benchmark and real-world images.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DeblurDiff: Real-World Image Deblurring with Generative Diffusion Models" presents a novel approach to image deblurring using generative diffusion models, specifically a Latent Kernel Prediction Network (LKPN) that operates in latent space alongside a conditional diffusion process. The LKPN learns a spatially variant kernel for deblurring, employing element-wise adaptive convolution (EAC) to maintain structural integrity in images during the restoration process. Additionally, the method improves by iteratively refining kernel estimates at each diffusion step, significantly enhancing both deblurring results and detail reconstruction. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques on various benchmarks and real-world scenarios. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a commendable advancement in the field of image processing, particularly by integrating diffusion models with a mechanism to adaptively predict and utilize deblurring kernels. The idea of co-training in latent space with simultaneous kernel learning is a valuable contribution, potentially offering a more robust alternative to existing methods limited by their dependence on initial conditions or prior deblurring efforts. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The integration of LKPN with diffusion models to handle latent representations for deblurring is innovative and contributes new techniques to the field. 2. **Technical Contribution**: The use of spatially variant kernels and EAC allows the model to retain critical structural information, addressing a common pitfall in traditional deblurring methods. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimental results substantiate the claims made, showcasing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: The additional complexity introduced by the training and iterative refinement processes may pose practical challenges for real-time applications or in resource-constrained environments. 2. **Generalization**: While the results are impressive, the generalizability of the technique to all types of blurs or various image contexts remains to be tested more thoroughly. **Impact on the Field**: The paper's approach has the potential to influence future research in generative models and image restoration. The methodology could inspire further studies into latent representations and kernel prediction, broadening the scope of image deblurring strategies. **Score**: 8 This score reflects a recognition of the innovative principles and technical contributions presented, balanced by a consideration of complexity and potential limitations in practical settings. The paper is a significant contribution that is likely to motivate further advancements in the field, making it a noteworthy addition to the literature on image deblurring techniques.

### PsyPlay: Personality-Infused Role-Playing Conversational Agents
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03821v1)
- **Authors**: Tao Yang, Yuhua Zhu, Xiaojun Quan, Cong Liu, Qifan Wang
- **Abstract**: The current research on Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focuses on imitating specific speaking styles and utilizing character backgrounds, neglecting the depiction of deeper personality traits.~In this study, we introduce personality-infused role-playing for LLM agents, which encourages agents to accurately portray their designated personality traits during dialogues. We then propose PsyPlay, a dialogue generation framework that facilitates the expression of rich personalities among multiple LLM agents. Specifically, PsyPlay enables agents to assume roles with distinct personality traits and engage in discussions centered around specific topics, consistently exhibiting their designated personality traits throughout the interactions. Validation on generated dialogue data demonstrates that PsyPlay can accurately portray the intended personality traits, achieving an overall success rate of 80.31% on GPT-3.5. Notably, we observe that LLMs aligned with positive values are more successful in portraying positive personality roles compared to negative ones. Moreover, we construct a dialogue corpus for personality-infused role-playing, called PsyPlay-Bench. The corpus, which consists of 4745 instances of correctly portrayed dialogues using PsyPlay, aims to further facilitate research in personalized role-playing and dialogue personality detection.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "PsyPlay: Personality-Infused Role-Playing Conversational Agents" addresses a gap in existing research on Role-Playing Conversational Agents (RPCAs) by introducing a system that emphasizes the inclusion of deeper personality traits in dialogues, rather than limiting character representation to speaking styles and backgrounds. The authors present PsyPlay, a dialogue generation framework that allows multiple LLM agents to embody distinct personalities during their interactions while discussing specific topics. The framework was validated through testing, achieving an accuracy rate of 80.31% in portraying designated personality traits on GPT-3.5. Furthermore, the study highlights that LLMs aligned with positive values tend to better express positive personalities than negative ones. Additionally, the authors created a dialogue corpus—PsyPlay-Bench—comprising 4,745 instances of dialogues that exemplify accurately portrayed personality interactions, thus aiding future research in personalized role-playing and dialogue personality detection. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper presents a significant advancement by focusing on the intricate representation of personality traits in RPCAs, moving beyond surface-level character imitation prevalent in prior studies. This introduction of a structured framework (PsyPlay) for personality-infused dialogues is a noteworthy contribution, as it fills a notable gap in the literature regarding the expression of character depth and emotional complexity in AI-driven conversations. Additionally, the creation of the PsyPlay-Bench corpus provides a valuable resource for future research, enhancing the paper's innovative value. **Significance**: The implications of this research are considerable, particularly in improving the realism and engagement of conversational agents in various applications, from gaming to therapeutic contexts. By demonstrating measurable success in personality portrayal, the authors lay a foundation for further investigations into personality detection and the customization of LLM responses based on character traits. **Strengths**: - The paper showcases a clear methodological framework that can be replicated in future work. - The success rate of 80.31% indicates a promising start towards advanced personality integration in LLMs. - The construction of a dedicated dialogue corpus supports reproducibility and provides a basis for subsequent research. **Weaknesses**: - While the results are promising, the scope of tested personality traits may be limited, potentially resulting in biases or an incomplete portrayal of the wider personality landscape. - The reliance on a single LLM (GPT-3.5) for validation may limit generalizability across different models or versions. - More extensive comparative analysis with other existing methods for character portrayal would strengthen the argument for PsyPlay's effectiveness. **Overall Assessment**: While the paper makes a commendable contribution to the field of AI dialogue systems by integrating personality traits into conversational agents, it would benefit from broader testing across various contexts and additional character traits. Nonetheless, the introduction of the PsyPlay framework and the corpus significantly enriches ongoing research efforts. **Score**: 8

### Syntriever: How to Train Your Retriever with Synthetic Data from LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03824v1)
- **Authors**: Minsang Kim, Seungjun Baek
- **Abstract**: LLMs have boosted progress in many AI applications. Recently, there were attempts to distill the vast knowledge of LLMs into information retrieval systems. Those distillation methods mostly use output probabilities of LLMs which are unavailable in the latest black-box LLMs. We propose Syntriever, a training framework for retrievers using synthetic data from black-box LLMs. Syntriever consists of two stages. Firstly in the distillation stage, we synthesize relevant and plausibly irrelevant passages and augmented queries using chain-of-thoughts for the given queries. LLM is asked to self-verify the synthetic data for possible hallucinations, after which retrievers are trained with a loss designed to cluster the embeddings of relevant passages. Secondly in the alignment stage, we align the retriever with the preferences of LLMs. We propose a preference modeling called partial Plackett-Luce ranking to learn LLM preferences with regularization which prevents the model from deviating excessively from that trained in the distillation stage. Experiments show that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performances on benchmark datasets from various domains in nDCG@$K$. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/kmswin1/Syntriever}{https://github.com/kmswin1/Syntriever}.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces **Syntriever**, a novel framework designed to enhance information retrieval systems by utilizing synthetic data generated from black-box large language models (LLMs). Given the limitations of current distillation methods that rely on output probabilities, which are often unavailable in black-box LLMs, Syntriever proposes a two-stage training process.  1. **Distillation Stage**: This initial phase synthesizes both relevant and implausibly irrelevant passages as well as augmented queries through a chain-of-thought approach. The LLM undergoes a self-verification step to minimize hallucinated outputs, leading to a focused training regime for the retrievers aimed at tightly clustering relevant passage embeddings. 2. **Alignment Stage**: The retriever is then aligned with LLM preferences using a new preference modeling technique called partial Plackett-Luce ranking. This approach incorporates regularization to ensure that the retriever's performance remains consistent with its training in the first stage. Empirical results demonstrate that Syntriever achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of domains as measured by normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) at different thresholds (K). The authors make their code publicly available to encourage further research and replication of results.  --- ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper presents a novel approach to training retrievers by leveraging synthetic data from black-box LLMs, filling a significant gap in the field. Traditional methods for retriever training often rely on more transparent models or hard-coded datasets, which may not capture the complexity or variability provided by modern LLMs. By focusing on synthetic data generation and alignment with LLM preferences, the authors break new ground and expand the capabilities and robustness of retrieval systems. **Strengths**: - **Innovative Approach**: The use of synthetic data from LLMs to train retrievers, particularly those that cannot be easily probed for intermediates or probabilities, is a significant advancement. - **Rigorous Methodology**: The two-stage process is well-defined, with clear justifications for each phase. - **Empirical Validation**: Achievement of state-of-the-art results demonstrates the effectiveness of their method, indicating a solid contribution to the research community. - **Accessibility of Code**: Providing open access to their implementation encourages further exploration and validation of their approach. **Weaknesses**: - **Dependence on LLM Quality**: The effectiveness of Syntriever inherently relies on the quality of the underlying LLM used for generating synthetic data. Poorly performing LLMs may lead to less effective training and retrieval outcomes. - **Hallucination Handling**: While self-verification is proposed to reduce hallucinations, the paper does not elaborate on how effectively this takes place or how it compares with other existing methods that may already tackle this problem. - **Potential Overfitting**: The reliance on synthetic data might lead to overfitting to the characteristics of that synthetic data, which could pose issues in real-world application scenarios where data may not be well-represented in the training set. **Influence on the Field**: The introduction of techniques like Syntriever could lead to widespread adoption in the AI retrieval domain, especially as LLMs continue to grow in popularity and capability. The paper's implications for improving retrieval systems using synthetic data could inspire further work in this area, potentially integrating similar techniques across various models and applications. ### Score: 8 **Rationale for the Score**: Given its innovative methodology, thorough empirical validation, and the potential for significant influence on retrieval systems, the paper deserves a high score. However, some weaknesses—particularly the dependence on LLMs' quality and the handling of hallucinations—prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, its contributions are substantial enough to warrant an 8, reflecting both novelty and impact while acknowledging the areas for improvement.

### FairT2I: Mitigating Social Bias in Text-to-Image Generation via Large Language Model-Assisted Detection and Attribute Rebalancing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03826v1)
- **Authors**: Jinya Sakurai, Issei Sato
- **Abstract**: The proliferation of Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized content creation, providing powerful tools for diverse applications ranging from artistic expression to educational material development and marketing. Despite these technological advancements, significant ethical concerns arise from these models' reliance on large-scale datasets that often contain inherent societal biases. These biases are further amplified when AI-generated content is included in training data, potentially reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes in the generated outputs. In this paper, we introduce FairT2I, a novel framework that harnesses large language models to detect and mitigate social biases in T2I generation. Our framework comprises two key components: (1) an LLM-based bias detection module that identifies potential social biases in generated images based on text prompts, and (2) an attribute rebalancing module that fine-tunes sensitive attributes within the T2I model to mitigate identified biases. Our extensive experiments across various T2I models and datasets show that FairT2I can significantly reduce bias while maintaining high-quality image generation. We conducted both qualitative user studies and quantitative non-parametric analyses in the generated image feature space, building upon the occupational dataset introduced in the Stable Bias study. Our results show that FairT2I successfully mitigates social biases and enhances the diversity of sensitive attributes in generated images. We further demonstrate, using the P2 dataset, that our framework can detect subtle biases that are challenging for human observers to perceive, extending beyond occupation-related prompts. On the basis of these findings, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for evaluating bias in T2I models.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "FairT2I: Mitigating Social Bias in Text-to-Image Generation via Large Language Model-Assisted Detection and Attribute Rebalancing" addresses the critical issue of social bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models, which have transformed content generation but often propagate societal stereotypes found in their training data. The authors introduce FairT2I, a framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to identify and mitigate biases during the T2I generation process. It consists of two main components: a bias detection module powered by an LLM that assesses potential biases in images produced from text prompts and an attribute rebalancing module that adjusts sensitive attributes to counteract identified biases. The framework is evaluated through extensive experiments, indicating that FairT2I effectively reduces bias while preserving high image quality. Furthermore, the authors conduct user studies and quantitative analyses demonstrating the framework's ability to detect subtle biases and enhance diversity in sensitive attributes, leading to the introduction of a new benchmark dataset for systematic evaluation of bias in T2I models. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: FairT2I's combination of LLM-based bias detection with attribute rebalancing is a novel approach in addressing biases inherent in T2I systems. This dual-modality leverages the strengths of LLMs, which have shown significant capabilities in understanding contextual subtleties in language, thus providing a fresh perspective on bias mitigation. 2. **Addressing an Important Issue**: The concerns around societal bias in AI systems are particularly pertinent given the increasing deployment of T2I models in various industries. FairT2I's focus on mitigating these biases constitutes a timely response to ethical challenges in AI, which could resonate well with both academic and industrial stakeholders. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experiments and user studies provide a solid foundation for the proposed framework, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing diversity and reducing bias in generated images. The introduction of a new benchmark dataset for evaluating biases in T2I models contributes to the literature, offering a valuable resource for future research. 4. **Broader Impact Potential**: The implications of mitigating bias extend beyond technical performance, as addressing ethical concerns can enhance public trust in AI technologies. Thus, FairT2I holds significant potential for influencing policies and practices related to AI ethics. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: The integrated approach using LLMs alongside T2I models may pose challenges in terms of implementation complexity and computational requirements, which could limit its accessibility for smaller organizations or individual researchers. 2. **Scope of Study**: While the paper presents results across various datasets, it may benefit from broader explorations of existing biases in diverse cultural contexts. The central focus on occupational biases may overlook other significant societal stereotypes that could be equally pervasive. 3. **Benchmark Limitations**: The introduction of a new benchmark dataset is useful, but the paper does not elaborate on its creation process or how comprehensive it is across different bias categories. This could affect the replicability and generalizability of their findings. **Score: 8**  **Justification**: The paper presents a significant contribution to the field of AI ethics, especially concerning T2I models. By introducing a comprehensive and novel framework to detect and mitigate social biases, it tackles an urgent problem with practical implications. Although the complexity and potential limitations in the scope of bias examined are notable, the strength of empirical validation and the clear ethical motivation underpinning the research support a high score. An 8 indicates strong importance and appreciation for its contributions while acknowledging areas for improvement and expansion.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03829v1)
- **Authors**: Guohao Huo, Ruiting Dai, Ling Shao, Hao Tang
- **Abstract**: Image segmentation is a critical task in visual understanding. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are predisposed to capture high-frequency features in images, while Transformers exhibit a contrasting focus on low-frequency features. In this paper, we experimentally quantify the contrast sensitivity function of CNNs and compare it with that of the human visual system, informed by the seminal experiments of Mannos and Sakrison. Leveraging these insights, we propose the Wavelet-Guided Spectral Pooling Module (WSPM) to enhance and balance image features across the frequency domain. To further emulate the human visual system, we introduce the Frequency Domain Enhanced Receptive Field Block (FE-RFB), which integrates WSPM to extract enriched features from the frequency domain. Building on these innovations, we develop FE-UNet, a model that utilizes SAM2 as its backbone and incorporates Hiera-Large as a pre-trained block, designed to enhance generalization capabilities while ensuring high segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that FE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks, including marine animal and polyp segmentation, underscoring its versatility and effectiveness.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces a novel image segmentation model, FE-UNet, which combines elements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers to enhance image features across different frequency domains. It establishes a theoretical foundation by comparing the frequency response of CNNs against the human visual system’s capabilities. The authors propose two key innovations: the Wavelet-Guided Spectral Pooling Module (WSPM) and the Frequency Domain Enhanced Receptive Field Block (FE-RFB). These modules work together to improve the model's ability to capture both high and low-frequency features. FE-UNet employs SAM2 as its backbone and integrates Hiera-Large as a pre-trained component, leading to superior performance in various segmentation tasks, specifically in marine animal and polyp segmentation. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of frequency domain techniques with segmentation architectures is a novel contribution. The analysis comparing CNNs with the human visual system provides a strong theoretical basis for the proposed methods, demonstrating a well-thought-out research approach. 2. **State-of-the-Art Results**: The experimental outcomes showcase the model's effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, suggesting that the innovations do lead to meaningful improvements in segmentation tasks. 3. **Versatility**: The application of the model to different types of segmentation (marine animals and polyps) indicates its robustness and ability to adapt to various imaging scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: Introducing multiple new modules (WSPM and FE-RFB) may complicate the architecture, potentially making it more challenging to implement and generalize in different settings. 2. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While the paper claims state-of-the-art performance, further comparative analysis against recent models is necessary to thoroughly validate its claims, particularly in real-world applications. 3. **Clarity and Accessibility**: The precise mechanisms of how the frequency domain enhancements improve feature representation could be better explained, especially for practitioners who may wish to adopt the methodology. **Overall Contribution**: The main novelty lies in the fusion of insights from human vision with machine learning principles to achieve better image segmentation. If further studies confirm the generalizability of the model in other contexts, it could significantly impact the field of computer vision, particularly in medical and biological applications. **Score**: 8 The score reflects a high level of innovation and demonstrated effectiveness but also considers the potential challenges in broad adoption and implementation. The strengths of theoretical grounding and experimental validation are substantial, warranting a favorable evaluation, although some gaps in comparative analysis and practical implications keep it from receiving a perfect score.

### Improving Natural Language Understanding for LLMs via Large-Scale Instruction Synthesis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03843v1)
- **Authors**: Lin Yuan, Jun Xu, Honghao Gui, Mengshu Sun, Zhiqiang Zhang, Lei Liang, Jun Zhou
- **Abstract**: High-quality, large-scale instructions are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs), however, there is a severe shortage of instruction in the field of natural language understanding (NLU). Previous works on constructing NLU instructions mainly focus on information extraction (IE), neglecting tasks such as machine reading comprehension, question answering, and text classification. Furthermore, the lack of diversity in the data has led to a decreased generalization ability of trained LLMs in other NLU tasks and a noticeable decline in the fundamental model's general capabilities. To address this issue, we propose Hum, a large-scale, high-quality synthetic instruction corpus for NLU tasks, designed to enhance the NLU capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, Hum includes IE (either close IE or open IE), machine reading comprehension, text classification, and instruction generalist tasks, thereby enriching task diversity. Additionally, we introduce a human-LLMs collaborative mechanism to synthesize instructions, which enriches instruction diversity by incorporating guidelines, preference rules, and format variants. We conduct extensive experiments on 5 NLU tasks and 28 general capability evaluation datasets for LLMs. Experimental results show that Hum enhances the NLU capabilities of six LLMs by an average of 3.1\%, with no significant decline observed in other general capabilities.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a solution to the challenge of insufficient high-quality, large-scale instructions for training large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding (NLU). The authors highlight that existing instruction datasets primarily focus on information extraction, neglecting other critical NLU tasks like machine reading comprehension, question answering, and text classification. To address this gap, they introduce a synthetic instruction corpus named Hum, which encompasses a variety of NLU tasks, enhancing diversity and supporting the training of LLMs. A novel collaborative mechanism involving human input and LLMs helps to generate diverse instructions by integrating various guidelines and formatting options. Experimental results demonstrate that the Hum corpus improves the NLU performance of six different LLMs by an average of 3.1%, without significantly impacting their general capabilities. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The paper's contribution lies in addressing a specific gap in the existing research on NLU, presenting a novel synthetic dataset aimed at enhancing the capabilities of LLMs for diverse tasks.  **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensive Approach**: The concept of synthesizing a broad range of instructional material for NLU tasks is a significant advance because it recognizes the importance of having diverse datasets that bolster model performance across various tasks. 2. **Collaborative Mechanism**: The introduction of a human-LLM collaborative instruction synthesis method is innovative and may yield better-quality corpus through user participation and LLM outputs, which could serve as a template for future research in similar domains. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The extensive experimental evaluation across multiple tasks and model architectures provides strong evidence of the utility of the proposed approach, showcasing measurable improvements. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the paper claims improvements in NLU tasks, the impact on real-world applications or more abstract reasoning tasks remains unaddressed. The paper would benefit from discussing the limitations of synthetic data and its effect on model consistency in practical scenarios. 2. **Lack of Comparison with Other Methods**: The novelty could be further highlighted by contrasting Hum’s effectiveness with existing instruction synthesis techniques. Comparisons could clarify how Hum specifically overcomes limitations of prior works. 3. **Narrow Focus**: Although the diversity of tasks is increased, the broader implications on model learning (e.g., transfer learning scenarios) and how this approach might generalize to other domains remains undeveloped. In terms of impact, this research can provide valuable insights and tools for future works focusing on NLU task diversification and could be particularly relevant for developers training models in specific bounded contexts with diverse needs. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to the field of NLU, while acknowledging that there are gaps that prevent it from being classified as groundbreaking. The proposed solutions are commendable and potentially influential, yet further exploration into their implications and robustness is necessary to establish a more comprehensive framework for future improvements in LLM training. **Score: 7**

### BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without Distillation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03860v1)
- **Authors**: Bo Pang, Hanze Dong, Jiacheng Xu, Silvio Savarese, Yingbo Zhou, Caiming Xiong
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs), such as o1 from OpenAI, have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities. o1 generates a long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) before answering a question. LongCoT allows LLMs to analyze problems, devise plans, reflect, and backtrack effectively. These actions empower LLM to solve complex problems. After the release of o1, many teams have attempted to replicate its LongCoT and reasoning capabilities. In terms of methods, they primarily rely on knowledge distillation with data from existing models with LongCoT capacities (e.g., OpenAI-o1, Qwen-QwQ, DeepSeek-R1-Preview), leaving significant uncertainties on systematically developing such reasoning abilities. In terms of data domains, these works focus narrowly on math while a few others include coding, limiting their generalizability. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable LLM's LongCoT capacity without distillation from o1-like models or expensive human annotations, where we bootstrap LongCoT (BOLT) from a standard instruct model. BOLT involves three stages: 1) LongCoT data bootstrapping with in-context learning on a standard instruct model; 2) LongCoT supervised finetuning; 3) online training to further refine LongCoT capacities. In BOLT, only a few in-context examples need to be constructed during the bootstrapping stage; in our experiments, we created 10 examples, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach. We use Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to bootstrap LongCoT and apply our method to various model scales (7B, 8B, 70B). We achieve impressive performance on a variety of benchmarks, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, WildBench, ZebraLogic, MATH500, which evaluate diverse task-solving and reasoning capabilities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without Distillation" presents a novel method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through a process called Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought (BOLT). Traditional approaches to emulate the LongCoT reasoning capacities of models like OpenAI's o1 have primarily relied on knowledge distillation, often focusing narrowly on specific domains such as mathematics. The BOLT approach is designed to be more systematic and generalizable, employing a three-stage process: (1) LongCoT data bootstrapping using in-context learning with a standard instruct model, (2) supervised fine-tuning of LongCoT, and (3) online training for additional refinement. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their method by employing a small number of in-context examples (10) and reported significant improvements across various benchmarks, thereby highlighting the potential for achieving advanced reasoning capabilities in a cost-effective and scalable manner. **Evaluation:** The BOLT paper offers a thoughtful contribution to the field of language models and reasoning. One of its key strengths lies in its innovative approach to developing LongCoT capabilities without relying on knowledge distillation, thus addressing a gap in the existing literature surrounding model training techniques. The methodology is practical and demonstrates that substantial reasoning enhancements can be achieved with minimal data input, which may encourage further exploration into efficient training methods for LLMs. However, the paper does have some weaknesses. While the benchmarks chosen for evaluation show a range of task-solving capabilities, it would benefit from a wider variety of tasks to fully gauge the generalizability of the BOLT method. Additionally, the specificity of the setup using Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct raises questions about reproducibility across other models, as the generalization claim relies heavily on a single instruct model. In terms of novelty, while the approach diverges from conventional methods, it does share common traits with previous strategies focused on in-context learning. As such, while it can provide incremental advancements in reasoning, it may not represent a seismic shift in the field. Considering these factors—its contributions to efficient model training, the potential for broader application, but also its reliance on specific setups and a somewhat narrow focus on benchmarks—this paper merits a score of **7**. This score reflects a solid contribution with room for further exploration and validation in diverse contexts. **Score: 7**

### Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion for Ransomware Detection: A Probabilistic Approach to Behavioral Anomaly Isolation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03882v1)
- **Authors**: Vasili Iskorohodov, Maximilian Ravensdale, Matthias von Holstein, Hugo Petrovic, Adrian Yardley
- **Abstract**: The increasing complexity of cryptographic extortion techniques has necessitated the development of adaptive detection frameworks capable of identifying adversarial encryption behaviors without reliance on predefined signatures. Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED) introduces a structured entropy-based anomaly classification mechanism that systematically tracks fluctuations in entropy evolution to differentiate between benign cryptographic processes and unauthorized encryption attempts. The integration of hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic diffusion modeling refines detection granularity, ensuring that encryption anomalies are identified despite obfuscation strategies or incremental execution methodologies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated that HED maintained high classification accuracy across diverse ransomware families, outperforming traditional heuristic-based and signature-driven approaches while reducing false positive occurrences. Comparative analysis highlighted that entropy-driven anomaly segmentation improved detection efficiency under variable system workload conditions, ensuring real-time classification feasibility. The computational overhead associated with entropy anomaly detection remained within operational constraints, reinforcing the suitability of entropy-driven classification for large-scale deployment. The ability to identify adversarial entropy manipulations before encryption completion contributes to broader cybersecurity defenses, offering a structured methodology for isolating unauthorized cryptographic activities within heterogeneous computing environments. The results further emphasized that entropy evolution modeling facilitates predictive anomaly detection, enhancing resilience against encryption evasion techniques designed to circumvent traditional detection mechanisms.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion for Ransomware Detection: A Probabilistic Approach to Behavioral Anomaly Isolation" presents a novel methodology for detecting ransomware through an entropy-based classification system known as Hierarchical Entropic Diffusion (HED). This system addresses the shortcomings of traditional signature-based detection methods by tracking entropy fluctuations to distinguish between legitimate and unauthorized cryptographic activities. By employing hierarchical clustering, entropy profiling, and probabilistic modeling, the authors propose a method that effectively maintains high classification accuracy across various ransomware types, minimizes false positives, and can operate efficiently under different system loads. The results indicate that HED not only enables early detection of encryption threats but also represents a feasible solution for large-scale deployment in enhancing cybersecurity frameworks, particularly in handling obfuscated or subtle encryption maneuvers. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces a relatively new approach to ransomware detection by leveraging entropy-based methods, which is a noteworthy shift from traditional practices that largely rely on signature matching. The integration of hierarchical clustering and probabilistic modeling is design-wise innovative, offering a structured way to enhance anomaly detection. However, while the concept is refreshing, the research does not fully explore previously established modeling frameworks or existing literature on anomaly detection using entropy measures, limiting its contextual framing within the broader research landscape. **Significance:** The significance of HED lies in its potential practical applications. The capability to predict and isolate malicious encryption before completion stands to bolster defense mechanisms against evolving ransomware threats. This could substantially impact cybersecurity strategies, offering organizations a more adaptive tool in their arsenal. Nevertheless, the paper could further outline long-term implications and broader applicability to other domains within cybersecurity beyond ransomware. **Strengths:** 1. **Performance:** The experimental results showing improved accuracy and reduced false positives represent a solid contribution to the field. 2. **Wide Applicability:** The method's adaptability to various system workloads enhances its practical deployment prospects. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of thorough comparison:** While traditional methods were mentioned, the paper could benefit from deeper comparative analysis against other emerging detection frameworks. 2. **Scalability Concerns:** Although the paper mentions operational constraints, there is little discussion on scaling the method for environments with extreme loads or diverse architectures. Overall, the contributions are relevant and timely, particularly as ransomware tactics evolve. However, the novelty may not be as pronounced when placed in the context of existing techniques, and additional comparisons and explorations would enhance the work's impact. **Score:** 7 This score reflects a strong contribution to ransomware detection through a novel approach, tempered by a lack of comprehensive validation against existing methodologies and potential scalability discussions. The research offers practical insights but does not fully leverage the broader context of anomaly detection literature.

### Rank Also Matters: Hierarchical Configuration for Mixture of Adapter Experts in LLM Fine-Tuning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03884v1)
- **Authors**: Peizhuang Cong, Wenpu Liu, Wenhan Yu, Haochen Zhao, Tong Yang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various tasks, accompanied by a continuous increase in their parameter size. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. Recent studies have integrated LoRA with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, leveraging multiple adapter experts and gating mechanisms to further improve fine-tuning performance. However, existing approaches primarily focus on adjusting the allocations of adapter experts per layer to optimize the introduced trainable parameter size, while neglecting a critical factor of adapters' rank. To this end, we propose a hierarchical scheme for expert allocation and rank configuration, HILO, which dynamically adjusts the number and rank of adapter experts across layers, matching the varying representational complexity of model layers in adapter-granularity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate that HILO outperforms existing methods in accuracy while introducing fewer trainable parameters, providing an efficient and practical solution for fine-tuning LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Rank Also Matters: Hierarchical Configuration for Mixture of Adapter Experts in LLM Fine-Tuning" proposes a novel framework, referred to as HILO, aiming to enhance the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). Building on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the authors critique existing methods for neglecting the importance of adapter rank alongside the number of adapter experts allocated per layer. HILO introduces a hierarchical allocation system that dynamically configures both the quantity and rank of adapter experts across model layers, which is aligned with the varying complexity inherent in different layers of the LLM architecture. Through extensive experimentation on benchmark tasks, the authors provide evidence that HILO achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods while utilizing fewer trainable parameters. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of adapter rank consideration into the mixture of experts framework is an innovative contribution to the field. It highlights an important aspect of model tuning that has been overlooked. 2. **Focus on Efficiency**: By reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining high accuracy, HILO addresses the critical issue of computational efficiency, which is a significant concern in deploying large-scale LLMs. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide extensive empirical results validating their framework, which strengthens their claims and offers practical insights for researchers and practitioners working with LLMs. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Incremental Nature**: While the proposed method introduces a new dimension to expert allocation, the overall improvement might be viewed as incremental within the broader context of existing fine-tuning techniques. The research does not fundamentally alter the landscape but refines an aspect of it. 2. **Simplicity of Presentation**: The details regarding how the hierarchical scheme is implemented and its computational overhead are not extensively discussed, which could affect the reproducibility and applicability of the method in various contexts. 3. **Generalizability**: The experiments are limited to specific benchmark tasks; the generalizability of HILO's effectiveness across a wider range of real-world applications remains uncertain. **Impact and Potential Influence:** This paper makes a valuable contribution to the literature on fine-tuning LLMs, particularly in its emphasis on both the number and rank of adapter experts. It opens new avenues for research in adapter-based and parameter-efficient approaches, suggesting directions for future explorations that could further optimize model performance. However, its incremental nature and certain limitations in presentation may hinder its immediate widespread adoption. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to the field, particularly its innovative framework and focus on efficiency, while also noting the incremental improvements and lack of thorough presentation in certain areas that could limit its influence.

### Experiments with Large Language Models on Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Closed-Source Simulation Software
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03916v1)
- **Authors**: Andreas Baumann, Peter Eberhard
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly helpful in text generation, even writing code in programming languages based on user prompts written in natural language. They are even applied to generate simulation models for multibody systems from natural language. Research results suggest that LLMs surpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have been trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for closed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their ideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones. LLMs can hallucinate for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper explores the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating simulation models for closed-source simulation software, focusing on the potential of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. While LLMs have shown abilities in generating code and models from natural language prompts, their performance with closed-source software is uncertain because of the proprietary nature and differing methodologies compared to open-source projects. The study conducts experiments using two RAG systems to assess LLMs' knowledge about closed-source software and their model creation capabilities. The results indicate that RAG can enhance LLM performance in this context, but also expose shortcomings in the information provided. The paper highlights avenues for further research to improve the reliability of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks involving proprietary software. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper addresses a significant gap in the field, particularly regarding the application of LLMs in contexts involving closed-source software. While research on LLMs predominantly focuses on open-source frameworks, the unique challenges posed by closed proprietary systems have been less explored. The introduction of the RAG approach as a possible solution to knowledge-access issues in this context adds a novel perspective to the ongoing discussions about LLM capabilities. This is especially relevant given the rising importance of proprietary algorithms and software in various industries, where accessing internal knowledge is often pivotal. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The paper tackles a timely and pertinent problem, given the ubiquity of closed-source systems in the tech industry. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** By conducting experiments, the authors provide empirical data, which strengthens their claims about the potential utility of RAG in enhancing LLM performance. 3. **Exploratory Nature:** The preliminary findings are promising and indicate a direction for future investigations, which could motivate further research in this essential area. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The experiments and examples provided may be insufficient to draw broad conclusions about the effectiveness of RAG systems across different types of closed-source software. 2. **Validation of Results:** There is a lack of comprehensive validation or comparative analysis with other methods, making it difficult to gauge the true effectiveness of RAG compared to traditional approaches. 3. **Gaps in Information:** While the paper acknowledges the limitations and gaps in LLM knowledge, it does not provide concrete strategies for overcoming these challenges, leaving the research somewhat incomplete. **Potential Influence:** While the paper presents a valuable exploration of LLMs in a niche area, the overall impact may be limited by its preliminary nature and the challenges identified. However, it opens essential questions and lays the groundwork for subsequent studies, which could amplify its significance over time. **Score Justification:** Considering the strengths in addressing a critical issue and the novel application of a RAG approach, the paper exhibits noteworthy contributions to the field. However, the limitations related to the scope, validation, and concrete solutions somewhat diminish its overall impact. Hence, the paper earns a score of 7, reflecting its potential influence while recognizing the need for further development and exploration. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Speech technologies are transforming interactions across various sectors, from healthcare to call centers and robots, yet their performance on African-accented conversations remains underexplored. We introduce Afrispeech-Dialog, a benchmark dataset of 50 simulated medical and non-medical African-accented English conversations, designed to evaluate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and related technologies. We assess state-of-the-art (SOTA) speaker diarization and ASR systems on long-form, accented speech, comparing their performance with native accents and discover a 10%+ performance degradation. Additionally, we explore medical conversation summarization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to demonstrate the impact of ASR errors on downstream medical summaries, providing insights into the challenges and opportunities for speech technologies in the Global South. Our work highlights the need for more inclusive datasets to advance conversational AI in low-resource settings.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Afrispeech-Dialog, a benchmark dataset comprising 50 simulated conversations in African-accented English, aimed at evaluating automatic speech recognition (ASR) and related technologies in both medical and non-medical contexts. The authors highlight the performance gap of state-of-the-art ASR systems when processing accented speech, noting a deterioration of over 10% compared to native accents. The paper also analyzes how errors in ASR affect the summarization capabilities of large language models in medical contexts. By emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, the authors argue for advancing conversational AI technologies in low-resource settings, particularly within the Global South. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its address of a significant gap in speech technology research that often overlooks non-native accents, specifically in the African context. By providing a benchmark dataset for African-accented conversations, it not only contributes a valuable resource for further research but also raises awareness of the biases present in current ASR systems. The findings revealing a performance decline of over 10% for accented speech compared to native accents showcase the real-world implications for healthcare applications, which is particularly timely and relevant as global health systems increasingly adopt digital platforms. However, the study has certain limitations. While the dataset comprised 50 conversations, it may not fully capture the diverse range of accents and dialects across the continent, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, while the exploratory analysis of ASR errors impacting LLM performance is significant, the methodological framework could have been elaborated further to better assess different contexts and models, providing deeper insights into the variances of performance. Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution by emphasizing the necessity of inclusive datasets and generating discussion around the challenges faced by speech technologies in low-resource environments. The potential influence on the field appears strong, as it encourages the development and consideration of more culturally representative technologies in AI research. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to the field, addressing a critical need for diversity in datasets, yet acknowledges potential limitations in the comprehensiveness and methodological rigor of the presented solutions.

### MAQInstruct: Instruction-based Unified Event Relation Extraction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03954v1)
- **Authors**: Jun Xu, Mengshu Sun, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou
- **Abstract**: Extracting event relations that deviate from known schemas has proven challenging for previous methods based on multi-class classification, MASK prediction, or prototype matching. Recent advancements in large language models have shown impressive performance through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, in the task of event relation extraction, instruction-based methods face several challenges: there are a vast number of inference samples, and the relations between events are non-sequential. To tackle these challenges, we present an improved instruction-based event relation extraction framework named MAQInstruct. Firstly, we transform the task from extracting event relations using given event-event instructions to selecting events using given event-relation instructions, which reduces the number of samples required for inference. Then, by incorporating a bipartite matching loss, we reduce the dependency of the instruction-based method on the generation sequence. Our experimental results demonstrate that MAQInstruct significantly improves the performance of event relation extraction across multiple LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces MAQInstruct, a novel framework for event relation extraction that seeks to address the limitations of existing instruction-based methods. Traditional approaches have struggled with multi-class classification and schema variations, while recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the potential of instruction tuning. MAQInstruct innovatively reframes the task by shifting from extracting event relations based on event-event instructions to selecting relevant events guided by event-relation instructions. This transformation minimizes the number of inference samples required. Additionally, the incorporation of a bipartite matching loss mechanism aims to lessen the reliance on the sequence of generation, enhancing the robustness of the extraction process. The authors report substantial performance improvements of MAQInstruct on various LLMs when compared to existing methods. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The redefinition of the task and the use of event-relation instructions are pivotal shifts that potentially streamline the inference process. This shows theoretical advancement and practical applicability. 2. **Performance Improvement:** The experimental results indicating significant performance gains across multiple LLMs suggest that MAQInstruct is a viable solution to the challenges posed in event relation extraction. 3. **Addressing Challenges:** The paper effectively identifies the shortcomings of traditional methods, such as sample size and sequence dependency, and proposes specific solutions to tackle these issues. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Samples:** While the reduction of samples is beneficial, the paper does not adequately explore the potential limitations or downsides of this approach, such as the risk of oversimplifying the complexity of event relations in larger datasets. 2. **Dependency on LLMs:** The performance improvements heavily rely on LLMs, which may limit the applicability of the proposed framework in contexts where such models are not available or feasible for deployment. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis:** Although the presented results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis involving a broader array of existing methods beyond the few cited. **Significance in the Field:** MAQInstruct appears to redefine the landscape of instruction-based event relation extraction, particularly within the context of LLM utilization. As the need for robust event analysis continues to grow in natural language processing applications such as information retrieval and automated knowledge extraction, this framework could lay the groundwork for more advanced systems. ### Conclusion Taking into account the innovative contributions and some limitations noted, the MAQInstruct paper represents a notable advance in the field of event relation extraction, especially in the context of instruction-based and LLM methods. Its practical implications and improvements over previous methodologies warrant a generally favorable assessment. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's commendable contributions while acknowledging areas where further exploration and validation are required to fully realize the extent of its impact on the field.

- **Authors**: Jiaxi Yang, Haowen Hou
- **Abstract**: Existing Visual Language Modelsoften struggle with information loss and limited reasoning abilities when handling high-resolution web interfaces that combine complex visual, textual, and interactive elements. These challenges are particularly evident in tasks requiring webpage layout comprehension and multi-step interactive reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose RWKV-UI, a Visual Language Model based on the RWKV architecture, specifically designed to handle high-resolution UI images. During model training, we introduce layout detection as a visual prompt to help the model better understand the webpage layout structures. Additionally, we design a visual prompt based on the Chain-of-Thought(CoT) mechanism, which enhances the model's ability to understand and reason about webpage content through reasoning chains. Experimental results show that RWKV-UI demonstrates significant performance improvements in high-resolution UI understanding and interactive reasoning tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "RWKV-UI: UI Understanding with Enhanced Perception and Reasoning" addresses the limitations of existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) in comprehending complex web interfaces. These challenges arise particularly in tasks that require high-resolution image analysis and multi-step reasoning regarding layout and interactive elements. To improve upon these limitations, the authors propose RWKV-UI, a model inspired by the RWKV architecture specifically tailored for high-resolution UI images. The innovation hinges on two main contributions: the integration of layout detection as a visual prompt during training to assist in understanding webpage structures, and the development of a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) visual prompt to facilitate reasoning about the content. Experimental results indicate that RWKV-UI outperforms existing models in both layout comprehension and interactive reasoning tasks. --- **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a notable advancement in the area of Visual Language Models, specifically targeting the understanding of web interfaces with high fidelity. The application of layout detection as a visual prompt is a fresh approach that could indeed enhance how models interpret spatial relationships within content. Similarly, the implementation of the Chain-of-Thought mechanism tailored for visual contexts represents a significant innovation since it could bridge the gap between visual perception and interactive reasoning. **Strengths:** 1. **Focused Approach:** The RWKV-UI model is specifically designed to tackle the challenges of high-resolution UI images, which is a relevant and growing area of research as more complex web interfaces emerge. 2. **Methodological Contributions:** The use of layout detection and reasoning chains can help create more robust models that can process visual and textual information holistically. 3. **Empirical Results:** The authors back their claims with experimental results that demonstrate marked improvements over existing models, indicating that their approach is indeed effective. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Impact on Broader Applications:** While the paper focuses on UI understanding, it remains to be seen how the methods can be generalized or adapted to other domains in computer vision and natural language processing. This could limit its broader applicability. 2. **Complexity and Scalability:** Introducing additional prompts for layout and reasoning could increase model complexity and may not necessarily scale well with even more intricate interfaces or novel web technologies. 3. **Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks:** It is critical to evaluate how the model performs against a diverse set of benchmarks, particularly those that reflect real-world situations rather than controlled experiments. **Influence on the Field:** RWKV-UI has the potential to influence future research by setting a foundation for improved reasoning in visual language models, particularly in applications that require a nuanced understanding of interactive elements. However, its impact will be more pronounced if the findings can be validated in broader contexts beyond high-resolution UIs. **Conclusion:** In summary, RWKV-UI demonstrates promising advancements in visual-language understanding, specifically for web interfaces. However, its limited applicability and potential challenges in scalability warrant a cautious appreciation of its impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with valuable insights and methodologies, yet recognizes the need for further validation and broader applicability to establish it as an exceptional contribution.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03997v1)
- **Authors**: Yu Yuan, Shizhao Sun, Qi Liu, Jiang Bian
- **Abstract**: Computer Aided Design (CAD) is indispensable across various industries. \emph{Text-based CAD editing}, which automates the modification of CAD models based on textual instructions, holds great potential but remains underexplored. Existing methods primarily focus on design variation generation or text-based CAD generation, either lacking support for text-based control or neglecting existing CAD models as constraints. We introduce \emph{CAD-Editor}, the first framework for text-based CAD editing. To address the challenge of demanding triplet data with accurate correspondence for training, we propose an automated data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to generate pairs of original and edited CAD models and employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to summarize their differences into editing instructions. To tackle the composite nature of text-based CAD editing, we propose a locate-then-infill framework that decomposes the task into two focused sub-tasks: locating regions requiring modification and infilling these regions with appropriate edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the backbone for both sub-tasks, leveraging their capabilities in natural language understanding and CAD knowledge. Experiments show that CAD-Editor achieves superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents CAD-Editor, a novel framework for text-based CAD editing that automates modifications to CAD models based on textual instructions. Unlike existing methods that focus on design variations or text generation without considering existing models, CAD-Editor leverages an automated data synthesis pipeline to generate training data. This pipeline utilizes design variation models to create pairs of original and edited CAD models, with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) summarizing their differences into editing instructions. The framework addresses the complexity of text-based CAD editing through a two-step process: locating modification areas and infilling them with edits. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide the foundation for both tasks. Experimental results indicate that CAD-Editor outperforms existing approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The CAD-Editor framework presents several significant innovations in the realm of computer-aided design, particularly in text-based editing. Firstly, it is one of the few frameworks to attempt to synthesize training data specifically tailored for text-based CAD tasks, thus addressing the prevalent challenge of obtaining high-quality, corresponding triplet data (original, edited, and instructions) for model training. The automated synthesis pipeline is a notable strength, as it enhances the scalability of training data generation, a key bottleneck in machine learning. Furthermore, the introduction of a locate-then-infill strategy is innovative and pragmatic. This approach allows for modular handling of the complex task of text-based editing by breaking it down into more manageable sub-tasks. By leveraging LLMs, the framework capitalizes on state-of-the-art natural language processing capabilities, demonstrating an effective intersection of CAD technology and AI. Despite these strengths, there are weaknesses to consider. The framework’s reliance on Large Language Models raises concerns regarding bias and generalizability across diverse CAD domains. Furthermore, while the experiments report superior performance, the paper may lack comprehensive comparisons with a wider array of prior methods, which could provide clearer context for the claimed improvements. Additionally, the practical applicability of this framework in real-world industrial settings may need further exploration, including user acceptance and the integration process into existing CAD systems. In conclusion, CAD-Editor introduces a promising advancement in text-based CAD editing, addressing notable gaps in the field. Given its novel approach to training data synthesis and task decomposition, the paper holds significant potential for influencing future research and applications in CAD technology. **Score: 8**

If expanded upon, it could influence the automotive industry's shift toward more automated testing processes, which could enhance safety and efficiency. However, broader implications require more exploration, especially concerning challenges of varying contexts and API types. **Score: 7**  The paper presents valuable insights and advancements in a critical field, but it falls short in exploring limitations and scalability concerns. Its contributions are significant but would benefit from a deeper analysis to enhance general applicability and address potential challenges.

To that end, we formulate classification tasks and finally show that this problem can be adequately framed as a regression task using Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) with Large Language Models (LLMs). We test Ministral-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4, finding that the latter two have reasonable agreement with humans and each other. We conclude that this approach is more cost-effective and similarly robust compared to a fine-grained multi-class approach, allowing automated quantity estimation across species.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper investigates methods for assessing species frequency using historical survey text, proposing a novel classification framework that transitions into a regression model employing Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) alongside Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors tested three models – Ministral-8B, DeepSeek-V3, and GPT-4 – and found that GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3 exhibited a strong correlation with human assessments of species frequency. The findings suggest that this methodology is more efficient and comparably robust than traditional fine-grained multi-class approaches, thereby facilitating automated species quantity estimation. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper presents a new approach to species frequency estimation by framing the challenge as a regression task utilizing LLMs and BWS, which is a novel combination in the field of biodiversity research. The application of this method, particularly with historical survey texts, offers a fresh perspective on data extraction and analysis in ecological studies. **Significance:** The implications of automating species quantity estimation are substantial, particularly for conservation efforts and ecological assessments. Given the historical data often used in biodiversity studies, the ability to efficiently and accurately quantify species presence represents a meaningful advancement. **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Innovation:** The combination of LLMs with BWS for this specific application is a significant methodological advancement. 2. **Practical Applications:** The approach promises to allow for quicker and more resource-efficient biodiversity assessments. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The empirical testing of multiple models provides a solid basis for the claims made regarding effectiveness and reliability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Models:** While GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3 showed reasonable performance, the reliance on only three models may overlook other potential candidates that could yield different results. 2. **Human Agreement Metrics:** The paper does not sufficiently elaborate on how alignment with human assessments was measured, which could raise questions about the robustness of those comparisons. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The practical scalability of this approach in large datasets or in varied ecological contexts was not thoroughly discussed. Overall, while the paper contributes innovative methods that address a relevant issue in biodiversity research, it could benefit from broader model evaluations and deeper discussions on methodological limitations.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong contribution to the intersection of natural language processing and ecological research while acknowledging the need for additional rigor in model evaluation and validation metrics. The potential for this approach to significantly influence biodiversity assessments justifies the high score.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04030v1)
- **Authors**: Guinan Su, Jonas Geiping
- **Abstract**: Reasoning capabilities represent a critical frontier for large language models (LLMs), but developing them requires extensive proprietary datasets and computational resources. One way to efficiently supplement capabilities with is by model merging, which offers a promising alternative by combining multiple models without retraining. However, current merging approaches rely on manually-designed strategies for merging hyperparameters, limiting the exploration of potential model combinations and requiring significant human effort. We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks. Effective merges are found with limited compute, e.g. within less than 500 search steps.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper proposes an Automated Model Merging Framework aimed at enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of traditional model merging techniques, which require cumbersome manual adjustments of hyperparameters. The framework allows for the fine-grained exploration of merging strategies and is designed to be cost-effective through multi-fidelity approximations. It features single and multi-objective optimization along with two novel search methodologies: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in autonomously identifying merges that enhance performance on tasks, even after fine-tuning, and optimize multi-objective outcomes. Remarkably, effective merges can be identified using limited computational resources, with fewer than 500 search steps. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Contribution:**  This paper presents a commendable advancement in the field of model merging, especially in its emphasis on automation and the introduction of novel search spaces (LFS and DIS). By reducing human effort and computational costs associated with model merging, the framework critically addresses the barriers that have previously hindered exploratory research in model combinations. Furthermore, the support for both single and multi-objective optimizations broadens its applicability and relevance in practical scenarios. **Strengths:** - The automation aspect reduces reliance on tedious manual processes, making model merging more accessible to practitioners. - The introduction of multi-fidelity approximations offers a cost-efficient alternative to computationally expensive merging strategies. - The dual consideration of performance improvement (single-objective) and the optimization of multiple objectives showcases a thoughtful extension of the research. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper demonstrates effectiveness over various benchmarks, the scope of these evaluations may not encompass all prevalent models or tasks in the field, which could limit the generalizability of the results. - The reliance on a limited number of search steps might obfuscate the potential variances in performance that could arise with extended search capabilities. The long-term efficacy of the identified merges in real-world applications remains an open question. - The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art merging techniques to delineate its advantages more clearly. **Overall Significance:** The framework’s potential to streamline model merging processes represents a significant step forward in making advanced reasoning capabilities more feasible for LLMs. Despite some limitations regarding comprehensiveness and depth of experimental validation, its contributions to automation and cost-effectiveness mark it as a worthy read for researchers and practitioners alike. **Score: 8**

### Exploring Imbalanced Annotations for Effective In-Context Learning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04037v1)
- **Authors**: Hongfu Gao, Feipeng Zhang, Hao Zeng, Deyu Meng, Bingyi Jing, Hongxin Wei
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks through in-context learning (ICL), which heavily relies on the demonstrations selected from annotated datasets. Existing selection methods may hinge on the distribution of annotated datasets, which can often be long-tailed in real-world scenarios. In this work, we show that imbalanced class distributions in annotated datasets significantly degrade the performance of ICL across various tasks and selection methods. Moreover, traditional rebalance methods fail to ameliorate the issue of class imbalance in ICL. Our method is motivated by decomposing the distributional differences between annotated and test datasets into two-component weights: class-wise weights and conditional bias. The key idea behind our method is to estimate the conditional bias by minimizing the empirical error on a balanced validation dataset and to employ the two-component weights to modify the original scoring functions during selection. Our approach can prevent selecting too many demonstrations from a single class while preserving the effectiveness of the original selection methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, improving the average accuracy by up to 5.46 on common benchmarks with imbalanced datasets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Exploring Imbalanced Annotations for Effective In-Context Learning" investigates the impact of imbalanced class distributions in annotated datasets on the performance of in-context learning (ICL) using large language models (LLMs). The authors identify that traditional selection methods for demonstrations commonly used in ICL are adversely affected by long-tailed distributions typical in many real-world datasets. They present a novel approach that decomposes the discrepancies between annotated and test datasets into two components: class-wise weights and conditional bias. The proposed method aims to address the class imbalance by estimating conditional bias via a balanced validation dataset and adjusting selection scoring functions accordingly. This strategy helps distribute selections more evenly across classes while maintaining the original methods' effectiveness. Results indicate that their method significantly enhances ICL performance, achieving an increase in average accuracy of up to 5.46 on benchmark tasks characterized by imbalanced datasets. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper presents a clear and significant contribution to the literature on ICL and the effective use of LLMs in relation to imbalanced datasets, a common yet underexplored aspect of model performance. While the issue of class imbalance is recognized in machine learning, the specific focus on its impact on ICL and the introduction of a dual-weight approach is both innovative and relevant. #### Strengths 1. **Addressing a Key Issue**: The examination of imbalanced annotations is particularly timely as it aligns with increasingly prevalent applications of LLMs, making the findings highly applicable in practice. 2. **Methodological Contribution**: The two-component weight approach is methodologically robust and offers a fresh perspective on selection techniques. The empirical results support the claims, demonstrating a measurable improvement in model accuracy. 3. **Extensive Experiments**: The paper provides comprehensive experimental validation on various common benchmarks, lending credibility to the proposed method. #### Weaknesses 1. **Generalizability**: Although the paper shows improvement on specific benchmarks, it would benefit from exploring how well the method generalizes to other unsupervised or low-resource tasks where class imbalance may differ substantially. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: Implementing the proposed adjustments might increase the complexity of selection algorithms, potentially making them less accessible for practitioners who may prefer simpler approaches. 3. **Broader Class Balance Measures**: The method focuses on two components of weight; however, there may be additional factors affecting performance related to the interactions between classes that are not addressed here. #### Impact on the Field The findings of this paper are likely to influence research focusing on ICL and class imbalance in LLMs by prompting further exploration into innovative methods for balancing training data. This could lead to more robust models capable of handling diverse datasets more effectively.  ### Final Score Considering the novelty, robustness of methodology, and potential implications on both research and practical applications, I would assign the paper a score of **8**.

### PartEdit: Fine-Grained Image Editing using Pre-Trained Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04050v1)
- **Authors**: Aleksandar Cvejic, Abdelrahman Eldesokey, Peter Wonka
- **Abstract**: We present the first text-based image editing approach for object parts based on pre-trained diffusion models. Diffusion-based image editing approaches capitalized on the deep understanding of diffusion models of image semantics to perform a variety of edits. However, existing diffusion models lack sufficient understanding of many object parts, hindering fine-grained edits requested by users. To address this, we propose to expand the knowledge of pre-trained diffusion models to allow them to understand various object parts, enabling them to perform fine-grained edits. We achieve this by learning special textual tokens that correspond to different object parts through an efficient token optimization process. These tokens are optimized to produce reliable localization masks at each inference step to localize the editing region. Leveraging these masks, we design feature-blending and adaptive thresholding strategies to execute the edits seamlessly. To evaluate our approach, we establish a benchmark and an evaluation protocol for part editing. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing editing methods on all metrics and is preferred by users 77-90% of the time in conducted user studies.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper introduces "PartEdit," a novel image editing framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion models to perform text-based editing specifically targeting object parts. Despite the advancements in image editing through diffusion models, existing approaches struggle with a comprehensive understanding of object parts, which limits their ability to execute fine-grained user edits. The authors address this by developing specialized textual tokens that correspond to distinct object parts, optimized via a token optimization process to create reliable localization masks during editing. This enables precise editing by blending features and applying adaptive thresholding strategies. The authors also establish a benchmark for evaluating part editing, demonstrating through experiments that PartEdit outperforms traditional methods across various metrics and is favored by users in a significant majority of cases. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The concept of improving diffusion models for fine-grained image editing by focusing on object parts is relatively novel. While diffusion models have been applied to various image tasks, the specific adaptation for localized object part editing presents a new avenue for research. The idea of utilizing optimized textual tokens to enhance object part understanding stands out as innovative, paving the way for more intelligent editing processes.  **Significance**: The impact of introducing PartEdit can be considerable, especially as demand for personalized and content-aware editing tools rises. By addressing the limitations of existing models in localizing and editing specific parts of images, the framework could advance applications in artificial intelligence, graphic design, and digital media. **Strengths**: 1. **Technical Contribution**: The paper provides a solid technical foundation through the optimization of textual tokens that enhance part recognition in diffusion models. 2. **Benchmarking**: Establishing a benchmark for part editing is beneficial for future research and sets a precedent for further evaluations in this domain. 3. **User Preference**: The user study results demonstrating a 77-90% preference for PartEdit lend credibility to the practical utility of the approach. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Object Parts**: While the study expands object part recognition, the range and complexity of parts may not be exhaustive, and future work may need to validate token effectiveness across diverse object types. 2. **Generalizability**: The method's performance might vary significantly with unseen or unusual images, which could limit its applicability in real-world scenarios. 3. **Complexity and Efficiency**: The additional computational overhead introduced by optimizing tokens and managing localization masks may impact efficiency, making the approach less feasible for real-time applications. **Potential Influence**: PartEdit has the potential to inspire further research into fine-grained image editing techniques and could spur developments in user-friendly editing applications that leverage AI. However, additional work is needed to enhance robustness and efficiency. **Score**: 8 **Justification**: The score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to the domain of image editing, particularly in the context of diffusion models. While it introduces novel concepts and shows promising results, concerns regarding the scope, generalizability, and efficiency temper the overall impact. Future enhancements and a broader validation will be crucial for cementing its position within the field.

### Decision Trees That Remember: Gradient-Based Learning of Recurrent Decision Trees with Memory
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04052v1)
- **Authors**: Sascha Marton, Moritz Schneider
- **Abstract**: Neural architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and State-Space Models have shown great success in handling sequential data by learning temporal dependencies. Decision Trees (DTs), on the other hand, remain a widely used class of models for structured tabular data but are typically not designed to capture sequential patterns directly. Instead, DT-based approaches for time-series data often rely on feature engineering, such as manually incorporating lag features, which can be suboptimal for capturing complex temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce ReMeDe Trees, a novel recurrent DT architecture that integrates an internal memory mechanism, similar to RNNs, to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. Our model learns hard, axis-aligned decision rules for both output generation and state updates, optimizing them efficiently via gradient descent. We provide a proof-of-concept study on synthetic benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Decision Trees That Remember: Gradient-Based Learning of Recurrent Decision Trees with Memory" addresses the challenge of utilizing decision trees (DTs) for sequential data analysis, a domain traditionally dominated by neural network architectures. The authors propose a novel structure called ReMeDe Trees that incorporates an internal memory mechanism akin to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data. This model innovatively learns decision rules that update states and generate outputs directly through gradient descent optimization, without the need for extensive feature engineering. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through synthetic benchmark tests. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its attempt to combine the strengths of traditional decision trees with recurrent architectures, creating a hybrid model that can potentially perform well on sequential data while maintaining the interpretability of decision trees. This integration is significant because traditional DTs do not inherently handle time dependencies, and the proposed ReMeDe Trees model could fill an important gap in machine learning methods for time-series analysis. However, several aspects warrant critical evaluation: 1. **Novelty and Originality**: While there is a growing trend of hybrid models that incorporate structures from both decision trees and neural networks, the specific construction and the integration of memory within DTs present a creative perspective. However, the concept of incorporating memory into decision-making algorithms is not entirely new, which tempers the originality claim. 2. **Implementation and Complexity**: The paper does not provide detailed insights into the computation and resource requirements of the proposed model compared to existing techniques. It's important to assess whether the benefits of increased performance justify the potential complexity and computational overhead of this hybrid approach. 3. **Generalization and Real-world Applicability**: The proofs based on synthetic benchmarks may not fully translate to real-world applications. The performance in diverse scenarios like missing data, noise, and various types of sequential data is critical for assessing the model's robustness. 4. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could strengthen its significance by including comparisons to existing methods beyond synthetic benchmarks. Demonstrating how ReMeDe Trees perform in practical settings against established RNNs, transformers, or other state-of-the-art models would provide valuable insights into its actual usefulness. In summary, while the paper presents an exciting blend of decision trees with memory mechanisms, which could influence future research in sequential data modeling, its novelty is slightly undermined by similar prior works, insufficient real-world validations, and limited comparative analyses. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a promising contribution with a practical approach to a relevant problem, but it also acknowledges the need for further validation and a clearer distinction from existing methodologies. The paper has the potential to influence future research, though it currently lacks robust evidence demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches.

### TQ-DiT: Efficient Time-Aware Quantization for Diffusion Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04056v1)
- **Authors**: Younghye Hwang, Hyojin Lee, Joonhyuk Kang
- **Abstract**: Diffusion transformers (DiTs) combine transformer architectures with diffusion models. However, their computational complexity imposes significant limitations on real-time applications and sustainability of AI systems. In this study, we aim to enhance the computational efficiency through model quantization, which represents the weights and activation values with lower precision. Multi-region quantization (MRQ) is introduced to address the asymmetric distribution of network values in DiT blocks by allocating two scaling parameters to sub-regions. Additionally, time-grouping quantization (TGQ) is proposed to reduce quantization error caused by temporal variation in activations. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to the original full-precision model with only a 0.29 increase in FID at W8A8. Furthermore, it outperforms other baselines at W6A6, thereby confirming its suitability for low-bit quantization. These results highlight the potential of our method to enable efficient real-time generative models.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper titled "TQ-DiT: Efficient Time-Aware Quantization for Diffusion Transformers" addresses the computational challenges associated with diffusion transformers, which combine transformer architectures and diffusion models. The authors propose an enhanced quantization technique to improve efficiency by using lower precision representations for model weights and activations. Their method includes two innovative approaches: multi-region quantization (MRQ), which applies different scaling parameters to sub-regions of asymmetrically distributed values, and time-grouping quantization (TGQ), aimed at minimizing quantization errors due to variations in temporal activations. Experimental results show that the proposed TQ-DiT achieves performance similar to a full-precision model while significantly reducing the computational requirements, especially at lower bit quantizations like W6A6. The results demonstrate the method's potential for enabling efficient real-time generative models. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper introduces two new techniques—MRQ and TGQ—that specifically target the inefficiencies of diffusion transformers. The focus on quantization methods tailored for the unique characteristics of DiTs is a notable contribution, as many existing approaches do not consider asymmetry and temporal variations inherently present in these models. This approach could have important implications for real-time applications, where computational efficiency is crucial. **Strengths:** - The paper clarifies the challenges posed by high computational complexity in diffusion transformers and directly addresses these with innovative solutions. - Experimental results are convincingly presented, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to full-precision models while permitting lower-bit quantizations. - The rigorous evaluation against existing baseline models enhances the credibility and relevance of the findings. **Weaknesses:** - While the results show promise, the increase in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of only 0.29 at W8A8 may be insufficiently explained in practical terms, considering the potential qualitative impact on generative performance. - The paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion regarding the scalability of the method and its applicability across diverse datasets or tasks beyond the tested scenarios. - The potential trade-offs between quantization levels and model interpretability remain unaddressed, which is a significant consideration in real-world applications. **Significance:** The proposed method's ability to reduce computation could influence the design of future generative models, particularly as AI systems require more efficient processing to meet the demands of real-time applications. However, the extent of its impact will depend on further validation in broader contexts and attention to issues like interpretability and model performance under various conditions. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper’s solid contributions and novel approaches to addressing significant challenges in diffusion transformers, while acknowledging the need for further exploration of its limitations and broader applications. The approach has the potential to influence ongoing research in model efficiency, thus its high impact within the field.

### Predicting Large Language Model Capabilities on Closed-Book QA Tasks Using Only Information Available Prior to Training
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04066v1)

- **Abstract**: The GPT-4 technical report from OpenAI suggests that model performance on specific tasks can be predicted prior to training, though methodologies remain unspecified. This approach is crucial for optimizing resource allocation and ensuring data alignment with target tasks. To achieve this vision, we focus on predicting performance on Closed-book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks, which are closely tied to pre-training data and knowledge retention. We address three major challenges: 1) mastering the entire pre-training process, especially data construction; 2) evaluating a model's knowledge retention; and 3) predicting task-specific knowledge retention using only information available prior to training. To tackle these challenges, we pre-train three large language models (i.e., 1.6B, 7B, and 13B) using 560k dollars and 520k GPU hours. We analyze the pre-training data with knowledge triples and assess knowledge retention using established methods. Additionally, we introduce the SMI metric, an information-theoretic measure that quantifies the relationship between pre-training data, model size, and task-specific knowledge retention. Our experiments reveal a strong linear correlation ($\text{R}^2 > 0.84$) between the SMI metric and the model's accuracy on CBQA tasks across models of varying sizes (i.e., 1.1B, 1.6B, 7B, and 13B). The dataset, model, and code are available at https://github.com/yuhui1038/SMI.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the feasibility of predicting the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Closed-Book Question Answering (CBQA) tasks prior to training, building upon insights suggested by the GPT-4 technical report. It addresses three key challenges: comprehending the pre-training process and data assembly, evaluating knowledge retention in models, and predicting how well models can retain task-specific information using pre-training metrics. The authors pre-train LLMs of varying sizes (1.6B, 7B, and 13B parameters) at significant resource costs ($560k and 520k GPU hours) and analyze their pre-training data through knowledge triples alongside the introduction of the SMI metric. This metric demonstrates a strong linear correlation with model performance, highlighted with a correlation coefficient of R² > 0.84 across models, indicating that model size and data quality significantly influence task-specific capabilities. The authors provide their models, dataset, and code via a GitHub repository. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of large language models, particularly in its innovative approach to predicting performance on specific tasks before training begins. The introduction of the SMI metric as an information-theoretic measure demonstrates a novel method of linking pre-training conditions to task outcomes, showing practical implications for resource optimization in future model training.  However, while the correlation demonstrated (R² > 0.84) is statistically significant, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of why this accumulation of knowledge as indicated by the SMI metric translates to performance metrics across diverse tasks. Furthermore, discussions around the implications of model size versus data quality in performance prediction could be expanded, especially considering that the exploration is limited to closed-book QA tasks.  Another area of concern is the potential generalizability of the findings. While providing insights for CBQA, it is unclear how broadly applicable the SMI can be to other forms of QA or even different types of NLP tasks, which may dilute its impact.  In conclusion, the work stands out for its methodological approach and the clarity of its contribution, but it leaves open questions regarding broader applicability and the underlying mechanisms at play. The unfamiliarity of some metrics, coupled with potential limitations in the scope of evaluated tasks warrants caution in overgeneralization. **Score: 7**  This score reflects solid novelty and practical significance while also addressing the need for broader generalizability and deeper analytical depth in certain areas.

- **Authors**: Qingyue Yang, Jie Wang, Xing Li, Zhihai Wang, Chen Chen, Lei Chen, Xianzhi Yu, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao, Mingxuan Yuan, Bin Li
- **Abstract**: With the development of large language models (LLMs), efficient inference through Key-Value (KV) cache compression has attracted considerable attention, especially for long-context generation. To compress the KV cache, recent methods identify critical KV tokens through heuristic ranking with attention scores. However, these methods often struggle to accurately determine critical tokens as they neglect the \textit{temporal patterns} in attention scores, resulting in a noticeable degradation in LLM performance. To address this challenge, we propose AttentionPredictor, which is the first learning-based critical token identification approach. Specifically, AttentionPredictor learns a lightweight convolution model to capture spatiotemporal patterns and predict the next-token attention score. An appealing feature of AttentionPredictor is that it accurately predicts the attention score while consuming negligible memory. Moreover, we propose a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework that hides the token estimation time overhead to accelerate the decoding stage. By retaining most of the attention information, AttentionPredictor achieves 16$\times$ KV cache compression with comparable LLM performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents AttentionPredictor, an innovative approach for improving the efficiency of Large Language Model (LLM) inference by focusing on the compression of Key-Value (KV) caches, which are critical for long-context generation. Previous methods have inadequately utilized attention scores due to their neglect of temporal patterns, leading to decreased model performance. AttentionPredictor utilizes a lightweight convolutional model to learn and predict next-token attention scores by capturing spatiotemporal patterns. This method not only retains most of the attention information but also achieves a significant 16× compression of the KV cache while maintaining performance levels comparable to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, the paper introduces a cross-token critical cache prefetching framework, optimizing the decoding stage by masking the token estimation overhead. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of the paper lies in its learning-based approach to critical token identification, which marks a departure from traditional heuristic methods that fail to account for temporal patterns in attention scores. While many existing methods prioritize immediate attention scores, AttentionPredictor's focus on spatiotemporal dynamics is a substantial advancement in the field, addressing a known limitation. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The use of a lightweight convolutional model to capture spatiotemporal patterns is a significant contribution that offers a more sophisticated understanding of attention mechanisms. 2. **High Compression Ratio**: Achieving 16× compression while maintaining performance is impressive and indicates practical applicability for resource-constrained environments. 3. **Enhanced Performance**: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, suggesting strong potential for real-world use in LLM applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: A learning-based model can be more complex to implement and tune compared to straightforward heuristic methods, which may deter some practitioners. 2. **Generalizability**: The paper may lack experimental validation across various types of LLMs or contexts, which is crucial for assessing the robustness and scalability of the proposed method outside of controlled settings. Overall, AttentionPredictor represents a meaningful advancement in the field of LLM efficiency. Its ability to improve KV cache compression without significantly impacting performance has implications for both research and practical applications in natural language generation. Score: 8. This score reflects strong novelty and significant potential impact while acknowledging some concerns regarding complexity and generalizability.

Various LLM-based techniques are employed to create the dataset, including chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting. A custom evaluation framework is developed to assess question and answer quality across multiple dimensions, including faithfulness, relevance, and domain specificity. The dataset averages a score range of 8.16 out of 10 on these metrics. (2) Two architectures for question-answering in the sustainability reporting domain - a RAG pipeline and a fully LLM-based pipeline. The architectures are developed by experimenting, fine-tuning, and training on the QA dataset. The final pipelines feature an LLM fine-tuned on domain specific data and an industry classification component to improve the handling of complex queries. The RAG architecture achieves an accuracy of 85.32% on single-industry and 72.15% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, outperforming the baseline approach by 4.67 and 19.21 percentage points, respectively. The LLM-based pipeline achieves an accuracy of 93.45% on single-industry and 80.30% on cross-industry multiple-choice questions, an improvement of 12.80 and 27.36 percentage points over the baseline, respectively.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: This paper presents a tailored approach for creating a domain-specific knowledge assistant focused on sustainability reporting under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).

Additionally, the paper introduces two distinct architectures for question-answering: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and a fully LLM-based system. These architectures have been tested and fine-tuned on the newly created dataset, with the RAG pipeline achieving accuracy rates of 85.32% and 72.15% on single-industry and cross-industry questions, respectively. The LLM-based model surpassed these figures, yielding accuracy rates of 93.45% and 80.30%, showcasing significant improvements over baseline models. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Gap**: The creation of a synthetic QA dataset focused on IFRS sustainability standards is a significant contribution, particularly in a field lacking publicly available data. This effort fills a notable gap and enables further research and development of chatbots in sustainability reporting. 2. **Robust Methodology**: The use of advanced LLM techniques like chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot prompting to generate and evaluate the dataset demonstrates innovation and methodological rigor. The custom evaluation framework for assessing QA pair quality also adds value to this work. 3. **Performance**: The results indicating high accuracy for both the RAG pipeline and the LLM-based system suggest that the authors have successfully integrated their findings into practical applications that can significantly advance the tools available for sustainability reporting. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limitations of Generalizability**: While the focus on a specific domain is initially a strength, it might also restrict the wider applicability of the findings. The developed models may not transfer easily to other domains without further adaptation and validation. 2. **Evaluation Depth**: Although the proposed dataset and models exhibit strong performance metrics, the paper may benefit from a more thorough exploration of potential biases in the dataset or a consideration of the models' performance in real-world scenarios beyond the datasets used. 3. **Lack of Broader Context**: The paper doesn't sufficiently contextualize the importance of IFRS sustainability reporting in terms of larger trends in sustainability or financial regulation, which could elevate the significance of the work. ### Score: 8 **Rationale:** The paper makes a commendable contribution to the field of sustainability reporting through the development of a synthetic QA dataset and innovative question-answering architectures. Its strengths lie in both filling a critical data gap and demonstrating effective methodologies that enhance chatbot capabilities in this domain. However, concerns regarding the generalizability of the findings and potential biases highlight areas for further investigation. Overall, while the paper exhibits significant novelty and practical impact, the limitations outlined prevent it from receiving an optimal score, thus meriting an 8.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04128v1)
- **Authors**: Zhen Ye, Xinfa Zhu, Chi-Min Chan, Xinsheng Wang, Xu Tan, Jiahe Lei, Yi Peng, Haohe Liu, Yizhu Jin, Zheqi DAI, Hongzhan Lin, Jianyi Chen, Xingjian Du, Liumeng Xue, Yunlin Chen, Zhifei Li, Lei Xie, Qiuqiang Kong, Yike Guo, Wei Xue
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in text-based large language models (LLMs), particularly in the GPT series and the o1 model, have demonstrated the effectiveness of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute. However, current state-of-the-art TTS systems leveraging LLMs are often multi-stage, requiring separate models (e.g., diffusion models after LLM), complicating the decision of whether to scale a particular model during training or testing. This work makes the following contributions: First, we explore the scaling of train-time and inference-time compute for speech synthesis. Second, we propose a simple framework Llasa for speech synthesis that employs a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture to fully align with standard LLMs such as Llama. Our experiments reveal that scaling train-time compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness of synthesized speech and enables the generation of more complex and accurate prosody patterns. Furthermore, from the perspective of scaling inference-time compute, we employ speech understanding models as verifiers during the search, finding that scaling inference-time compute shifts the sampling modes toward the preferences of specific verifiers, thereby improving emotional expressiveness, timbre consistency, and content accuracy. In addition, we released the checkpoint and training code for our TTS model (1B, 3B, 8B) and codec model publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Llasa: Scaling Train-Time and Inference-Time Compute for Llama-based Speech Synthesis" discusses improvements in text-to-speech (TTS) systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) like Llama. It addresses the complications arising from multi-stage TTS systems that require scaling decisions for training and inference separately. The authors present Llasa, a novel approach that uses a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a unified Transformer architecture, enhancing alignment with existing LLMs. Their findings demonstrate that scaling train-time compute distinctly enhances the naturalness and complexity of synthesized speech and prosody. Additionally, scaling inference-time compute, guided by speech understanding models as verifiers, facilitates improved emotional expressiveness and content accuracy. The authors have made their model and training code available for others to use and develop upon. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces a significant advancement in TTS by simplifying the architecture and effectively scaling both train-time and inference-time compute, which presents a compelling contribution to the field. The use of a single-layer VQ codec and a unified architecture streamlines the implementation, potentially lowering barriers to entry for researchers and developers exploring TTS with LLMs.  However, the method’s novelty partially hinges on the existing frameworks within the broader context of LLMs, which are gaining traction in various applications, including TTS. While the findings regarding the improvements in speech naturalness and prosody complexity are important, similar scaling experiments with LLMs have been explored before. As such, the degree of novelty could be questioned if the contributions are not significantly differentiated from prior work. Moreover, further empirical evidence and rigorous experimentation across diverse datasets could bolster the findings' robustness and generalizability. The release of open-source artifacts (checkpoints and training code) is commendable, promoting collaboration and development in the community. Still, the practical impact and usability of the proposed model will ultimately depend on how well it performs relative to other state-of-the-art systems in varied contexts. In summary, while the paper sheds light on pertinent issues within the TTS landscape and makes tangible contributions, its novelty is somewhat muted by existing research trends. The soundness of experimental results adds to its merit, though further validation and exploration will heighten its influence within the field. **Score: 7**  This score reflects both the strengths in advancing the methodologies of TTS systems while recognizing the need for a clearer differentiation from prior work and a broader empirical foundation.

### The Order Effect: Investigating Prompt Sensitivity in Closed-Source LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04134v1)
- **Authors**: Bryan Guan, Tanya Roosta, Peyman Passban, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh
- **Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become integral to diverse applications, ensuring their reliability under varying input conditions is crucial. One key issue affecting this reliability is order sensitivity, wherein slight variations in input arrangement can lead to inconsistent or biased outputs. Although recent advances have reduced this sensitivity, the problem remains unresolved. This paper investigates the extent of order sensitivity in closed-source LLMs by conducting experiments across multiple tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgment, and multiple-choice questions. Our results show that input order significantly affects performance across tasks, with shuffled inputs leading to measurable declines in output accuracy. Few-shot prompting demonstrates mixed effectiveness and offers partial mitigation, however, fails to fully resolve the problem. These findings highlight persistent risks, particularly in high-stakes applications, and point to the need for more robust LLMs or improved input-handling techniques in future development.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "The Order Effect: Investigating Prompt Sensitivity in Closed-Source LLMs" addresses a critical issue in the reliability of large language models (LLMs) — order sensitivity, which refers to the way that slight variations in the input arrangement can significantly impact the output generated by these models. Through a series of experiments on various tasks, including paraphrasing, relevance judgments, and multiple-choice questions, the authors demonstrate that the input order has a measurable effect on performance, with inaccuracies occurring when input is shuffled. While the study explores the effectiveness of few-shot prompting as a potential mitigation strategy, it concludes that this approach is insufficient to entirely counter the order sensitivity issue. The findings underscore the persistent challenges faced by LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications, indicating a pressing need for improved robustness or better handling of inputs in future LLM development. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of this paper lies in its focused investigation of order sensitivity in closed-source LLMs, a topic that is somewhat overlooked in contemporary research. While order effects in various forms of data inputs have been discussed in the literature, the specific context of LLMs, especially closed-source models, adds a fresh dimension to our understanding of their reliability and performance. The empirical evidence provided in the paper is compelling, as it draws attention to a critical limitation of these models that could affect their practical applications. The significance of the paper is further amplified by its potential implications for the design and deployment of LLMs. As these models are increasingly used in scenarios where precision and reliability are paramount, such as healthcare and legal domains, the findings highlight a significant risk that practitioners might overlook. The call for further research and development directed at addressing order sensitivity is timely and necessary, making this paper a valuable contribution to the field. However, the paper does have limitations. The experiments are primarily conducted on a limited number of tasks, which might not comprehensively represent the breadth of LLM applications or the diversity of input types. Additionally, while the authors suggest improvements in input-handling techniques, they do not provide concrete proposals or frameworks, which could enhance the practical applicability of their findings. In summary, the paper presents significant findings that contribute to the growing discourse on LLM reliability and offer a critical avenue for further research. Nevertheless, the limitations in scope and practical recommendations slightly hinder its overall impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, with notable novelty and implications, but acknowledges that there could be deeper explorations and more actionable insights provided by the authors.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04153v1)
- **Authors**: Kaikai An, Li Sheng, Ganqu Cui, Shuzheng Si, Ning Ding, Yu Cheng, Baobao Chang
- **Abstract**: Instruction-following made modern large language models (LLMs) helpful assistants. However, the key to taming LLMs on complex instructions remains mysterious, for that there are huge gaps between models trained by open-source community and those trained by leading companies. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple and scalable approach UltraIF for building LLMs that can follow complex instructions with open-source data. UltraIF first decomposes real-world user prompts into simpler queries, constraints, and corresponding evaluation questions for the constraints. Then, we train an UltraComposer to compose constraint-associated prompts with evaluation questions. This prompt composer allows us to synthesize complicated instructions as well as filter responses with evaluation questions. In our experiment, for the first time, we successfully align LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to catch up with its instruct version on 5 instruction-following benchmarks without any benchmark information, using only 8B model as response generator and evaluator. The aligned model also achieved competitive scores on other benchmarks. Moreover, we also show that UltraIF could further improve LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment, motivating broader use cases for the method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/kkk-an/UltraIF.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "UltraIF: Advancing Instruction Following from the Wild" introduces a novel approach called UltraIF designed to improve the ability of large language models (LLMs) to execute complex instructions utilizing open-source data. The authors identify a gap between the performance of LLMs trained by the open-source community compared to those from leading companies, particularly in instruction-following tasks. UltraIF addresses this by breaking down real-world user prompts into simpler components such as queries and evaluation questions. This framework includes the training of an UltraComposer, which facilitates the synthesis of complex instructions and the filtering of generated responses through evaluations. The authors demonstrate that their method enables LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base to meet the performance of its instruct variant across five benchmarks without prior knowledge of those benchmarks. Additionally, the method's ability to further refine LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct through self-alignment suggests promising implications for broader applications. The related code will be available on GitHub. **Rigorous Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution**: UltraIF presents a clear and structured method to enhance instruction-following capabilities using open-source LLMs, which addresses a pressing need in the field. The approach of decomposing complex instructions into simpler, manageable components is not radically new but is an innovative application within the LLM context. The effective synthesis of complex prompts by the UltraComposer is a noteworthy feature that adds to the existing body of work.  **Strengths**: 1. **Practical Relevance**: The method effectively narrows the performance gap between well-resourced and open-source LLMs, which is critical for real-world applications. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The authors provide strong empirical results demonstrating that their approach helps LLaMA-3.1-8B-Base reach instruct model performance, which increases the credibility of their claims. 3. **Self-Alignment**: The technique of self-alignment to improve existing instruct models is a valuable addition to the field and indicates potential for further exploration. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper tackles the instruction-following tasks, it may not address other dimensions of LLM performance, such as conversational context or ethical considerations, which are paramount in deployment scenarios. 2. **Generalization**: It's unclear how well UltraIF's methods would generalize across various datasets outside those tested since the authors mention only five specific benchmarks. 3. **Absence of Comparison**: Although the results show alignment with instruct versions, they could benefit from more extensive comparisons with other contemporary methods from leading companies to better contextualize their advancements. **Potential Influence**: The techniques proposed could lead to significant improvements in the usability of open-source LLMs, further democratizing access to advanced AI systems. However, its impact will depend on subsequent validation across broader contexts and datasets. Based on the analysis, the paper earns a score reflecting its innovative methodological contributions, practical implications, and empirical validations, balanced against its limitations regarding generalization and comparability.  **Score: 7**

### Fast In-Spectrum Graph Watermarks
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04182v1)
- **Authors**: Jade Garcia Bourrée, Anne-Marie Kermarrec, Erwan Le Merrer, Othmane Safsafi
- **Abstract**: We address the problem of watermarking graph objects, which consists in hiding information within them, to prove their origin. The two existing methods to watermark graphs use subgraph matching or graph isomorphism techniques, which are known to be intractable for large graphs. To reduce the operational complexity, we propose FFG, a new graph watermarking scheme adapted from an image watermarking scheme, since graphs and images can be represented as matrices. We analyze and compare FFG, whose novelty lies in embedding the watermark in the Fourier transform of the adjacency matrix of a graph. Our technique enjoys a much lower complexity than that of related works (i.e. in $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2 \log N\right)$), while performing better or at least as well as the two state-of-the-art methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Fast In-Spectrum Graph Watermarks" addresses the challenge of watermarking graph structures to authenticate their origin, improving upon previous methods that relied on subgraph matching and graph isomorphism, which are computationally intensive for large graphs. The authors introduce a novel watermarking scheme, FFG, inspired by image watermarking techniques and based on the Fourier transform of a graph's adjacency matrix. This approach significantly reduces operational complexity to $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2 \log N\right)$ while achieving performance levels comparable to or better than the leading existing methodologies. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the domain of graph watermarking by leveraging concepts from image processing, which is a fresh perspective in this field. The reduction in computational effort is a critical advancement, as it addresses a significant bottleneck in applying watermarking techniques on large graphs, which are increasingly relevant in various applications such as social networks, molecular biology, and data security. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The approach of using Fourier transforms to embed watermarks marks an innovative departure from traditional graph authentication methods. This could open avenues for further research. 2. **Complexity Reduction:** The complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(N^2 \log N\right)$ is an attractive feature, particularly for practitioners who require efficient processing in real-world applications. 3. **Performance:** The claim that FFG performs as well or better than state-of-the-art techniques adds credibility to the proposed method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis:** While the authors claim that FFG outperforms existing methods, the details of the comparative analysis could have been presented with more depth. It would be beneficial to see stronger experimental results with varied graph sizes and structures to substantiate claims of superiority. 2. **Generalizability:** The paper does not fully explore the potential limitations of FFG in highly dynamic or complex graph scenarios, which could temper its applicability in certain fields. 3. **Experimental Validation:** The results, while promising, require comprehensive benchmarks against a broader array of existing techniques and scenarios to firmly establish its efficacy. Ultimately, despite the identified weaknesses, the novel approach and significant performance improvements suggest that this paper has the potential to influence future research in graph watermarking and related fields. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a solid contribution with considerable promise, tempered by the need for stronger empirical validation and comparative analysis to fully establish its significance within the evolving landscape of graph watermarking.

### Automated Microservice Pattern Instance Detection Using Infrastructure-as-Code Artifacts and Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04188v1)
- **Authors**: Carlos Eduardo Duarte
- **Abstract**: Documenting software architecture is essential to preserve architecture knowledge, even though it is frequently costly. Architecture pattern instances, including microservice pattern instances, provide important structural software information. Practitioners should document this information to prevent knowledge vaporization. However, architecture patterns may not be detectable by analyzing source code artifacts, requiring the analysis of other types of artifacts. Moreover, many existing pattern detection instance approaches are complex to extend. This article presents our ongoing PhD research, early experiments, and a prototype for a tool we call MicroPAD for automating the detection of microservice pattern instances. The prototype uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts to aid detection, aiming to keep costs low and maximize the scope of detectable patterns. Early experiments ran the prototype thrice in 22 GitHub projects. We verified that 83\% of the patterns that the prototype identified were in the project. The costs of detecting the pattern instances were minimal. These results indicate that the approach is likely viable and, by lowering the entry barrier to automating pattern instance detection, could help democratize developer access to this category of architecture knowledge. Finally, we present our overall research methodology, planned future work, and an overview of MicroPAD's potential industrial impact.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper discusses the importance of documenting software architecture to preserve architectural knowledge and prevent knowledge loss, particularly concerning microservice pattern instances. The challenges in detecting these patterns using traditional source code analysis, which often necessitate examining Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) artifacts, are identified. The authors present MicroPAD, a prototype tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the identification of microservice pattern instances with minimal costs. Initial experiments involving 22 GitHub projects showed promising results: 83% of the identified patterns were validated as present in the respective projects, demonstrating the potential of this approach to facilitate accessibility and democratize architectural knowledge among developers. The paper outlines the research methodology, future work, and anticipated industrial impact. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the detection of microservice pattern instances by analyzing Infrastructure-as-Code artifacts is a novel contribution to the automated software analysis domain. Most existing approaches focus solely on source code and overlook the growing significance of IaC in modern software development. By combining LLMs with IaC for architecture pattern detection, the paper presents a fresh perspective on improving software documentation processes. #### Significance: The significance of this research lies in addressing the prevalent issue of knowledge vaporization in software architecture. By providing automated tools like MicroPAD, the authors propose a way to enhance documentation practices while reducing associated costs. This is particularly relevant as organizations increasingly adopt microservice architectures, which often complicate traditional documentation methods. #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of LLMs with IaC artifacts for microservice pattern detection is an advancement over conventional methods. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: The initial experiments provide preliminary validation of the tool's effectiveness, showing a high accuracy rate (83%) in pattern identification. 3. **Low Cost**: Emphasizing the low cost of detection fosters a more inclusive environment for developers to engage with architectural documentation. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Experimentation**: While the preliminary results are promising, the sample size (22 GitHub projects) is relatively small, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Complexity of Patterns**: The diversity and complexity of microservice patterns are not fully explored, and the paper does not address how MicroPAD handles variations in implementation across different projects. 3. **Future Work Outlined**: While future research directions are noted, more specificity regarding the planned enhancements and potential challenges could strengthen the paper. #### Potential Influence: This contribution could significantly impact the software engineering field by enhancing how architectural knowledge is captured and analyzed, promoting better practices in the documentation of modern coding paradigms. If MicroPAD proves effective in wider applications, it could transform architectural documentation efforts, making it easier for organizations to maintain structural integrity and shared understanding. ### Conclusion Taking into account the novelty of applying LLMs to analyze IaC for microservice pattern detection, the practical implications of facilitating better architectural documentation, and the promising preliminary results, I assign this paper a score of **8**. This score reflects its substantial contribution while acknowledging the need for further validation and the potential complexity of the subject matter. **Score: 8**

### PixFoundation: Are We Heading in the Right Direction with Pixel-level Vision Foundation Models?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04192v1)
- **Authors**: Mennatullah Siam
- **Abstract**: Multiple works have emerged to push the boundaries on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) towards pixel-level understanding. Such approaches have shown strong performance on benchmarks for referring expression segmentation and grounded conversation generation. The current trend in pixel-level MLLMs is to train with pixel-level grounding supervision on large-scale labelled data. However, we show that such MLLMs when evaluated on recent challenging vision centric benchmarks, exhibit a weak ability in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some of these methods even downgrade the grounding ability of MLLMs that were never trained with such supervision. In this work, we propose two novel challenging benchmarks and show that MLLMs without pixel-level grounding supervision can outperform the state of the art in such tasks when evaluating both the pixel-level grounding and visual question answering. We propose simple baselines to extract the grounding information that can be plugged into any MLLM, which we call as PixFoundation. More importantly, we study the research question of ``When does grounding emerge in MLLMs that are not trained with pixel-level grounding supervision?'' We show that grounding can coincide with object parts or location/appearance information. Code repository is at https://github.com/MSiam/PixFoundation/.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "PixFoundation" investigates the efficacy of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that are trained with pixel-level grounding supervision, particularly in the context of visual question answering and grounding tasks. The authors highlight issues with existing pixel-level MLLMs, noting their limited performance on certain challenging benchmarks, specifically in visual question answering. Surprisingly, some models trained without pixel-level supervision perform better on these tasks. This paper introduces two new benchmarks to evaluate these capabilities and presents simple baselines to extract grounding information usable in any MLLM, termed PixFoundation. Additionally, they explore when grounding emerges in MLLMs devoid of pixel-level supervision, finding that grounding can manifest through understanding object parts or attributes. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant critique of the contemporary trend in training pixel-level MLLMs, questioning the assumption that pixel-level supervision is crucial for performance in vision-related tasks. This is a noteworthy contribution, as it challenges prevailing methodologies and suggests alternative approaches that may simplify or enhance model development. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Insights:** The identification of scenarios where MLLMs can outperform those trained with pixel-level supervision is innovative and prompts further questioning of common techniques in the field. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The paper provides empirical results that consolidate its claims, which adds credibility to the argument. 3. **Benchmark Contribution:** By proposing new benchmarks, the authors contribute to a valuable resource that might guide future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the benchmarks put forth may illuminate certain aspects of grounding, the paper may benefit from broader comparisons across various model architectures or larger datasets to ensure the robustness of the results. 2. **Lack of Deep Theoretical Explanation:** The findings on when grounding emerges are somewhat superficial; a deeper theoretical exploration of the underlying mechanisms governing these observations could enhance the paper's impact. Overall, while the paper is impactful for questioning the reliance on pixel-level grounding and introduces valuable benchmarks and baselines, its conclusions could benefit from further validation and deeper analysis. Given these strengths and weaknesses, I would assign a score of **7**.  **Score: 7**

### The Best Instruction-Tuning Data are Those That Fit
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04194v1)
- **Authors**: Dylan Zhang, Qirun Dai, Hao Peng
- **Abstract**: High-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data are crucial for eliciting strong capabilities from pretrained large language models (LLMs). Typically, instructions are paired with multiple responses sampled from other LLMs, which are often out of the distribution of the target model to be fine-tuned. This, at scale, can lead to diminishing returns and even hurt the models' performance and robustness. We propose **GRAPE**, a novel SFT framework that accounts for the unique characteristics of the target model. For each instruction, it gathers responses from various LLMs and selects the one with the highest probability measured by the target model, indicating that it aligns most closely with the target model's pretrained distribution; it then proceeds with standard SFT training. We first evaluate GRAPE with a controlled experiment, where we sample various solutions for each question in UltraInteract from multiple models and fine-tune commonly used LMs like LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B on GRAPE-selected data. GRAPE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including distilling from the strongest model with an absolute gain of up to 13.8%, averaged across benchmarks, and training on 3x more data with a maximum performance improvement of 17.3%. GRAPE's strong performance generalizes to realistic settings. We experiment with the post-training data used for Tulu3 and Olmo-2. GRAPE outperforms strong baselines trained on 4.5 times more data by 6.1% and a state-of-the-art data selection approach by 3% on average performance. Remarkably, using 1/3 of the data and half the number of epochs, GRAPE enables LLaMA3.1-8B to surpass the performance of Tulu3-SFT by 3.5%.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "The Best Instruction-Tuning Data are Those That Fit" introduces a novel supervised fine-tuning (SFT) framework called **GRAPE**. The authors contend that high-quality SFT data are vital for enhancing the performance of pretrained large language models (LLMs). In traditional methods, instructions are coupled with responses from various LLMs, which can often misalign with the target model's distribution, resulting in performance degradation. GRAPE addresses this issue by selecting the response to each instruction that has the highest probability according to the target model, ensuring alignment with its pretrained characteristics. This method was evaluated through controlled experiments, where GRAPE demonstrated substantial performance gains over established baselines when fine-tuning various models, achieving up to 17.3% improvement with reduced data and training epochs compared to existing methods. The results suggest that GRAPE not only improves fine-tuning efficiency but also enhances the end model's robustness and performance across realistic data settings. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper presents a noteworthy advancement in the area of instruction-tuning for LLMs. The core idea of utilizing responses aligned with the target model's distribution is innovative and directly addresses a prevalent issue in current practices. By contrast to existing strategies that often overlook such considerations, the approach proposed within GRAPE could significantly change the way SFT data is curated. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** GRAPE's mechanism of leveraging the target model's probability for response selection shows a thoughtful adaptation to the needs of SFT. 2. **Performance Gains:** The empirical results showing substantial improvements across several models lend strong support to the method's effectiveness. The performance metrics indicate that GRAPE can significantly outperform established baselines, emphasizing its practical benefits. 3. **Robustness Across Models:** The paper demonstrates that the improvements generalize to various LLMs, which reinforces the versatility of the approach and suggests broader applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Scope:** While the results are promising, the experiments mainly focus on a few commonly used models. A wider range of models and tasks could strengthen the claims regarding the generalizability and robustness of GRAPE. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper claims substantial performance gains, a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art data selection techniques beyond the immediate competitors would provide a clearer picture of GRAPE’s position in the existing landscape. 3. **Reproducibility:** As with any complex framework, details on the implementation of GRAPE should be well documented to ensure that other researchers can reproduce the findings without ambiguity. **Potential Influence:** GRAPE has the potential to influence future research in instruction-tuning by advocating for a structured approach to data selection that emphasizes alignment with model distributions. Its insights may catalyze further investigation into customized fine-tuning practices, thus shaping exploration within the LLM community. ### Conclusion In light of the presented strengths and weaknesses, the paper represents a solid contribution to the field of LLM fine-tuning, with a promising new methodology that could enhance practical applications significantly. While it is not without its limitations, the novel approach and tangible performance improvements warrant a favorable evaluation. **Score: 8**

### "Short-length" Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend "Long-length" Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04204v1)
- **Authors**: Shaopeng Fu, Liang Ding, Di Wang
- **Abstract**: Jailbreak attacks against large language models (LLMs) aim to induce harmful behaviors in LLMs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. To mitigate attacks, one way is to perform adversarial training (AT)-based alignment, i.e., training LLMs on some of the most adversarial prompts to help them learn how to behave safely under attacks. During AT, the length of adversarial prompts plays a critical role in the robustness of aligned LLMs. This paper focuses on adversarial suffix jailbreak attacks and unveils that to defend against a jailbreak attack with an adversarial suffix of length $\Theta(M)$, it is enough to align LLMs on prompts with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$. Theoretically, we analyze the adversarial in-context learning of linear transformers on linear regression tasks and prove a robust generalization bound for trained transformers. The bound depends on the term $\Theta(\sqrt{M_{\text{test}}}/M_{\text{train}})$, where $M_{\text{train}}$ and $M_{\text{test}}$ are the number of adversarially perturbed in-context samples during training and testing. Empirically, we conduct AT on popular open-source LLMs and evaluate their robustness against jailbreak attacks of different adversarial suffix lengths. Results confirm a positive correlation between the attack success rate and the ratio of the square root of the adversarial suffix during jailbreaking to the length during AT. Our findings show that it is practical to defend "long-length" jailbreak attacks via efficient "short-length" AT. The code is available at https://github.com/fshp971/adv-icl.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Short-length Adversarial Training Helps LLMs Defend 'Long-length' Jailbreak Attacks: Theoretical and Empirical Evidence" investigates methodologies to enhance the resilience of large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks, where adversarial prompts are used to make models produce harmful outputs. The authors propose a novel approach where training on shorter adversarial prompts can effectively prepare LLMs to withstand longer adversarial suffix attacks. Theoretical analysis shows that for a sophisticated jailbreak with an adversarial length of $\Theta(M)$, training with adversarial suffixes of length $\Theta(\sqrt{M})$ is sufficient for robust performance. The authors establish a generalization bound linking training and testing sample sizes to the effectiveness of the adversarial training (AT). Empirical results corroborate the theoretical claims, demonstrating that models trained with brief prompts exhibit a significant reduction in vulnerability to extensive jailbreak exploits. They emphasize the practicality of this strategy, providing code to facilitate further research. ### Critical Evaluation The paper presents valuable contributions both theoretically and empirically, making it noteworthy within the field of LLM security.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The identification that shorter adversarial trainings can defend against longer attacks introduces a scalable solution to a prevalent issue in LLM safety. This could have practical implications, expanding the avenues for secure AI deployment. 2. **Theoretical Contribution**: Establishing a generalization bound for the adversarial training process is a solid theoretical contribution that provides a framework for understanding the relationship between training and testing in adversarial contexts. 3. **Empirical Evidence**: The experiments conducted on widely-used LLMs and their systematic evaluation against varying lengths of adversarial inputs lend credibility to their claims and offer insights into real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Attack Types**: While focusing on suffix attacks is interesting, the reliance on a single type of adversarial prompt may limit the generalizability of the findings. Other modes of prompt manipulation could yield different results. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: The theoretical and empirical analyses could be expanded further to explore parameters affecting the training effectiveness and investigate longer adversarial attacks more comprehensively. 3. **Lack of Discussion on Trade-offs**: The practical implications of adopting short-length adversarial training require more scrutiny regarding potential trade-offs in model performance or accuracy on non-adversarial tasks. In terms of impact, the findings could stimulate further research into efficient adversarial training methods, potentially leading to the development of more resilient AI systems. Nonetheless, the paper’s somewhat narrow focus and lack of broader exploratory discussions warrants a moderate score. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper’s substantive contributions to the field—solving a significant problem with a compelling method and solid backing. It is positioned well for influence but could benefit from a broader scope and deeper analysis to fully realize its potential within the discourse on AI safety and performance.

We build on and generalize the known connection between learning and compression to a setting where causal models are not identifiable. We propose a framework where causality emerges as a consequence of compressing data across multiple environments. We define algorithmic causality as an alternative definition of causality when traditional assumptions for causal identifiability do not hold. We demonstrate how algorithmic causal and symmetric structures can emerge from minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, without knowledge of intervention targets. We hypothesize that these insights may also provide a novel perspective on the emergence of causality in machine learning models, such as large language models, where causal relationships may not be explicitly identifiable.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the interplay between causality, symmetry, and compression, proposing a framework where causality arises from compressing data across various environments, particularly when traditional causal models are unidentifiable. It introduces the concept of algorithmic causality, allowing for a broader understanding of causal relationships without relying on established identifiability assumptions. The authors demonstrate that algorithmic causal structures can emerge by minimizing upper bounds on Kolmogorov complexity, even in the absence of intervention targets. This work hints at new insights into the nature of causality in machine learning contexts, especially regarding large language models, where recognizing causal relationships can be challenging. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper presents an intriguing concept by merging algorithmic information theory with causality, which is relatively novel in the landscape of causal inference literature. The idea of deriving causal structures without fixed identifiability assumptions using compression techniques adds a fresh perspective, opening avenues for further research in ambiguous causal scenarios. The exploration of emergent causal structures from data compression across diverse environments is relatively unexplored and introduces theoretical richness. **Significance:** While the paper proposes an innovative framework, its practical implications for real-world applications and existing machine learning paradigms may require further elucidation and empirical validation. The approach has the potential to influence future research in causal inference, specifically in domains where interventions are hard to determine. However, the lack of specific applications or case studies demonstrating the framework's utility in real-world scenarios may limit its immediate impact. **Strengths:** - The theoretical foundation blends ideas from algorithmic information theory with causal inference, enhancing interdisciplinary understanding. - The introduction of algorithmic causality presents a useful alternative perspective when traditional methods fail. - The implications for machine learning suggest a direction that could benefit model interpretability. **Weaknesses:** - The paper does not provide empirical validations of the proposed concepts or demonstrate how effectively the framework can be applied in practical scenarios. - The discussion on large language models is somewhat superficial, lacking concrete examples or results that link the theoretical aspects to observable behavior in these systems. Overall, while the framework introduced is provocative and situates itself well within ongoing discourse in both causality and machine learning, its implications remain largely theoretical at this stage. For these reasons, the paper's contributions are commendable, yet there are considerable areas for expansion and empirical demonstration. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Laura Biester
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be biased in prior work, as they generate text that is in line with stereotypical views of the world or that is not representative of the viewpoints and values of historically marginalized demographic groups. In this work, we propose using data from parallel men's and women's events at the Olympic Games to investigate different forms of gender bias in language models. We define three metrics to measure bias, and find that models are consistently biased against women when the gender is ambiguous in the prompt. In this case, the model frequently retrieves only the results of the men's event with or without acknowledging them as such, revealing pervasive gender bias in LLMs in the context of athletics.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Sports and Women's Sports: Gender Bias in Text Generation with Olympic Data" investigates gender bias present in Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing data from both men's and women's Olympic events. It identifies a significant bias against women especially in scenarios where gender is ambiguous in the input prompts, leading models to predominantly reference men's events. To quantify this bias, the authors introduce three metrics to measure gender bias in the generated text. Their findings reveal that in instances where the input does not specify gender, models disregard women's achievements, illustrating a broader tendency for LLMs to reflect and perpetuate societal stereotypes regarding gender in sports. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Timely Topic**: The focus on gender bias within LLMs, particularly in the context of sports, is both relevant and significant given ongoing discussions about equity in various fields, including AI and athletics.  2. **Empirical Data**: Utilizing Olympic data provides a rich and well-defined context for analyzing gender bias, likely making the findings more tangible and impactful. 3. **Rigorous Metrics**: The introduction of specific metrics for measuring bias is a noteworthy contribution, as it helps to quantify a phenomenon that is often qualitatively discussed. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Analysis**: While the investigation centers on sports, it may benefit from broader comparisons across different contexts or domains to enhance generalizability. Bias may manifest differently in other areas, and an extended comparison could enrich the discourse on bias in NLP. 2. **Limited Depth in Mitigation Discussion**: The paper appears to primarily diagnose the problem without thoroughly addressing potential strategies for mitigating discovered biases in LLMs. A more balanced approach might strengthen its impact by offering actionable insights alongside the findings. 3. **Potential Overemphasis on LLMs**: While LLMs are pivotal in modern AI applications, the paper could downplay the role and influence of training data and the societal context from which these biases emerge. **Overall Impact**: This paper highlights a critical issue surrounding gender bias in artificial intelligence, encouraging further scrutiny and prompting shifts towards more equitable AI practices. Its focus on a specific domain (sports) elucidates how biases manifest differently depending on context, adding to ongoing discussions around fairness and representation in AI systems. **Score**: 7 **Rationale**: While the topic is significant and the methodological approach is sound, the paper's scope may limit its broader applicability within the field of AI research. The novelty lies in the specific use of Olympic data and the introduction of metrics, yet the lack of comprehensive discussions on mitigation and a broader contextual framework weakens its overall impact. A score of 7 reflects its valuable contributions while highlighting areas for improvement for future research.
