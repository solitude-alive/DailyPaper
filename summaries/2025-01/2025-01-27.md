- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly broadened the possibilities for editing images of real-world objects. However, performing non-rigid transformations, such as changing the pose of objects or image-based conditioning, remains challenging. Maintaining object identity during these edits is difficult, and current methods often fall short of the precision needed for industrial applications, where consistency is critical. Additionally, fine-tuning diffusion models requires custom training data, which is not always accessible in real-world scenarios. This work introduces FashionRepose, a training-free pipeline for non-rigid pose editing specifically designed for the fashion industry. The approach integrates off-the-shelf models to adjust poses of long-sleeve garments, maintaining identity and branding attributes. FashionRepose uses a zero-shot approach to perform these edits in near real-time, eliminating the need for specialized training. consistent image editing. The solution holds potential for applications in the fashion industry and other fields demanding identity preservation in image editing.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents FashionRepose, a novel, training-free pipeline designed for non-rigid pose editing of fashion garments. It addresses the limitations of current diffusion models that struggle with maintaining object identity during transformations, particularly within the fashion industry where precision and consistency are essential. By integrating readily available models, FashionRepose enables adjustments to the poses of long-sleeve garments without the need for specialized training data. This zero-shot approach allows for near real-time edits, preserving identity and branding attributes of the garments. The authors highlight the system's potential applications not only in fashion but also in other areas requiring reliable image editing. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The concept of a training-free approach to pose editing is noteworthy. The existing methodologies predominantly rely on custom training, which poses challenges in terms of resource availability and ease of implementation. FashionRepose distinguishes itself by enabling users to apply pose adjustments without the lengthy training processes typically required. However, the exclusiveness of the contribution may be somewhat diminished since the paper builds on already available diffusion models. **Significance**: The significance of the paper in the fashion industry is considerable, given the industry's reliance on visual media and the frequent requirement for pose adjustments to maintain marketing and branding consistency. The immediacy and accessibility offered by the pipeline can potentially transform workflows for fashion designers and marketers. Nonetheless, the focus on long-sleeve garments may limit its applicability to a broader spectrum of clothing types and styles. **Strengths**: - The training-free nature of the approach is a major strength, providing practical utility for users lacking the resources for extensive model training. - The integration of off-the-shelf models adds versatility and ease of implementation. - The near real-time editing capability is a significant advantage for industries operating under tight deadlines. **Weaknesses**: - The application limited to long-sleeve garments raises questions about the adaptability of the pipeline for various clothing types. - The reliance on existing diffusion models may limit innovation, as the method doesn't fundamentally alter the base processes but rather uses them creatively. - The paper may benefit from empirical evidence demonstrating the precision and effectiveness of the method across diverse scenarios and garment types. **Potential Influence**: Given the trajectory of AI in fashion, FashionRepose has the potential to influence both academic research and practical applications in the industry. If successful, it may spark further research into training-free methods and perhaps inspire enhancements to pose editing within other domains. In conclusion, while the paper presents a meaningful contribution with practical implications, its relatively narrow focus on garment type and reliance on pre-existing models limits its novelty and broader applicability.

- **Authors**: Linghao Zhang, Junhao Wang, Shilin He, Chaoyun Zhang, Yu Kang, Bowen Li, Jiaheng Wen, Chengxing Xie, Maoquan Wang, Yufan Huang, Elsie Nallipogu, Qingwei Lin, Yingnong Dang, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models have advanced automated software development, however, it remains a challenge to correctly infer dependencies, namely, identifying the internal components and external packages required for a repository to successfully run. Existing studies highlight that dependency-related issues cause over 40\% of observed runtime errors on the generated repository. To address this, we introduce DI-BENCH, a large-scale benchmark and evaluation framework specifically designed to assess LLMs' capability on dependency inference. The benchmark features 581 repositories with testing environments across Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript. Extensive experiments with textual and execution-based metrics reveal that the current best-performing model achieves only a 42.9% execution pass rate, indicating significant room for improvement. DI-BENCH establishes a new viewpoint for evaluating LLM performance on repositories, paving the way for more robust end-to-end software synthesis.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DI-BENCH: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Dependency Inference with Testable Repositories at Scale" introduces a benchmark framework specifically targeting the dependency inference capability of large language models (LLMs) in automated software development. It highlights the critical issue that over 40% of runtime errors in generated software repositories stem from dependency mismanagement. DI-BENCH includes 581 repositories across languages such as Python, C#, Rust, and JavaScript, providing both textual and execution-based metrics for evaluation. Experimental results indicate the leading model only achieves a 42.9% execution pass rate, pointing to considerable room for improvement in LLMs’ performance on this crucial aspect of software synthesis. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its establishment of a targeted benchmark (DI-BENCH) for dependency inference, an area that has significant implications for the reliability of software generated by LLMs. By addressing a specific and critical aspect of automated software development, the authors contribute to understanding and potentially mitigating a prevalent issue—runtime errors due to dependency failures. The systematic approach to compile a diverse set of repositories for testing further enhances the framework's applicability and relevance. One of the notable strengths of this paper is its empirical foundation, as it provides both quantitative data and the clear indication that existing models have substantial limitations in this domain, further justifying the need for continued research and development. Moreover, the cross-language approach could foster broader applicability of their findings and methodologies. However, there are weaknesses to consider. The paper does not delve deeply into the methodologies behind the LLMs’ dependency inference capabilities; it primarily focuses on their performance metrics. While the benchmark is a valuable step forward, it could benefit from a discussion of how individual model architectures or training data influence performance in this context. Furthermore, the reported pass rate of 42.9% indicates that the benchmark and existing models are still far from meeting software development needs, thereby questioning the immediacy of its impact on real-world applications. In summary, DI-BENCH is a significant contribution that provides a structured evaluation platform but suggests that the field still has considerable progress to make. Its introduction will likely influence future research agendas focused on improving LLMs for real-world software synthesis tasks. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's relevant innovation in benchmarking LLMs for a critical aspect of software development while recognizing the need for deeper insights into model performance and methodologies. The connection to real-world software issues enhances its significance, but the limitations noted indicate that it is a foundational contribution to an ongoing challenge rather than a sweeping solution.

### A Mutual Information Perspective on Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models for Positive View Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13718v1)
- **Authors**: Dario Serez, Marco Cristani, Alessio Del Bue, Vittorio Murino, Pietro Morerio
- **Abstract**: In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics and latent variable utilization remain only empirically observed. In this work, we propose a novel framework to systematically quantify the impact of each latent variable in MLVGMs, using Mutual Information (MI) as a guiding metric. Our analysis reveals underutilized variables and can guide the use of MLVGMs in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, and guided by the previous analysis, we apply tailored latent perturbations to produce diverse views for SSCRL, without relying on real data altogether. Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data. This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper presents a novel framework that utilizes Mutual Information (MI) to analyze the impact of latent variables in Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs). It addresses the empirical understanding of MLVGMs by systematically quantifying the contribution of each latent variable to the generative process. Recognizing underutilized variables, the study proposes a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL) that leverages the structured latent space of MLVGMs. Additionally, a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy is introduced, allowing dynamic sample generation during SSCRL training, which enhances data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that the generated views can match or even exceed the quality of those derived from real data, contributing significantly to generative modeling and self-supervised learning frameworks. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes several noteworthy contributions that enhance the understanding and application of MLVGMs, particularly in their intersection with self-supervised learning. The framing of mutual information as a metric for evaluating latent variables is both innovative and beneficial for guiding future research and applications of MLVGMs. By exposing underutilized variables, the authors provide a new management strategy for improving the generative capability of these models, which can have strong implications in various domains. However, while the approach is systematic and potentially influential, there are some limitations. The novelty lies in the application of MI to latent variable evaluation, but the core idea of varying latent perturbations is not entirely new to the field. Additionally, the experiments, while they demonstrate efficacy, could benefit from more extensive comparative benchmarks against other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, further detail on how the framework can be generalized across different MLVGMs would strengthen its impact. In terms of significance, this work presents a solid advance in improving MLVGMs' utility for SSCRL. The introduction of a Continuous Sampling strategy also reflects a forward-thinking approach to data generation, which is critically needed in areas facing data scarcity. However, without substantial empirical validation in a wider range of applications, the broader claim regarding the surpassing performance of synthetic views over real data should be treated with caution. Overall, given the relevant advancements and systematic approach in this paper, I would assign a score of **8**. This score reflects strong contributions tempered by some reservations about novelty and the need for further validation.  **Score: 8**

### Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13720v1)
- **Authors**: Anna Kruspe
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) reflect the biases in their training data and, by extension, those of the people who created this training data. Detecting, analyzing, and mitigating such biases is becoming a focus of research. One type of bias that has been understudied so far are geocultural biases. Those can be caused by an imbalance in the representation of different geographic regions and cultures in the training data, but also by value judgments contained therein. In this paper, we make a first step towards analyzing musical biases in LLMs, particularly ChatGPT and Mixtral. We conduct two experiments. In the first, we prompt LLMs to provide lists of the "Top 100" musical contributors of various categories and analyze their countries of origin. In the second experiment, we ask the LLMs to numerically rate various aspects of the musical cultures of different countries. Our results indicate a strong preference of the LLMs for Western music cultures in both experiments.
- **Summary**: ### Summary  The paper "Musical ethnocentrism in Large Language Models" explores geocultural biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on their representation of different musical cultures. The authors argue that biases present in LLMs, like ChatGPT and Mixtral, can arise from an uneven distribution of geographic and cultural data in the training sets. The research includes two experiments: the first prompts the LLMs to list the "Top 100" musical contributors across categories while analyzing their countries of origin; the second asks LLMs to numerically rate aspects of musical cultures from various countries. Findings reveal a significant inclination towards Western musical traditions, highlighting the potential ethnocentrism ingrained in these models. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty This paper provides a relatively novel contribution by investigating the specific area of musical ethnocentrism within LLMs, a subject that has not been extensively covered in existing literature. While biases in AI and LLMs are increasingly under scrutiny, the focus on musical traditions offers a fresh perspective that is crucial for understanding cultural representation in AI outputs. #### Significance The implications of the findings are significant, as they highlight the risks of perpetuating cultural biases through AI tools, which are increasingly integrated into everyday life. By clearly demonstrating the limitations of LLMs in accurately representing global musical diversity, this research could inform developers and researchers to take a more balanced approach in training data selection. #### Strengths - The methodological approach is clear and well-structured, allowing readers to understand the specific experiments conducted. - The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about bias in AI, thus supplementing existing research. #### Weaknesses - The paper lacks a deeper exploration of the underlying reasons behind the observed biases, such as the cultural, historical, or societal factors that may contribute to the underrepresentation of non-Western musical traditions. - The scope of the study could be broadened to include qualitative analyses of how LLMs interpret and categorize musical contributions beyond numerical ratings and rankings. #### Potential Influence The paper potentially serves as a catalyst for further research into cultural biases in AI systems. By identifying and documenting this specific bias, it encourages additional scrutiny of the cultural dimensions of AI outputs and motivates a call for more representative training data. Considering the thoughtful approach and the relevance of the issue discussed, together with its strengths and areas for improvement, I assign a **score of 7**. This score reflects the paper's notable contribution to highlighting a critical issue within the field of AI research, while also acknowledging its limitations in-depth analysis and exploration of the biases identified.

### RPO: Retrieval Preference Optimization for Robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13726v1)
- **Authors**: Shi-Qi Yan, Zhen-Hua Ling
- **Abstract**: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has exhibited promise in utilizing external knowledge, its generation process heavily depends on the quality and accuracy of the retrieved context. Large language models (LLMs) struggle to evaluate the correctness of non-parametric knowledge retrieved externally when it differs from internal memorization, leading to knowledge conflicts during response generation. To this end, we introduce the Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), a lightweight and effective alignment method to adaptively leverage multi-source knowledge based on retrieval relevance. An implicit representation of retrieval relevance is derived and incorporated into the reward model to integrate retrieval evaluation and response generation into a single model, solving the problem that previous methods necessitate the additional procedure to assess the retrieval quality. Notably, RPO is the only RAG-dedicated alignment approach that quantifies the awareness of retrieval relevance in training, overcoming mathematical obstacles. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that RPO outperforms RAG by 4-10% in accuracy without any extra component, exhibiting its robust generalization.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Retrieval Preference Optimization (RPO), an innovative alignment method that enhances Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models by addressing the challenges associated with the accuracy of externally retrieved contextual information. It highlights that large language models often struggle with knowledge discrepancies between retrieved and internally memorized information, which can lead to conflicts in generated responses. RPO aims to optimize the retrieval process by integrating an implicit representation of retrieval relevance within the reward model, allowing the model to evaluate retrieval quality during response generation seamlessly. The experimental results suggest that RPO improves model accuracy by 4-10% over traditional RAG methods without necessitating additional components, indicating broader applicability and robust generalization capabilities across four datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of RPO lies in its approach to unify retrieval evaluation and response generation within a single framework, a step that is notably lacking in existing methodologies. By addressing the retrieval relevance directly and including it in the training process, RPO attempts to bridge a critical gap which is essential for improving the reliability of outcomes in knowledge-based systems. Additionally, RPO's ability to quantify retrieval awareness during training provides a distinctive edge by resolving existing mathematical complexities. However, the paper could strengthen its impact by addressing the scalability implications of RPO, particularly how it performs under varying retrieval conditions or in diverse domains. Moreover, while the results are promising, a more detailed analysis comparing the performance of RPO across various model architectures and retrieval strategies would substantiate its general applicability and robustness. Despite these concerns, RPO presents a significant advancement in the area of retrieval-augmented generative models, successfully introducing and proving its methodology through rigorous experimentation. The potential ramifications of RPO in mitigating knowledge conflicts in generation tasks could spur additional research and developers’ interest in creating more adaptable and efficient models. Overall, the contributions of this work to enhancing the effectiveness of retrieval mechanisms in language generation warrants a high score. **Score: 8**

### Pseudocode-Injection Magic: Enabling LLMs to Tackle Graph Computational Tasks
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13731v1)
- **Authors**: Chang Gong, Wanrui Bian, Zhijie Zhang, Weiguo Zheng
- **Abstract**: Graph computational tasks are inherently challenging and often demand the development of advanced algorithms for effective solutions. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential to address these tasks. However, existing approaches are constrained by LLMs' limited capability to comprehend complex graph structures and their high inference costs, rendering them impractical for handling large-scale graphs. Inspired by human approaches to graph problems, we introduce a novel framework, PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks), which consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation. In this framework, LLMs are tasked with understanding the problem and extracting relevant information to generate correct code. The responsibility for analyzing the graph structure and executing the code is delegated to the interpreter. We inject task-related pseudocodes into the prompts to further assist the LLMs in generating efficient code. We also employ cost-effective trial-and-error techniques to ensure that the LLM-generated code executes correctly. Unlike other methods that require invoking LLMs for each individual test case, PIE only calls the LLM during the code generation phase, allowing the generated code to be reused and significantly reducing inference costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIE outperforms existing baselines in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper introduces a novel framework named PIE (Pseudocode-Injection-Enhanced LLM Reasoning for Graph Computational Tasks) to enhance the ability of large language models (LLMs) in solving graph-related computational tasks. Traditional approaches face limitations due to LLMs' difficulties in understanding complex graph structures and high inference costs. PIE consists of three key steps: problem understanding, prompt design, and code generation, where LLMs generate code based on problem extraction, while the interpreter analyzes graph structures and executes the generated code. The innovation lies in injecting task-related pseudocode into the prompts, which aids LLMs in producing effective solutions without requiring repeated LLM calls for individual test cases, thereby lowering computational costs. Empirical results indicate that PIE demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing benchmarks. ### Critical Evaluation  The novelty of the paper lies primarily in its innovative framework that combines pseudocode injection with LLM capabilities specifically for graph computational tasks. By minimizing the reliance on real-time LLM calls and instead allowing the generated code to be reused, PIE addresses a significant barrier to the practical application of LLMs, making the approach both cost-effective and more scalable. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The pseudocode injection technique is a fresh contribution that allows LLMs to leverage structured programming logic effectively. 2. **Efficiency Gains**: The reduction in inference costs and improved efficiency in execution represents a practical advancement for deploying LLMs in complex computational tasks. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper provides extensive experimental results, demonstrating the utility of PIE against established baselines, which bolsters the claims made by the authors. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the framework shows promising results, the paper may benefit from a broader range of graph types or complexities in its experimental evaluation. 2. **Generalizability Concerns**: The reliance on LLMs may still pose challenges in different domains of graph tasks, especially those requiring fine-tuned domain knowledge or multimodal data. 3. **Potential Overfitting**: The significant focus on reducing inference costs could lead to a trade-off concerning the adaptability of generated solutions in various real-world scenarios. Overall, the paper makes a commendable contribution to the understanding of LLM applications in graph theory, particularly in enhancing performance and cost-effectiveness. However, the generalizability of the approach and broader applications need further exploration. **Score: 8**

### An Empirical Study of Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: Challenges and Opportunities
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13742v1)
- **Authors**: Zezhou Yang, Sirong Chen, Cuiyun Gao, Zhenhao Li, Xing Hu, Kui Liu, Xin Xia
- **Abstract**: Code generation aims to automatically generate code snippets of specific programming language according to natural language descriptions. The continuous advancements in deep learning, particularly pre-trained models, have empowered the code generation task to achieve remarkable performance. One main challenge of pre-trained models for code generation is the semantic gap between natural language requirements and source code. To address the issue, prior studies typically adopt a retrieval-augmented framework for the task, where the similar code snippets collected by a retrieval process can be leveraged to help understand the requirements and provide guidance for the generation process. However, there is a lack of systematic study on the application of this framework for code generation, including the impact of the final generated results and the specific usage of the framework. In this paper, we choose three popular pre-trained code models, namely CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5, to assess the impact of the quality and utilization of retrieved code on the retrieval-augmented framework. Our analysis shows that the retrieval-augmented framework is beneficial for improving the performance of the existing pre-trained models. We also provide suggestions on the utilization of the retrieval-augmented code generation framework: BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion are recommended due to their convenience and superior performance. Sketch Filling Fusion, which extracts a sketch of relevant code, could help the model improve its performance further. Additionally, we conduct experiments to investigate the influence of the retrieval-augmented framework on large language models for code generation, showing the effectiveness of the framework, and we discuss the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs in each phase within the framework.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the challenges and potential of retrieval-augmented code generation, which aims to automatically convert natural language descriptions into code snippets. While advancements in deep learning have propelled code generation quality, a notable obstacle is the semantic gap between natural language and source code. To mitigate this gap, prior research has often implemented a retrieval-augmented framework, where similar code snippets retrieved in response to a natural language query assist in generating the desired code. This study evaluates three leading pre-trained models: CodeGen, UniXcoder, and CodeT5. Results indicate that integrating a retrieval-augmented approach improves the models' performance. The authors recommend specific methods for retrieval integration, such as BM25 and Sequential Integration Fusion, while also introducing the need for Sketch Filling Fusion. Additionally, they analyze the impact of retrieval-augmented approaches on large language models, highlighting a balance between enhanced performance and computational costs. **Evaluation:** The study offers several significant contributions to the field of code generation. First, it provides a much-needed systematic evaluation of the retrieval-augmented framework, addressing a gap in the current literature. Previous studies frequently discussed individual components but failed to offer a cohesive view of the framework's applicability and results, making this paper a critical resource for researchers and practitioners alike. The investigation of specific retrieval methods further enriches the discourse. By recommending BM25, Sequential Integration Fusion, and Sketch Filling Fusion, the authors provide practical insights that could influence future implementations of code generation tools, thereby benefitting both academia and industry. The paper’s empirical experiments reinforce these recommendations and facilitate a deeper understanding of how retrieval-augmented networks can improve coding models. However, the study could have presented a deeper analysis of the limitations inherent in retrieval-based approaches, such as potential biases in the retrieved code or the quality of the natural language requirements. Additionally, while the discussion on the trade-off between performance improvement and computational costs is useful, it could benefit from quantitative metrics to underscore these claims. Overall, the paper's novelty lies in its focused approach to evaluating and enhancing existing models through retrieval integration. Given its systematic analysis, practical contributions, and potential to impact future research, I would rate this paper favorably. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's contribution to understanding and optimizing retrieval-augmented code generation, while acknowledging areas that could benefit from further exploration.

- **Abstract**: This paper introduces GPT-HTree, a framework combining hierarchical clustering, decision trees, and large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. By leveraging hierarchical clustering to segment individuals based on salient features, resampling techniques to balance class distributions, and decision trees to tailor classification paths within each cluster, GPT-HTree ensures both accuracy and interpretability. LLMs enhance the framework by generating human-readable cluster descriptions, bridging quantitative analysis with actionable insights.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents GPT-HTree, a novel framework that integrates hierarchical clustering, decision trees, and large language models (LLMs) for explainable classification tasks. The approach first employs hierarchical clustering to group individuals based on key features, and utilizes resampling techniques to address class imbalances. Decision trees are then used to craft customized classification pathways for each cluster, enhancing both the accuracy of the model and its interpretability. Additionally, LLMs assist in generating clear, human-readable descriptions of these clusters, thereby connecting the quantitative outputs with actionable insights, which is especially valuable for decision-makers. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The introduction of GPT-HTree represents a compelling intersection of various methodologies — hierarchical clustering, decision trees, and LLMs — which have been traditionally applied separately within the realms of machine learning and explainability. By creating a cohesive framework that effectively integrates these components, the authors provide a potentially meaningful advancement in generating interpretable models in classification tasks.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of hierarchical clustering and decision trees, enhanced by LLMs, is relatively rare, showcasing an innovative approach to address issues of interpretability in AI. 2. **Practical Application**: By generating cluster descriptions that are human-readable, the framework makes the outputs of machine learning models more accessible to practitioners without deep technical expertise. 3. **Flexibility and Interpretability**: The use of decision trees provides a transparent decision-making framework, which is essential in high-stakes domains like healthcare or finance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: The integration of multiple frameworks could lead to increased complexity in model interpretation, as practitioners may need to understand both clustering and hierarchical decision making. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper would benefit from a comparative analysis against existing methods to thoroughly demonstrate improvement in both accuracy and interpretability. 3. **Assumptions of Data Distribution**: The performance of the model may be contingent upon the underlying distribution of data, which might not always favor hierarchical clustering. In summary, while the GPT-HTree framework offers an exciting novel approach to classification that enhances interpretability through human-like descriptions, the effectiveness of such a framework in practice, and its generalizability across different datasets or domains remains to be thoroughly evaluated. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, particularly in areas prioritizing explainability and interpretability. However, the need for more empirical validation and comparative studies to solidify its position precludes a higher score, highlighting potential areas for future research to bolster its significance and applicability.

### UGMathBench: A Diverse and Dynamic Benchmark for Undergraduate-Level Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13766v1)
- **Authors**: Xin Xu, Jiaxin Zhang, Tianhao Chen, Zitong Chao, Jishan Hu, Can Yang
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in mathematical reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive and fair evaluation of their capabilities. However, existing benchmarks often fall short, either lacking extensive coverage of undergraduate-level mathematical problems or probably suffering from test-set contamination. To address these issues, we introduce UGMathBench, a diverse and dynamic benchmark specifically designed for evaluating undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning with LLMs. UGMathBench comprises 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, featuring 10 distinct answer types. Each problem includes three randomized versions, with additional versions planned for release as leading open-source LLMs become saturated in UGMathBench. Furthermore, we propose two key metrics: effective accuracy (EAcc), which measures the percentage of correctly solved problems across all three versions, and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which assesses reasoning robustness by calculating the difference between the average accuracy across all versions and EAcc. Our extensive evaluation of 23 leading LLMs reveals that the highest EAcc achieved is 56.3\% by OpenAI-o1-mini, with large $\Delta$ values observed across different models. This highlights the need for future research aimed at developing "large reasoning models" with high EAcc and $\Delta = 0$. We anticipate that the release of UGMathBench, along with its detailed evaluation codes, will serve as a valuable resource to advance the development of LLMs in solving mathematical problems.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces UGMathBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) at the undergraduate level. Existing benchmarks are criticized for inadequate coverage and potential contamination issues, which UGMathBench addresses by offering 5,062 problems across 16 subjects and 111 topics, including ten types of answers. Each problem has three randomized versions, with more to come as LLMs evolve. The authors introduce two metrics for evaluation: effective accuracy (EAcc) and reasoning gap ($\Delta$), which aim to capture the performance and reasoning robustness of LLMs. Evaluations show that the best EAcc achieved by models is 56.3%, indicating room for improvement in mathematical reasoning for LLMs. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of the UGMathBench as a resource for future research in this area. **Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies primarily in the development of the UGMathBench benchmark, which seeks to fill a gap in evaluating LLMs specifically on undergraduate-level mathematical reasoning. This is significant because previous benchmarks may not adequately represent the breadth and complexity of the required reasoning skills. By including a large and diverse set of problems with randomized versions, the authors aim to enhance the robustness of evaluations, addressing issues like test-set contamination. However, there are some noteworthy weaknesses. First, while the creation of UGMathBench is valuable, the impact of the benchmark may depend on its adoption by the research community and whether it leads to substantial improvements in LLM performance. Second, the paper does not sufficiently explore specific limitations of current LLMs in the context of mathematical reasoning beyond the metrics introduced. Moreover, while the proposed metrics are fine, their practical application in guiding model enhancements is not deeply discussed. The findings presented in the paper reveal a clear need for improvement in LLMs, but the overall success of UGMathBench as a tool will depend on ongoing engagement with it by researchers and developers. Overall, the contribution of UGMathBench is a positive step toward addressing the evaluation of mathematical reasoning in LLMs, though its long-term impact will require further validation and community engagement. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with notable novelty, balanced by a cautious perspective regarding its impact due to the mentioned limitations. While the benchmark is a timely and useful addition, its effectiveness in driving substantial advancements in mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs remains to be seen.

### An Efficient Diffusion-based Non-Autoregressive Solver for Traveling Salesman Problem
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13767v1)
- **Authors**: Mingzhao Wang, You Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yubin Xiao, Xuan Wu, Wei Pang, Yuan Jiang, Hui Yang, Peng Zhao, Yuanshu Li
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in neural models have shown considerable promise in solving Traveling Salesman Problems (TSPs) without relying on much hand-crafted engineering. However, while non-autoregressive (NAR) approaches benefit from faster inference through parallelism, they typically deliver solutions of inferior quality compared to autoregressive ones. To enhance the solution quality while maintaining fast inference, we propose DEITSP, a diffusion model with efficient iterations tailored for TSP that operates in a NAR manner. Firstly, we introduce a one-step diffusion model that integrates the controlled discrete noise addition process with self-consistency enhancement, enabling optimal solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions. Secondly, we design a dual-modality graph transformer to bolster the extraction and fusion of features from node and edge modalities, while further accelerating the inference with fewer layers. Thirdly, we develop an efficient iterative strategy that alternates between adding and removing noise to improve exploration compared to previous diffusion methods. Additionally, we devise a scheduling framework to progressively refine the solution space by adjusting noise levels, facilitating a smooth search for optimal solutions. Extensive experiments on real-world and large-scale TSP instances demonstrate that DEITSP performs favorably against existing neural approaches in terms of solution quality, inference latency, and generalization ability. Our code is available at $\href{https://github.com/DEITSP/DEITSP}{https://github.com/DEITSP/DEITSP}$.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents DEITSP, an innovative approach for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a diffusion-based non-autoregressive (NAR) method. Acknowledging the common trade-off in non-autoregressive models between speed and solution quality, the authors introduce several key enhancements. Firstly, they employ a one-step diffusion model that enhances solution prediction through simultaneous denoising of multiple solutions while integrating controlled noisy processes. Secondly, a dual-modality graph transformer is introduced to effectively combine features from nodes and edges while speeding up inference with fewer transformation layers. Thirdly, an iterative strategy that alternates noise addition and removal is developed to enhance exploration. A scheduling framework is also proposed to refine the solution space progressively. Extensive experiments show that DEITSP outperforms existing neural methods in terms of solution quality, inference speed, and generalization. ### Critical Evaluation The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its hybrid approach that combines diffusion models with non-autoregressive methodologies specifically tailored for the TSP—an area known for its computational complexity. The integration of one-step diffusion with self-consistency and a dual-modality transformer represents an innovative way to leverage the strengths of various modeling approaches to improve the exploration of potential solutions. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of diffusion processes within NAR frameworks represents a compelling synthesis that could inspire further research in both fields. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The extensive experiments demonstrated not just improvements in performance metrics but targeted enhancements in practical applications, signaling the model's readiness for real-world usage. 3. **Open Source:** The availability of the implementation fosters reproducibility and allows further exploration by other researchers. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed methods, particularly the dual-modality graph transformer and iterative noise adjustment, may be difficult to implement and tune in practice, limiting accessibility for practitioners. 2. **Comparative Baselines:** While the results are promising, the comparison with existing methods may lack depth, as not all state-of-the-art models may have been included, which is crucial to convincingly position DEITSP within the landscape of TSP solvers. 3. **Generalization Claims:** Although claims about generalization ability are made, the experiments may not fully address various edge cases commonly encountered in TSPs that reflect a real-world scenario. ### Score Justification Taking into account the novel contributions, the potential for significant impact on TSP research, and the paper’s experimental rigors while also recognizing its complexities and some weaknesses in comparative depth, I assign a score of **8**. This reflects a solid contribution to the field that may not be groundbreaking in a historic sense but stands to meaningfully advance methodologies for TSP and related optimization challenges. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Erjia Xiao, Hao Cheng, Jing Shao, Jinhao Duan, Kaidi Xu, Le Yang, Jindong Gu, Renjing Xu
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot performance across various natural language processing tasks. The integration of multimodal encoders extends their capabilities, enabling the development of Multimodal Large Language Models that process vision, audio, and text. However, these capabilities also raise significant security concerns, as these models can be manipulated to generate harmful or inappropriate content through jailbreak. While extensive research explores the impact of modality-specific input edits on text-based LLMs and Large Vision-Language Models in jailbreak, the effects of audio-specific edits on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) remain underexplored. Hence, this paper addresses this gap by investigating how audio-specific edits influence LALMs inference regarding jailbreak. We introduce the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET), which enables audio-modality edits such as tone adjustment, word emphasis, and noise injection, and the Edited Audio Datasets (EADs), a comprehensive audio jailbreak benchmark. We also conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LALMs to assess their robustness under different audio edits. This work lays the groundwork for future explorations on audio-modality interactions in LALMs security.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Tune In, Act Up: Exploring the Impact of Audio Modality-Specific Edits on Large Audio Language Models in Jailbreak" investigates the security vulnerabilities of Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) through the lens of audio-specific edits, a relatively underexplored area in the context of jailbreak techniques. It introduces the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET) for making variable audio edits such as tone adjustments and noise injections, and presents Edited Audio Datasets (EADs) as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of these edits on LALM performance. The findings suggest that specific audio edits can significantly affect the way these models process inputs, thus altering their potential susceptibility to generating harmful content. The research aims to fill the gap in understanding how LALMs can be manipulated via audio inputs and sets the stage for future investigations into audio modality interactions and model security. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The investigation of audio-specific edits in LALMs, especially in reference to security vulnerabilities, is an innovative approach considering that most prior work has focused on text-based and vision-language models. This opens a new research avenue essential for ensuring the responsible use of multimodal AI technologies. 2. **Practical Tools:** The introduction of the Audio Editing Toolbox (AET) and Edited Audio Datasets (EADs) represents significant contributions that can be widely used for further research and evaluation by other scholars in the field. They effectively lay the foundation for exploring exploitation techniques associated with LALMs. 3. **Relevance:** With the increasing prevalence of multimodal AI applications, understanding audio interactions and security implications is timely and relevant, catering to concerns in AI safety and ethical implications of deployment. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Depth of Analysis:** While the paper provides a groundwork for exploring audio edits, the depth and breadth of the experimental results could be enhanced. More extensive testing across varied LALMs and comprehensive scenarios would provide stronger evidence of the robustness and generality of the findings. 2. **Comparative Framework:** The paper could benefit from a more detailed comparative analysis between LALMs and other types of models, especially highlighting how audio interacts with other modalities. This would contextualize the findings more effectively within the broader field of multimodal research. 3. **Potential Overlooked Concerns:** The paper primarily focuses on the audio modality, which while necessary, may overlook interactions that could arise when combining edits across different modalities, thus limiting insights into comprehensive security vulnerabilities. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents a novel exploration into audio-specific vulnerabilities in LALMs with practical tools and a relevant research agenda. While there are areas for improvement in terms of experimental rigor and comparative analysis, the initial findings are impactful and pave the way for future investigations into security challenges in the evolving field of AI. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13773v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaofeng Wang, Yiming Wang, Wenhong Zhu, Rui Wang
- **Abstract**: Geometric ability is a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for advanced spatial comprehension and abstract thinking. Existing datasets primarily evaluate LLMs on their final answers, but they cannot truly measure their true understanding of geometric structures, as LLMs can arrive at correct answers by coincidence. To fill this gap, we introduce the GeomRel dataset, designed to evaluate LLMs' understanding of geometric structures by isolating the core step of geometric relationship identification in problem-solving. Using this benchmark, we conduct thorough evaluations of diverse LLMs and identify key limitations in understanding geometric structures. We further propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which enhances LLMs' ability to identify geometric relationships, resulting in significant performance improvements.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper investigates the geometric abilities of large language models (LLMs), highlighting a critical gap in the assessment methodologies used to evaluate these models. Traditional testing primarily focuses on final outputs, which may mask the models' actual understanding of geometric relationships, as they can achieve correct results by chance. To address this shortcoming, the authors introduce the GeomRel dataset, specifically designed to assess LLMs based on their ability to identify geometric relationships rather than just arriving at a correct answer. Through evaluations using this dataset, the authors identify significant limitations in the current understanding of geometric structures among various LLMs. In response to these findings, they propose the Geometry Chain-of-Thought (GeoCoT) method, which aims to improve LLMs' capabilities in recognizing geometric relationships, leading to notable enhancements in performance. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Dataset**: The introduction of the GeomRel dataset fills a critical gap in benchmarking LLMs' understanding of geometry, providing a more focused criterion for evaluation beyond mere answer accuracy. 2. **Addressing Challenges in LLMs**: The paper tackles the often-overlooked challenge of spatial comprehension in LLMs, which is increasingly relevant as these models are applied in more complex domains. 3. **New Methodology**: The proposal of the GeoCoT method represents a valuable step towards improving LLMs’ geometric reasoning capabilities, indicating potential for advancement in future model training approaches. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the focus on geometric relationships is insightful, the findings may be limited to this domain, potentially lacking broader implications for other areas of reasoning in LLMs. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: The evaluation of existing LLMs may not go deep enough into exploring why these models fail at understanding geometric relationships, leaving questions about underlying causes unanswered. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The GeoCoT method could increase the complexity of model training, and the scalability of these improvements across various LLM architectures is not fully addressed. **Potential Influence**: This paper can stimulate further research into not only geometric comprehension in LLMs but also the development of evaluation metrics that assess understanding across various domains. It can encourage future studies to expand this research into more abstract reasoning areas. Overall, considering the innovative contributions of the dataset and the proposed methodology, alongside the need for deeper explorations of the limitations identified, I assign a score that reflects both the promise and the areas that require further development. **Score: 8**  ### Rationale The score of 8 signifies a substantial contribution to the field, recognizing the paper's novelty and its potential to influence future research directions while also acknowledging certain weaknesses. The creation of a targeted dataset and an innovative method are commendable, yet there are aspects that future work must address for a more holistic understanding of LLMs’ capabilities in geometric reasoning and beyond.

- **Abstract**: We present Explainable XR, an end-to-end framework for analyzing user behavior in diverse eXtended Reality (XR) environments by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data interpretation assistance. Existing XR user analytics frameworks face challenges in handling cross-virtuality - AR, VR, MR - transitions, multi-user collaborative application scenarios, and the complexity of multimodal data. Explainable XR addresses these challenges by providing a virtuality-agnostic solution for the collection, analysis, and visualization of immersive sessions.

We demonstrate the versatility of Explainable XR by demonstrating five use-case scenarios, in both individual and collaborative XR applications across virtualities. Our technical evaluation and user studies show that Explainable XR provides a highly usable analytics solution for understanding user actions and delivering multifaceted, actionable insights into user behaviors in immersive environments.

### Not Every AI Problem is a Data Problem: We Should Be Intentional About Data Scaling
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13779v1)
- **Authors**: Tanya Rodchenko, Natasha Noy, Nino Scherrer, Jennifer Prendki
- **Abstract**: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the topology of data itself informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper argues that while the current trend in training Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasizes the accumulation of larger datasets, there is a need for a more intentional approach to data acquisition. It suggests that not all tasks in AI will benefit equally from increased data and that understanding the topology of data can guide researchers in identifying which tasks are worth focusing on for data scaling. The authors posit that this understanding should also inform the evolution of computational paradigms to address scenarios where simply increasing data may be insufficient or inefficient. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant re-evaluation of the prevailing notion that "more data is always better" in the development of AI, specifically LLMs. This perspective is particularly relevant given the escalating costs and resources associated with data collection and model training. The novelty lies in the emphasis on the qualitative aspects of data and task suitability, rather than sheer quantity—a viewpoint that has been underexplored in mainstream discussions.  Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Timeliness:** As models grow larger, the community increasingly faces challenges related to data acquisition, ethical concerns, and resource allocation. 2. **Conceptual Framework:** Providing a framework where task topology is considered allows for a structured approach to data selection, potentially leading to more efficient model performance. 3. **Call for Intentionality:** The push for intentional data scaling practices is important, advocating for research rigor and ethical considerations. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Abstractness:** The framework proposed may lack concrete methodologies for practitioners to apply, making it difficult to translate the theory into actionable steps. 2. **Generalizability:** The argument, while compelling, may not be universally applicable across all AI domains, and specific validation through case studies or empirical data is lacking. 3. **Underexplored Considerations:** While topology is emphasized, the paper does not sufficiently address other complications, such as data quality issues or biases, that interplay with data scaling. Overall, the paper proposes a well-founded shift in perspective that could inspire more nuanced approaches to AI development. However, its impact is somewhat tempered by the lack of practical guidelines and empirical backing. Therefore, while the paper does provide a notable contribution to the field, its realization in practice may need further elaboration. **Score: 7**

### Unveiling the Power of Noise Priors: Enhancing Diffusion Models for Mobile Traffic Prediction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13794v1)
- **Authors**: Zhi Sheng, Yuan Yuan, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li
- **Abstract**: Accurate prediction of mobile traffic, \textit{i.e.,} network traffic from cellular base stations, is crucial for optimizing network performance and supporting urban development. However, the non-stationary nature of mobile traffic, driven by human activity and environmental changes, leads to both regular patterns and abrupt variations. Diffusion models excel in capturing such complex temporal dynamics due to their ability to capture the inherent uncertainties. Most existing approaches prioritize designing novel denoising networks but often neglect the critical role of noise itself, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective by emphasizing the role of noise in the denoising process. Our analysis reveals that noise fundamentally shapes mobile traffic predictions, exhibiting distinct and consistent patterns. We propose NPDiff, a framework that decomposes noise into \textit{prior} and \textit{residual} components, with the \textit{prior} derived from data dynamics, enhancing the model's ability to capture both regular and abrupt variations. NPDiff can seamlessly integrate with various diffusion-based prediction models, delivering predictions that are effective, efficient, and robust. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves superior performance with an improvement over 30\%, offering a new perspective on leveraging diffusion models in this domain.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper addresses the challenge of accurately predicting mobile traffic from cellular base stations, which is vital for enhancing network performance amid the unpredictable nature of traffic influenced by human behavior and environmental factors. While diffusion models are effective in capturing temporal dynamics, existing methodologies often overlook the significance of noise in the denoising process. This paper introduces NPDiff, a novel framework that decomposes noise into prior and residual components, where the prior reflects data dynamics. By harnessing this innovative perspective, NPDiff enhances the model's capability to accommodate both regular and sudden traffic fluctuations. The methodology is shown to integrate well with various diffusion-based models and has been tested with extensive experiments, achieving over a 30% improvement in prediction performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper brings forth a crucial and underexplored aspect of diffusion models—noise in the denoising process, which is especially relevant in the context of mobile traffic prediction. This departure from the conventional focus on model architecture and instead honing in on the significance of noise showcases an innovative perspective that could prompt further research into similar approaches across various domains. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The focus on the role of noise as a predictive factor is innovative and adds a significant layer to current methodologies in mobile traffic prediction. 2. **Practical Implications**: The proposed framework could have wide-ranging ramifications for improving network operations in urban settings, which is timely given the increasing reliance on mobile communication. 3. **Performance Improvement**: The reported 30% enhancement in prediction accuracy indicates strong empirical validation, suggesting that the framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality**: While the paper claims that NPDiff can integrate with various diffusion models, further clarification on the boundaries of its applicability is necessary. 2. **Complexity**: The introduction of noise decomposition may add complexity to the modeling process, raising questions about the trade-off between interpretability and improved performance. 3. **Scalability**: The experiments should detail how well the framework scales with increasing data size or network growth, as practical implementation requires robustness in diverse environments. Taking all of this into consideration, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of mobile traffic prediction using diffusion models. The innovative emphasis on noise priors is particularly timely and necessary, potentially influencing future research directions. **Score: 8**

### Generating Realistic Forehead-Creases for User Verification via Conditioned Piecewise Polynomial Curves
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13889v1)
- **Authors**: Abhishek Tandon, Geetanjali Sharma, Gaurav Jaswal, Aditya Nigam, Raghavendra Ramachandra
- **Abstract**: We propose a trait-specific image generation method that models forehead creases geometrically using B-spline and B\'ezier curves. This approach ensures the realistic generation of both principal creases and non-prominent crease patterns, effectively constructing detailed and authentic forehead-crease images. These geometrically rendered images serve as visual prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image translation model, which generates corresponding mated samples. The resulting novel synthetic identities are then used to train a forehead-crease verification network. To enhance intra-subject diversity in the generated samples, we employ two strategies: (a) perturbing the control points of B-splines under defined constraints to maintain label consistency, and (b) applying image-level augmentations to the geometric visual prompts, such as dropout and elastic transformations, specifically tailored to crease patterns. By integrating the proposed synthetic dataset with real-world data, our method significantly improves the performance of forehead-crease verification systems under a cross-database verification protocol.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel image generation technique for forehead creases utilized in user verification tasks. It employs geometrical modeling through B-spline and Bézier curves to create realistic images of both prominent and subtle forehead creases. These images are then used as prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image model to generate mated samples, enhancing a synthetic dataset for training a forehead-crease verification network. To improve diversity among the synthetic samples, the authors introduce two strategies: perturbing control points of B-splines while maintaining label consistency, and employing tailored image-level augmentations. The integration of this synthetic dataset with real-world data yields improved performance in forehead-crease verification, demonstrated through a cross-database protocol. **Evaluation:** The paper exhibits clear novel contributions to the domain of biometric verification, particularly by addressing the generation of a trait-specific element, forehead creases. The geometric modeling approach using hierarchical curves (B-splines and Bézier) is particularly innovative, positioning it as a significant departure from common generative adversarial networks (GANs) typically used in synthetic data generation. This method specifically caters to enhancing the realism of the images, which is crucial for the verification task. The methods employed to introduce diversity in generated samples are well-conceived, addressing potential pitfalls of overfitting to specific patterns in the training data. By ensuring that the synthetic images retain label consistency while being diverse, the authors take a critical step towards enhancing the robustness of their verification methodology. However, the implications of this work raise some concerns. The performance improvements in real applications and across diverse datasets, while promising, may benefit from comprehensive evaluations that detail the robustness of the system against various adversarial attacks or differences in user populations. The applicability of this method in broader biometric systems or its ability to scale with increasing diversity remains to be established. Overall, the novelty of the proposed approach and its specific applicability to forehead-crease verification present a meaningful contribution to biometric technologies. However, the limitations regarding broader applicability and potential need for robustness against real-world variations temper the impact somewhat. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the strong innovative framework the authors provide and significant advances in synthetic identity training for biometric systems, while acknowledging the challenges in validating their performance under more generalized conditions.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13926v1)
- **Authors**: Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Chengzhuo Tong, Zhizheng Zhao, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Pheng-Ann Heng
- **Abstract**: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation. Code and models are released at https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Image-Generation-CoT

This could encourage subsequent research to explore similar approaches, possibly influencing both foundational theory and practical implementations in machine learning and artificial intelligence. ### Score: 8 In conclusion, this paper represents a strong contribution to the field with its novel integration of CoT reasoning into image generation techniques. It successfully demonstrates substantial improvements in performance, which is highly relevant at this juncture in research. However, the need for broader applicability studies and clearer result representation prevents a higher score. Overall, the paper is well-positioned to inspire further research and innovation in image generation technologies.

### INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14014v1)
- **Authors**: Di You, Pier Luigi Dragotti
- **Abstract**: Generative diffusion models are becoming one of the most popular prior in image restoration (IR) tasks due to their remarkable ability to generate realistic natural images. Despite achieving satisfactory results, IR methods based on diffusion models present several limitations. First of all, most non-blind approaches require an analytical expression of the degradation model to guide the sampling process. Secondly, most existing blind approaches rely on families of pre-defined degradation models for training their deep networks. The above issues limit the flexibility of these approaches and so their ability to handle real-world degradation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel INN-guided probabilistic diffusion algorithm for non-blind and blind image restoration, namely INDIGO and BlindINDIGO, which combines the merits of the perfect reconstruction property of invertible neural networks (INN) with the strong generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion models. Specifically, we train the forward process of the INN to simulate an arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse to obtain an intermediate image that we use to guide the reverse diffusion sampling process through a gradient step. We also introduce an initialization strategy, to further improve the performance and inference speed of our algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively and visually on synthetic and real-world low-quality images.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "INDIGO+: A Unified INN-Guided Probabilistic Diffusion Algorithm for Blind and Non-Blind Image Restoration" focuses on addressing limitations in existing image restoration (IR) methods that utilize generative diffusion models. These methods often require specific knowledge of degradation models, which can limit their applicability to real-world scenarios. The authors propose two algorithms, INDIGO for non-blind restoration and BlindINDIGO for blind restoration, which integrate Invertible Neural Networks (INN) with pre-trained diffusion models to create a flexible framework for handling a variety of degradation processes. The approach involves training the forward process of the INN to replicate any degradation, while the inverse is used to enhance the reverse diffusion sampling. An initialization strategy is also introduced to boost performance and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that INDIGO+ competes well with leading methods in both quantitative and visual assessments on synthetic and real-world images. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The contribution of the paper is notable as it addresses a significant gap in image restoration techniques, particularly in enhancing the flexibility of both blind and non-blind approaches. By combining INN's reconstruction capabilities with diffusion models' generative power, the authors introduce a dual approach that does not rely on predefined degradation models. This combination represents a step forward in the field, allowing more diverse applications of image restoration. **Strengths:**  1. **Innovative Integration:** The merging of INN and diffusion models is an inventive solution to the problems outlined. It harnesses the strengths of both approaches, improving restoration flexibility. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper presents comprehensive experimental results demonstrating that INDIGO+ performs competitively against existing state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its practical applicability. 3. **Versatility:** This method is positioned to handle a wide range of degradation processes, making it particularly valuable for real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity:** The proposed methodology inherently involves additional complexity because it integrates multiple advanced technologies (INN and diffusion). The need for careful tuning and understanding of both methods may present challenges for practitioners. 2. **Performance Margins:** While results are competitive, the paper does not clearly detail in what specific scenarios the new approaches notably outperform existing methods, which could limit the perceived impact of the work. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The reliance on pre-trained models may raise questions about scalability for various applications and whether the approach can maintain performance across different types of datasets beyond those tested. **Potential Influence:** The introduction of the INDIGO and BlindINDIGO algorithms is likely to influence future research in image restoration, particularly in developing flexible, generative methods that can adapt to diverse real-world degradation scenarios. Their innovative approach may inspire further explorations in combining different model types to enhance restoration technology. **Score Justification:** Given its novel approach to a pressing issue in image restoration, solid experimental backing, and focus on real-world applicability, the paper merits a relatively high score. However, the complexities involved and the need for broader application validation temper its impact slightly. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Jianfeng Zhu, Ruoming Jin, Hailong Jiang, Yulan Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Karin G. Coifman
- **Abstract**: Adolescence is a critical stage often linked to risky behaviors, including substance use, with significant developmental and public health implications. Social media provides a lens into adolescent self-expression, but interpreting emotional and contextual signals remains complex. This study applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze adolescents' social media posts, uncovering emotional patterns (e.g., sadness, guilt, fear, joy) and contextual factors (e.g., family, peers, school) related to substance use. Heatmap and machine learning analyses identified key predictors of substance use-related posts. Negative emotions like sadness and guilt were significantly more frequent in substance use contexts, with guilt acting as a protective factor, while shame and peer influence heightened substance use risk. Joy was more common in non-substance use discussions. Peer influence correlated strongly with sadness, fear, and disgust, while family and school environments aligned with non-substance use. Findings underscore the importance of addressing emotional vulnerabilities and contextual influences, suggesting that collaborative interventions involving families, schools, and communities can reduce risk factors and foster healthier adolescent development.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates substance use among adolescents by analyzing social media posts using Large Language Models (LLMs). It identifies emotional and contextual drivers that influence substance use-related discussions. Key findings reveal that negative emotions, particularly sadness and guilt, are prevalent in posts about substance use, while joy is more common in non-substance use contexts. The study emphasizes that guilt may act as a protective factor against substance use, whereas shame and peer influence increase risk. Analyses also highlight how family and school settings tend to correlate with discussions outside of substance use. The authors advocate for collaborative interventions among families, schools, and communities to mitigate risks and support healthier adolescent development. ### Critical Evaluation This study represents a noteworthy contribution to the fields of addiction psychology and adolescent behavioral health. By employing Large Language Models, the authors leverage advanced analytical tools to distill complex emotional and contextual data from social media, which can provide invaluable insights into the factors influencing adolescent substance use. #### Strengths: 1. **Use of Innovative Methods**: The application of LLMs in analyzing emotional contexts from social media is both novel and timely, given the rising influence of social media on adolescent behavior.  2. **Identification of Emotional Patterns**: The differentiation between various emotional states related to substance use adds depth to our understanding of adolescent psychology, highlighting guilt as a protective factor. 3. **Implications for Intervention**: The findings advocate for a multi-faceted approach to preventing substance use, integrating family and community dynamics, which has practical significance for public health strategies. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Dependence on Social Media Data**: While social media offers rich data, it may not fully represent the experiences of all adolescents, potentially introducing bias based on demographic factors and accessibility to platforms. 2. **Causality vs. Correlation**: The paper primarily identifies correlations and emotional trends but does not thoroughly explore potential causal pathways or the underlying psychological mechanisms, which would be essential for developing effective interventions. 3. **Limited Scope**: The analysis may be limited to certain emotional contexts and missed exploring other significant factors like socioeconomic status, cultural influences, or developmental stages in-depth. #### Impact on the field: The insights provided by the authors highlight a crucial intersection between technology and psychological research, offering a framework that could inspire future research and interventions tailored to adolescent substance use dynamics. However, given the questions raised around causality and the diversity of adolescent experiences, further investigation is warranted.

- **Authors**: Andrey Palaev, Adil Khan, Syed M. Ahsan Kazmi
- **Abstract**: The advancement of text-to-image synthesis has introduced powerful generative models capable of creating realistic images from textual prompts. However, precise control over image attributes remains challenging, especially at the instance level. While existing methods offer some control through fine-tuning or auxiliary information, they often face limitations in flexibility and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), open-vocabulary detectors, cross-attention maps and intermediate activations of diffusion U-Net for instance-level image manipulation. Our method detects objects mentioned in the prompt and present in the generated image, enabling precise manipulation without extensive training or input masks. By incorporating cross-attention maps, our approach ensures coherence in manipulated images while controlling object positions. Our method enables precise manipulations at the instance level without fine-tuning or auxiliary information such as masks or bounding boxes. Code is available at https://github.com/Palandr123/DiffusionU-NetLLM
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a novel approach to instance-level image manipulation that addresses the limitations of existing methods in achieving precise control over image attributes. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs), open-vocabulary detectors, and cross-attention maps with intermediate activations of a diffusion U-Net, the proposed pipeline allows users to manipulate specific objects in generated images based on textual prompts. This method simplifies the manipulation process by eliminating the need for fine-tuning or additional input masks, while ensuring coherence in the resulting images. The authors provide a link to the code implementation, promoting accessibility for further research and application. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The paper introduces a unique combination of technologies—specifically the use of LLMs and diffusion U-Net cross-attention maps—for instance-level manipulation in image synthesis. The integration of these components is relatively novel and leverages advances in both natural language processing and computer vision. Previous methods often rely heavily on training data or manual input such as masks or bounding boxes, so the approach of using LLMs for object detection and manipulation represents an innovative shift. **Significance**:  The ability to easily manipulate image content at the instance level has broad implications for various fields such as graphic design, content creation, and virtual simulations. The proposed methodology has the potential to enhance user experience by providing simpler and more flexible manipulation tools, thereby making advanced generative models more user-friendly. The accessibility of the code also reflects a commitment to fostering further exploration in this area. **Strengths**: - The paper's interdisciplinary approach combining LLM and diffusion techniques is commendable. - The proposed pipeline minimizes the requirement for extensive training and complex input, broadening usability. - It emphasizes coherence in the final outputs which is crucial for quality in image generation. **Weaknesses**: - The paper could benefit from more empirical evaluations comparing their method against existing state-of-the-art techniques, particularly in terms of performance and quality metrics. - A discussion on the potential limitations and scenarios where their approach might fail would enhance the depth of the research. - Future work sections could elaborate more on possible directions for tackling existing limitations, especially regarding the contextual understanding of the LLMs. **Overall Assessment**:  The paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of image manipulation through its innovative approach and presented results. However, due to the limited empirical validation and critique of the method's shortcomings, it stops short of being a groundbreaking study. It lays a solid foundation for future research, particularly in refining and enhancing its applications. **Score: 7**

### LLMs are Vulnerable to Malicious Prompts Disguised as Scientific Language
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14073v1)
- **Authors**: Yubin Ge, Neeraja Kirtane, Hao Peng, Dilek Hakkani-Tür
- **Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) have been deployed in various real-world settings, concerns about the harm they may propagate have grown. Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, LLama3-405B-Instruct, Llama3-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data demonstrate that, the models' biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models' vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data in the training of LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to malicious prompts disguised in scientific language. Through experiments involving various models (including GPT-4 and Llama3), the authors demonstrate that these models exhibit increased biases and toxicity when misinterpretations of social science data are presented as legitimate evidence. Notably, such prompts can lead to the generation of false scientific arguments that suggest biases are advantageous, posing risks for misuse by malicious actors. The authors emphasize the influence of citation practices and ongoing dialogue on bias scores, urging for improved scrutiny in the use of scientific data during LLM training. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** This work is significant and timely as it addresses a growing concern within the AI community regarding the ethical implications and safety of deploying LLMs in real-world scenarios. The exploration of how scientific language can be manipulated to exploit biases in these models highlights an under-researched vulnerability, making the findings noteworthy. Moreover, the paper's focus on the specific mechanisms by which prompts can alter model outputs advances our understanding of LLM behaviors, which is crucial for improving model safety. However, while the identified issue is critical, the methodology could be regarded as somewhat limited in scope, focusing mainly on specific models without a comprehensive exploration of diverse LLM architectures or their training datasets. This could raise questions about the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the empirical demonstration is largely correlational and may require further validation to establish causative relationships. Despite these weaknesses, the paper successfully underscores the potential implications for safety and ethics in AI, making a compelling case for revisiting how LLMs are trained and deployed. Addressing the vulnerabilities highlighted in this paper could lead to improvements in model design and robustness, enhancing the safety of future AI applications. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's meaningful contribution to understanding the vulnerabilities of LLMs, while acknowledging its limitations in methodological breadth and the need for further validation of its findings. The work serves as a valuable foundation for future research aimed at enhancing AI safety, thereby exerting influence in the field.

- **Authors**: Po-Ting Lai, Chih-Hsuan Wei, Shubo Tian, Robert Leaman, Zhiyong Lu
- **Abstract**: Biological relation networks contain rich information for understanding the biological mechanisms behind the relationship of entities such as genes, proteins, diseases, and chemicals. The vast growth of biomedical literature poses significant challenges updating the network knowledge. The recent Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED) provides valuable manual annotations, facilitating the develop-ment of machine-learning and pre-trained language model approaches for automatically identifying novel document-level (inter-sentence context) relationships. Nonetheless, its annotations lack directionality (subject/object) for the entity roles, essential for studying complex biological networks. Herein we annotate the entity roles of the relationships in the BioRED corpus and subsequently propose a novel multi-task language model with soft-prompt learning to jointly identify the relationship, novel findings, and entity roles. Our results in-clude an enriched BioRED corpus with 10,864 directionality annotations. Moreover, our proposed method outperforms existing large language models such as the state-of-the-art GPT-4 and Llama-3 on two benchmarking tasks. Our source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/BioREDirect.

The authors address a significant limitation of the existing Biomedical Relation Extraction Dataset (BioRED), which provides valuable relationship annotations but lacks information on the roles of entities (subject/object). To address this gap, they annotate the BioRED dataset with directionality, resulting in 10,864 new annotations. Additionally, they propose a novel multi-task language model that utilizes soft-prompt learning to jointly identify relationships, novel findings, and entity roles. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to leading language models like GPT-4 and Llama-3 on benchmark tasks. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Addressing a Key Gap:** The introduction of directionality in relation extraction is a significant improvement, as understanding the roles of entities is crucial for studying complex biological networks. Existing datasets mostly provide mere relationship annotations without elucidating the nature of these relationships in terms of directionality. 2. **Data Enrichment:** By annotating the BioRED corpus with directionality, the paper not only enhances the dataset's value but also promotes future research by providing a more comprehensive resource for training models that can grasp intricate biological interactions. 3. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of a multi-task language model with soft-prompt learning is a notable contribution that reflects a trend towards more sophisticated and context-aware machine learning models in the biomedical field.  4. **Performance Metrics:** The claimed superior performance of the proposed model against state-of-the-art models adds credibility to its effectiveness and indicates a tangible step forward in relation extraction tasks. **Strengths:** - The paper clearly identifies and tackles a significant limitation within an established framework (BioRED). - The experimental results demonstrate concrete advancements over existing models, likely appealing to researchers in the field. - The availability of annotated data and source code encourages reproducibility and further research. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper presents new annotations and a new model, it may require further validation across a broader set of biomedical texts to establish the generalizability of the model's performance. - There is limited discussion on the potential challenges or limitations when implementing the model in real-world applications or integrating it with existing systems. In conclusion, while the paper presents a commendable advancement in biomedical relation extraction, the broader implications and robustness of the findings require further exploration in diverse biomedical contexts. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yile Gu, Yifan Xiong, Jonathan Mace, Yuting Jiang, Yigong Hu, Baris Kasikci, Peng Cheng
- **Abstract**: Observability in cloud infrastructure is critical for service providers, driving the widespread adoption of anomaly detection systems for monitoring metrics. However, existing systems often struggle to simultaneously achieve explainability, reproducibility, and autonomy, which are three indispensable properties for production use. We introduce Argos, an agentic system for detecting time-series anomalies in cloud infrastructure by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Argos proposes to use explainable and reproducible anomaly rules as intermediate representation and employs LLMs to autonomously generate such rules. The system will efficiently train error-free and accuracy-guaranteed anomaly rules through multiple collaborative agents and deploy the trained rules for low-cost online anomaly detection.

- **Authors**: Wenwen Li, Kangwei Shi, Yidong Chai
- **Abstract**: With the rapid expansion of large language model (LLM) applications, there is an emerging shift in the role of LLM-based AI chatbots from serving merely as general inquiry tools to acting as professional service agents. However, current studies often overlook a critical aspect of professional service agents: the act of communicating in a manner consistent with their professional identities. This is of particular importance in the healthcare sector, where effective communication with patients is essential for achieving professional goals, such as promoting patient well-being by encouraging healthy behaviors. To bridge this gap, we propose LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional Identity), a novel framework for designing professional service agent tailored for medical question-and-answer (Q\&A) services, ensuring alignment with a specific professional identity. Our method includes a theory-guided task planning process that decomposes complex professional tasks into manageable subtasks aligned with professional objectives and a pragmatic entropy method designed to generate professional and ethical responses with low uncertainty. Experiments on various LLMs show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods, including few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, across key metrics such as fluency, naturalness, empathy, patient-centricity, and ROUGE-L scores. Additionally, the ablation study underscores the contribution of each component to the overall effectiveness of the approach.

To address this challenge, the authors propose the LAPI (LLM-based Agent with a Professional Identity) framework, which incorporates a structured task planning approach that breaks down complex tasks into subtasks aligned with professional goals, and a pragmatic entropy method to produce professional, ethical, and low-uncertainty responses. The framework was tested on various LLMs, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods regarding fluency, empathy, and patient-centric communication. An ablation study further validated the importance of each component of the proposed approach. ### Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The paper demonstrates notable novelty by introducing the LAPI framework, which is a significant advancement in the field of AI chatbots, specifically tailored for professional domains like healthcare. The focus on developing a professional identity for these agents is a relatively undiscovered area in existing literature, making this contribution particularly valuable. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The topic addressed is highly pertinent given the growing reliance on AI in healthcare, especially concerning patient interactions. 2. **Methodological Innovation:** The combination of theory-guided task decomposition and pragmatic entropy for generating responses is a promising approach that marks a departure from previous methodologies reliant on generic prompting. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The empirical results that show improved performance across various metrics strengthen the argument for the efficacy of the proposed framework. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generality of Findings:** While promising, the research focuses primarily on healthcare, potentially limiting the framework's applicability across other professional domains where communication is essential. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The proposed framework may present implementation challenges for practitioners, as adopting such a nuanced approach could require significant resources or expertise. 3. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The effectiveness metrics (fluency, empathy, etc.) could be considered somewhat subjective, and additional qualitative evaluation through real-world deployment would have strengthened the findings.

- **Authors**: Saaduddin Mahmud, Dorian Benhamou Goldfajn, Shlomo Zilberstein
- **Abstract**: Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) offer a powerful framework for multi-agent coordination but often rely on labor-intensive, manual problem construction. To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a novel approach to Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) through the introduction of VL-DCOPs, which utilize large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automate the generation of constraints from visual and linguistic inputs. The authors propose a range of agent archetypes for dealing with VL-DCOPs, ranging from neuro-symbolic agents that combine algorithmic decision-making with LFMs, to fully neural agents that rely entirely on LFMs for coordination tasks. The evaluation employs state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) across three unique VL-DCOP tasks, examining the strengths and limitations of each agent archetype. The paper concludes by addressing the implications of this framework for addressing larger, unresolved challenges within the DCOP domain. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper introduces a promising framework, VL-DCOPs, that directs attention toward leveraging LFMs in automating DCOP solutions. This approach is significant as it builds on existing methodologies in multi-agent systems by integrating cutting-edge multimodal AI tools, thus presenting a fresh perspective on the construction and solution of DCOPs. The concept of agent archetypes allows for a nuanced understanding of the various ways LFMs can be utilized within these frameworks. **Significance**: The significance lies in the automation of a traditionally manual process, thus displaying a potential efficiency gain in multi-agent coordination. By evaluating various archetypes, the study paves the way for understanding the trade-offs between reliance on LFM capabilities and control remaining with algorithmic processes. This makes it relevant not only for researchers in the field of AI and multi-agent systems but also for applications where coordination among distributed agents is critical. **Strengths**: 1. The proposed framework is innovative, moving towards an area not extensively covered in the existing literature. 2. The use of multimodal foundation models (LFMs) could lead to substantial advancements in both theory and application. 3. The empirical evaluation across diverse tasks showcases practical implications and provides insight into the operational capabilities of different agent types. **Weaknesses**: 1. The architectural complexity of fully neural agents may introduce challenges in interpretability and debugging, which is crucial when applying AI systems in real-world situations. 2. There may be limitations concerning the scalability of the approach, as the task complexity may grow faster than the capabilities of the LFMs in real-time contexts. 3. The paper might not sufficiently address how the framework can handle edge cases or scenarios where visual and linguistic information conflict. Overall, the paper contributes significantly to the field of multi-agent coordination by bridging traditional optimization problems with modern AI approaches.

### VideoShield: Regulating Diffusion-based Video Generation Models via Watermarking
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14195v1)
- **Authors**: Runyi Hu, Jie Zhang, Yiming Li, Jiwei Li, Qing Guo, Han Qiu, Tianwei Zhang
- **Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has advanced significantly, particularly with the development of video generation models such as text-to-video (T2V) models and image-to-video (I2V) models. However, like other AIGC types, video generation requires robust content control. A common approach is to embed watermarks, but most research has focused on images, with limited attention given to videos. Traditional methods, which embed watermarks frame-by-frame in a post-processing manner, often degrade video quality. In this paper, we propose VideoShield, a novel watermarking framework specifically designed for popular diffusion-based video generation models. Unlike post-processing methods, VideoShield embeds watermarks directly during video generation, eliminating the need for additional training. To ensure video integrity, we introduce a tamper localization feature that can detect changes both temporally (across frames) and spatially (within individual frames). Our method maps watermark bits to template bits, which are then used to generate watermarked noise during the denoising process. Using DDIM Inversion, we can reverse the video to its original watermarked noise, enabling straightforward watermark extraction. Additionally, template bits allow precise detection for potential temporal and spatial modification. Extensive experiments across various video models (both T2V and I2V models) demonstrate that our method effectively extracts watermarks and detects tamper without compromising video quality. Furthermore, we show that this approach is applicable to image generation models, enabling tamper detection in generated images as well. Codes and models are available at \href{https://github.com/hurunyi/VideoShield}{https://github.com/hurunyi/VideoShield}.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "VideoShield: Regulating Diffusion-based Video Generation Models via Watermarking" discusses a novel watermarking framework aimed at enhancing content control in AI-generated videos. As video generation technology, such as text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, advances, ensuring the integrity of generated content becomes increasingly important. While traditional watermarking techniques have focused primarily on images, they often compromise video quality by embedding watermarks frame-by-frame after generation. VideoShield proposes an innovative solution that integrates watermark embedding directly into the video generation process, thus avoiding additional training. The framework includes features for tamper localization, allowing it to detect modifications across time and space within videos. Utilizing DDIM Inversion, the method enables easy extraction of watermarks while maintaining the original video quality. The findings suggest the method is effective in both video and image generation contexts, demonstrating strong performance in watermark extraction and tamper detection. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty (Positive Aspects):** 1. **Focus on Video Generation Models:** This paper addresses a significant gap in research concerning watermarking techniques specific to videos, contrasting with a body of work primarily concentrated on images. 2. **Integration of Watermarking in Generation Process:** By embedding watermarks directly during the video generation process, VideoShield overcomes the limitations of traditional methods that function as post-processing techniques, presenting a more holistic approach to watermarking.  3. **Tamper Localization Feature:** The inclusion of a feature that detects both temporal and spatial alterations adds a layer of sophistication to traditional watermarking techniques, enhancing the robustness of the method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis:** The paper would benefit from a more thorough comparative analysis against existing watermarking techniques. A detailed discussion could reinforce the advantages of using VideoShield over traditional methods. 2. **Generality and Scalability:** While the framework is demonstrated with various video models, it would be informative to clarify if the approach scales effectively to all types of diffusion-based models and whether specific parameters could limit its applicability. 3. **Long-term Viability:** The proposed method's performance against more advanced adversarial techniques in watermark removal or video tampering remains to be extensively examined. **Significance:** VideoShield holds promise in improving the security and integrity of AIGC in video content. The implications for copyright protection and authenticity verification in the vast field of generative AI technology are significant, particularly as these technologies proliferate in media and entertainment sectors. The innovative nature of the integrated watermarking process directly during generation marks a potential shift in how AIGC can be securely managed. Overall, while the paper makes notable contributions to an emerging area of research, the potential limitations and lack of extensive comparative insights slightly diminish its impact.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's clear contribution to video watermarking, addressing existing gaps in research, while emphasizing the need for further validation against competitive techniques and the long-term effectiveness of the proposed framework.

### Serving Long-Context LLMs at the Mobile Edge: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning-based Model Caching and Inference Offloading
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14205v1)
- **Authors**: Minrui Xu, Dusit Niyato, Christopher G. Brinton
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform zero-shot learning on unseen tasks and few-shot learning on complex reasoning tasks. However, resource-limited mobile edge networks struggle to support long-context LLM serving for LLM agents during multi-round interactions with users. Unlike stateless computation offloading and static service offloading in edge computing, optimizing LLM serving at edge servers is challenging because LLMs continuously learn from context which raises accuracy, latency, and resource consumption dynamics. In this paper, we propose a joint model caching and inference offloading framework that utilizes test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) to optimize deployment and execution strategies for long-context LLM serving. In this framework, we analyze the performance convergence and design an optimization problem considering the utilization of context windows in LLMs. Furthermore, the T2DRL algorithm can learn in both the training phase and the testing phase to proactively manage cached models and service requests and adapt to context changes and usage patterns during execution. To further enhance resource allocation efficiency, we propose a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism, which dynamically matches supply and demand while maximizing social welfare. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the T2DRL algorithm can reduce system costs by at least 30% compared to baselines while guaranteeing the performance of LLM agents in real-world perception and reasoning tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a framework aimed at enhancing the deployment and execution of Large Language Models (LLMs) in resource-constrained mobile edge networks, which traditionally struggle with long-context interactions. It proposes a novel approach combining model caching and inference offloading optimized through a test-time deep reinforcement learning (T2DRL) methodology. This method addresses the dynamic nature of LLMs as they learn from context during interactions, thereby improving accuracy and resource efficiency. Additionally, a double Dutch auction (DDA) mechanism is introduced to efficiently allocate resources by matching supply and demand, ultimately maximizing social welfare. Experimental results indicate that the T2DRL algorithm significantly reduces system costs by at least 30% compared to existing approaches while maintaining LLM performance. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper contributes significant insights into the challenges of deploying long-context LLMs in mobile edge environments, particularly addressing both computational efficiency and model accuracy during contextual learning processes. The innovation of applying test-time deep reinforcement learning to optimize model caching and inference offloading represents a novel approach in this domain, particularly in the context of continuous model use and interaction.  Strengths: 1. **Novelty**: The framework utilizes the emerging concept of T2DRL, which is a relevant advancement in real-time model optimization. 2. **Practical Application**: Focus on edge computing aligns with current technological trends where mobile and resource-constrained environments are predominant. 3. **Performance Metrics**: The paper provides quantitative metrics demonstrating cost reductions, which is vital for evaluation. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper addresses long-context LLMs, it does not explore potential trade-offs with models that may not require such extensive contexts. 2. **Generalizability of Results**: The experimental setup may not adequately represent diverse real-world scenarios, which could limit the applicability of findings. 3. **Complexity**: The proposed mechanisms, particularly the DDA, might introduce additional overheads that need further investigation in practical implementations outside of the tested environments. Overall, the paper represents a noteworthy development in the growing field of efficient LLM deployment at the edge. It effectively tackles a relevant issue and could inspire future research in this area, particularly in optimizing resource use in real-world applications. Nonetheless, empirical validation in various contexts and simplifying complexity for practical deployment remain areas to explore further. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to optimizing LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments while acknowledging areas needing further investigation and validation.

- **Authors**: Haowei Lin, Shanda Li, Haotian Ye, Yiming Yang, Stefano Ermon, Yitao Liang, Jianzhu Ma
- **Abstract**: Given an unconditional generative model and a predictor for a target property (e.g., a classifier), the goal of training-free guidance is to generate samples with desirable target properties without additional training. As a highly efficient technique for steering generative models toward flexible outcomes, training-free guidance has gained increasing attention in diffusion models. However, existing methods only handle data in continuous spaces, while many scientific applications involve both continuous and discrete data (referred to as multimodality). Another emerging trend is the growing use of the simple and general flow matching framework in building generative foundation models, where guided generation remains under-explored. To address this, we introduce TFG-Flow, a novel training-free guidance method for multimodal generative flow. TFG-Flow addresses the curse-of-dimensionality while maintaining the property of unbiased sampling in guiding discrete variables. We validate TFG-Flow on four molecular design tasks and show that TFG-Flow has great potential in drug design by generating molecules with desired properties.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces TFG-Flow, a novel approach for training-free guidance in multimodal generative models, particularly in the context of generative flow. While existing training-free guidance techniques primarily focus on continuous data, TFG-Flow uniquely addresses the challenges associated with multimodality, which includes both continuous and discrete variables. The method boasts the ability to mitigate issues related to the curse-of-dimensionality while ensuring unbiased sampling for discrete variables. The authors validate TFG-Flow through experiments on four molecular design tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating drug-like molecules with targeted properties. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:**  TFG-Flow represents a significant advancement in the realm of training-free guidance in generative models, particularly as it addresses the gap in handling multimodal data types. The approach not only builds on the established framework of flow matching but also introduces techniques that cater to both continuous and discrete data, which is crucial in scientific applications, notably in drug design. This dual focus on unbiased sampling and flexibility in generating diverse outcomes showcases a commendable level of innovation. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Gap in the Field:** The approach fills a critical void in current methodologies, as most existing training-free guidance methods are limited to continuous spaces. By extending these techniques to multimodal contexts, TFG-Flow opens doors for broader applications in diverse domains. 2. **Practical Relevance:** The validation of TFG-Flow on molecular design tasks indicates its practical implications in important real-world situations, such as drug discovery, making it significantly relevant to both academia and industry. 3. **Efficiency in Guiding Generative Models:** The ability to guide generative models without additional training enhances the ease of application, which is vital for researchers and practitioners who require swift outcomes. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Experimental Scope:** While the paper showcases applicability in four molecular tasks, a broader range of applications or a detailed comparison against existing multimodal methods could strengthen the argument for the approach's generalizability and robustness. 2. **Absence of Theoretical Foundations:** While the practical merits are highlighted, a more rigorous theoretical analysis of why TFG-Flow effectively overcomes the curse-of-dimensionality in multimodal spaces could enhance the academic rigor of the paper. **Overall Impact:** The introduction of TFG-Flow can potentially shift the landscape of generative modeling in areas that require multimodal data analysis. The implications for drug design are particularly noteworthy, suggesting that this method could enhance the efficiency and efficacy of generating novel compounds with desired traits. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's innovative approach to a pertinent problem within generative modeling, a well-defined contribution to the field, and its undeniable practical applications.

This paper introduces Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which extend NGDBs with three core functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. We identify ten key challenges in realizing Agentic NGDBs: semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and integration with foundation models like large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, Agentic NGDBs can enable intelligent, self-improving systems for modern data-driven applications, paving the way for adaptable and autonomous data management solutions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Top Ten Challenges Towards Agentic Neural Graph Databases" addresses the limitations of traditional graph databases (GDBs) and neural graph databases (NGDBs). While conventional GDBs, such as Neo4j and TigerGraph, perform well with interconnected data, they fall short in advanced inference capabilities.

However, NGDBs face challenges regarding autonomy and adaptability due to their reliance on predefined queries. To solve these issues, the authors propose Agentic Neural Graph Databases (Agentic NGDBs), which introduce three primary functionalities: autonomous query construction, neural query execution, and continuous learning. The paper identifies ten critical challenges in achieving these goals, including effective semantic unit representation, abductive reasoning, scalable query execution, and the integration of large language models (LLMs). By addressing these challenges, the authors argue that Agentic NGDBs could facilitate intelligent and self-improving systems, ultimately transforming data management in dynamic applications. ### Evaluation #### Novelty The concept of Agentic NGDBs presents a novel approach to enhancing the capabilities of NGDBs by introducing an autonomy layer. While the integration of GNNs with database management is a known area of interest, the emphasis on autonomy and the identification of specific challenges reflect a fresh perspective. Moreover, the combination of continuous learning in database management is indeed innovative, pushing the boundaries of current GDB capabilities. #### Significance The proposed enhancements have the potential to significantly influence the fields of database management and machine learning by addressing practical constraints. By integrating reasoning capabilities and adaptability into graph databases, the work responds to modern data demands, where the richness of interlinked information is vital and often faced with issues like data incompleteness and noise. #### Strengths 1. **Identification of Challenges**: The paper does an excellent job of laying out specific challenges that need to be addressed for the successful realization of Agentic NGDBs. This can guide future research directions. 2. **Relevance and Applicability**: Given the surge in connected data applications, the proposed system's adaptive capabilities serve as a timely contribution to the field, promising to evolve with user needs. 3. **Interdisciplinary Integration**: The leveraging of GNNs and LLMs opens up interdisciplinary horizons, fostering collaborations between AI and database research. #### Weaknesses 1. **Lack of Technical Depth**: While challenges are identified, the paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration or preliminary solutions to these challenges, lacking technical depth in proposed methodologies. 2. **Generalizability**: The framework's general applicability across different domains isn't sufficiently examined in the paper. Its effectiveness may vary across different types of data and applications. 3. **Empirical Validation**: Without empirical evidence or case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Agentic NGDBs, claims made in the paper remain somewhat speculative.

### Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14250v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Zhao, Youzhi Zhang
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in real-world applications, raising concerns about their safety and trustworthiness. While red-teaming with jailbreak prompts exposes the vulnerabilities of LLMs, current efforts focus primarily on single-turn attacks, overlooking the multi-turn strategies used by real-world adversaries. Existing multi-turn methods rely on static patterns or predefined logical chains, failing to account for the dynamic strategies during attacks. We propose Siren, a learning-based multi-turn attack framework designed to simulate real-world human jailbreak behaviors. Siren consists of three stages: (1) training set construction utilizing Turn-Level LLM feedback (Turn-MF), (2) post-training attackers with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO), and (3) interactions between the attacking and target LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that Siren achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B as the attacker against Gemini-1.5-Pro as the target model, and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming single-turn baselines. Moreover, Siren with a 7B-scale model achieves performance comparable to a multi-turn baseline that leverages GPT-4o as the attacker, while requiring fewer turns and employing decomposition strategies that are better semantically aligned with attack goals. We hope Siren inspires the development of stronger defenses against advanced multi-turn jailbreak attacks under realistic scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YiyiyiZhao/siren. Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful text.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Siren: A Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Framework for Simulating Real-World Human Jailbreak Behaviors" addresses the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications, focusing on the shortfall of current research which mainly emphasizes single-turn attacks. It posits that real-world adversaries engage in multi-turn attack strategies that manipulate LLMs through dynamic interactions rather than static patterns. Siren, the proposed framework, operates in three stages: (1) constructing a training set that utilizes feedback from Turn-Level LLMs, (2) utilizing supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization for post-training attackers, and (3) facilitating interactive engagements between attacking and target LLMs. Experimental results show a high attack success rate (ASR) of 90% with LLaMA-3-8B against Gemini-1.5-Pro and 70% with Mistral-7B against GPT-4o, outperforming single-turn methods. The framework offers promising approaches by requiring fewer turns and incorporating strategies that align more closely with the objectives of jailbreak attacks, thus showing potential for future developments in defensive measures. ### Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper makes a notable contribution by shifting focus from single-turn attacks, which have dominated prior research, to a more realistic framework of multi-turn interactions. The ability to simulate human-like behaviors in LLM jailbreak scenarios through a learning-based method presents an innovative approach. #### Significance: The implications of Siren are profound. Given the widespread use of LLMs across various applications, understanding and developing frameworks to test their vulnerabilities is crucial. By demonstrating effective multi-turn strategies, Siren not only highlights vulnerabilities but also sets the groundwork for improving defensive tactics against them. #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Framework**: The learning-based approach for simulating multi-turn attacks addresses a significant gap in existing research. 2. **High Success Rates**: The reported success rates of attacks are compelling, indicating effective modeling and implementation. 3. **Realism**: The emphasis on simulating real-world adversarial behavior enhances the practical relevance of the research. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Potential for Misuse**: The research contains warnings about potentially harmful text, raising ethical concerns regarding the dissemination of knowledge that could empower malicious actors. 2. **Generalizability**: The research is contingent upon the architecture of specific models (e.g., LLaMA-3 and Mistral), which may limit generalizability across other architectures or future models. 3. **Lack of Defensive Strategies**: While the paper presents a strong offensive framework, it does not provide corresponding defensive techniques, which limits its utility for practitioners concerned with securing LLMs. In conclusion, the paper presents a substantial advancement in the study of LLM vulnerabilities through multi-turn attack simulations. Nevertheless, the ethical concerns around the research, its potential misuse, and the focus on specific architectures temper its overall impact. Therefore, while the work is indispensable for the field, it may warrant cautious consideration regarding its applications. **Score: 8**

### CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14264v1)
- **Authors**: Xiaojun Tang, Jingru Wang, Guangwei Huang, Guannan Chen, Rui Zheng, Lian Huai, Yuyu Liu, Xingqun Jiang
- **Abstract**: Recent advancements in Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, based on Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models, have significantly improved visual quality. However, they present significant challenges for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), as the existing Full-Reference IQA methods often rate images with high perceptual quality poorly. In this paper, we reassess the Solution Non-Uniqueness and Degradation Indeterminacy issues of BIR, and propose constructing a specific BIR IQA system. In stead of directly comparing a restored image with a reference image, the BIR IQA evaluates fidelity by calculating the Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI). Specifically, we propose a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm, which can acquire the consistency with a degraded image for various types without requiring knowledge of degradation parameters. The supported degradation types include down sampling, blur, noise, JPEG and complex combined degradations etc. In addition, we propose a Reference Agnostic CDI, enabling BIR fidelity evaluation without reference images. Finally, in order to validate the rationality of CDI, we create a new Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluation of BIR fidelity. Experiments conducted on DISDCD verify that CDI is markedly superior to common Full Reference IQA methods for BIR fidelity evaluation. The source code and the DISDCD dataset will be publicly available shortly.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "CDI: Blind Image Restoration Fidelity Evaluation based on Consistency with Degraded Image" addresses the challenges faced in evaluating the fidelity of images restored through Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods, particularly those enhanced by recent advancements such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Diffusion Models. Traditional Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (IQA) techniques fall short, as they do not adequately measure the perceptual quality of restored images. The authors propose a new Image Quality Assessment system that evaluates fidelity through a methodology termed Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI), rather than direct comparisons with reference images. They introduce a wavelet domain Reference Guided CDI algorithm to assess consistency across various degradation types without needing prior knowledge of the degradation parameters. Additionally, they propose a Reference Agnostic CDI method that eliminates the requirement of reference images altogether. To substantiate their method, the authors created a new dataset, the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD), for subjective evaluations, illustrating that their CDI approach significantly outperforms traditional Full Reference IQA methods in assessing BIR fidelity. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several notable contributions to the field of Blind Image Restoration (BIR) and Image Quality Assessment (IQA).  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty:** The introduction of Consistency with Degraded Image (CDI) provides a fresh perspective on assessing BIR quality, a significant improvement over existing methods that rely on direct comparisons with reference images. This shift in approach addresses the critical issues of solution non-uniqueness and degradation indeterminacy inherent in BIR.     2. **Methodological Innovation:** The use of wavelet transformations to assess image consistency indicates a strong grasp of the technical aspects of image processing, and the development of both Reference Guided and Reference Agnostic methods widens the applicability of their approach significantly. 3. **Dataset Creation:** The introduction of the Degraded Images Switch Display Comparison Dataset (DISDCD) for subjective evaluations is a constructive addition to the field, providing resources for performance validation of various methods against a consistent benchmark. 4. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments demonstrate that CDI offers substantial improvements over traditional methods, establishing its effectiveness in real-world applications of BIR. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the proposed CDI method shows superiority over traditional methods, the paper does not adequately discuss its limitations or the conditions under which its performance might degrade. Details regarding the type and extent of image degradations where CDI might fail to provide reliable assessments would strengthen the discussion. 2. **Lack of Extensive Comparative Analysis:** While comparisons with Full Reference methods are made, the paper could benefit from evaluations against other emerging IQA methods, particularly those aligned with deep learning frameworks, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of its positioning in the current landscape. 3. **Subjectivity in Dataset Generation:** As the subjective nature of image quality assessment can vary among evaluators, the methodology for creating DISDCD may introduce biases that should be addressed to reinforce the credibility of the findings. This paper effectively introduces a promising paradigm in the evaluation of BIR fidelity, filling a significant gap in current methods. However, for its impact to reach its full potential, further validation and exploration of its boundaries are necessary. **Score: 8**  Overall, the contributions are substantial and hold the potential to significantly influence both BIR and IQA methodologies, earning a high score due to its innovative approach and practical applications. The weaknesses identified, while notable, do not overshadow the overall merit of the work, thus justifying an 8 rather than a higher score.

- **Authors**: Sadegh Mahdavi, Muchen Li, Kaiwen Liu, Christos Thrampoulidis, Leonid Sigal, Renjie Liao
- **Abstract**: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their ability to solve Olympiad-level math problems. However, the training and evaluation of these models are constrained by the limited size and quality of available datasets, as creating large-scale data for such advanced problems requires extensive effort from human experts. In addition, current benchmarks are prone to contamination, leading to unreliable evaluations. In this paper, we present an automated pipeline that leverages the rich resources of the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum, which predominantly features Olympiad-level problems and community-driven solutions. Using open-source LLMs, we develop a method to extract question-answer pairs from the forum, resulting in AoPS-Instruct, a dataset of more than 600,000 high-quality QA pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs on AoPS-Instruct improves their reasoning abilities across various benchmarks. Moreover, we build an automatic pipeline that introduces LiveAoPSBench, an evolving evaluation set with timestamps, derived from the latest forum data, providing a contamination-resistant benchmark for assessing LLM performance. Notably, we observe a significant decline in LLM performance over time, suggesting their success on older examples may stem from pre-training exposure rather than true reasoning ability. Our work presents a scalable approach to creating and maintaining large-scale, high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning, offering valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in this domain. Our benchmark and code is available at https://github.com/DSL-Lab/aops
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the challenges of training and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on Olympiad-level math problems, which are limited by the quality and size of existing datasets and problems with benchmark contamination. The authors present an automated pipeline utilizing resources from the Art of Problem Solving (AoPS) forum to create AoPS-Instruct, a dataset containing over 600,000 high-quality question-answer pairs. Fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset improves their reasoning abilities. Additionally, they introduce LiveAoPSBench, an evolving benchmark that mitigates contamination through continuous updates from the forum, revealing a decline in LLM performance over time. This indicates that LLMs may rely on prior exposure rather than genuine reasoning skills. Their approach provides a scalable method for developing high-quality datasets for advanced math reasoning and sheds light on LLMs' capabilities and limitations. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the interplay between LLMs and complex mathematical problem-solving. The novelty lies in the utilization of the AoPS forum as a rich resource to create a large dataset specifically focused on Olympiad-level problems, addressing a notable gap in the availability of quality training data. Additionally, the introduction of LiveAoPSBench to counter benchmark contamination offers a progressive step towards more reliable evaluations of LLM performance. However, while the creation of AoPS-Instruct and LiveAoPSBench is commendable, the paper could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons to existing datasets and benchmarks. For instance, a broader evaluation of how their models perform against leads in the same domain would strengthen their claims of improvement. Furthermore, while the analysis of LLMs' performance decay over time is intriguing, additional insights into the underlying causes and potential mitigations would enhance understanding and provide actionable pathways for future research. In conclusion, the paper contributes meaningful resources and insights that could influence future directions in LLM training and evaluation. However, the execution could be enhanced through deeper analyses and comparisons. Given these factors, the paper demonstrates substantial novelty and significance in the field of LLM research and mathematics, but not without its limitations. **Score: 8**

### Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294v1)
- **Authors**: Sullam Jeoung, Yubin Ge, Haohan Wang, Jana Diesner
- **Abstract**: Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them. Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes" investigates the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human intentions, focusing specifically on their political biases. It builds on previous findings that LLMs may reflect political leanings akin to specific political parties but extends this inquiry by examining the conditions and extent of deviations from accurate empirical stances. This study utilizes principles from cognitive science, specifically representativeness heuristics, to evaluate how LLMs may overstate stereotypes related to political positions. Through experimental analysis, the researchers found that LLMs often exaggerate stances more than human respondents and tend to rely excessively on heuristics, leading to misrepresentations and biases in political discourse. The paper also proposes mitigation strategies through prompt adjustments to lessen the influence of these heuristics, demonstrating effectiveness in refining the LLM’s responses. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a novel angle by linking cognitive science concepts to the performance of LLMs in political contexts, specifically through the lens of representativeness heuristics. This interdisciplinary approach is impactful as it sheds light on the mechanisms through which LLMs may perpetuate stereotypes, contributing to the broader discourse on AI alignment with human values.  Despite this, while the utilization of heuristic principles is intriguing, similar vulnerabilities of LLMs have been acknowledged in past studies regarding biases and stereotype reinforcement. Therefore, the novelty comes from the specific focus on political stereotypes rather than general biases, which is a relevant but less explored domain in LLM research. **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The integration of cognitive science findings into the study of political bias in LLMs is a strong feature, allowing for a deeper understanding of underlying mechanisms. 2. **Empirical Evidence:** The paper employs experiments to showcase the exaggeration tendencies of LLMs relative to human judgments, providing robust data for its claims. 3. **Practical Solutions:** The proposed prompt-based mitigation strategies are actionable, offering immediate implications for developers and users of LLMs in political contexts. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Research:** While the paper addresses political stereotypes specifically, the findings may appear limited without considering other potential biases, leading to a broader understanding of LLM behavior. 2. **Generality of Findings:** The study focuses on specific political issues; thus, its findings may not generalize across all areas where LLMs operate, such as social or cultural contexts. 3. **Limited Novelty in Bias Research:** The implications of biases in LLMs have been examined in various contexts. Although the focus on political stereotypes is useful, it risks being perceived as reiteration rather than a groundbreaking advancement in the field. Given these factors, the paper presents significant findings that matter in the contemporary dialogue about AI and ethics, yet it does tread on familiar ground regarding biases without introducing fundamentally new theories. Thus, while its contributions are valuable, they do not signify an exceptional breakthrough. **Score: 7**

### MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14304v1)
- **Authors**: Bingzheng Gan, Yufan Zhao, Tianyi Zhang, Jing Huang, Yusu Li, Shu Xian Teo, Changwang Zhang, Wei Shi
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being explored for problem-solving tasks. However, their strategic planning capability is often viewed with skepticism. Recent studies have incorporated the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to augment the planning capacity of LLM. Despite its potential, MCTS relies on extensive sampling simulations to approximate the true reward distribution, leading to two primary issues. Firstly, MCTS is effective for tasks like the Game of Go, where simulation results can yield objective rewards (e.g., 1 for a win and 0 for a loss). However, for tasks such as question answering, the result of a simulation is the answer to the question, which cannot obtain an objective reward without the ground truth. Secondly, obtaining statistically significant reward estimations typically requires a sample size exceeding 30 simulations, resulting in excessive token usage and time consumption. To address these challenges, we present Multi-Agent System with Tactical Execution and Reasoning using LLM Specialized MCTS (MASTER), a novel framework that coordinates agent recruitment and communication using LLM specialized MCTS. This system autonomously adjusts the number of agents based on task complexity and ensures focused communication among them. Comprehensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. It achieves 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop, setting new state-of-the-art performance on these datasets.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "MASTER: A Multi-Agent System with LLM Specialized MCTS" addresses the limitations of using Large Language Models (LLMs) for strategic planning by integrating them with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. While MCTS enhances the planning abilities of LLMs, it presents challenges, particularly in tasks where objective rewards cannot be easily defined, such as in question answering. The authors propose a new framework called MASTER that dynamically coordinates multiple agents using a specialized version of MCTS. This system adapts the number of agents to the complexity of the task and streamlines their communication, thereby improving the efficiency of the problem-solving process. The effectiveness of MASTER is demonstrated with experiments that yield new state-of-the-art results, achieving 76% accuracy on HotpotQA and 80% on WebShop. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty**: The paper introduces a novel framework that leverages LLMs in conjunction with MCTS in a multi-agent context, which is a relatively unexplored area in the intersection of AI methodologies. By addressing the specific challenges of using MCTS for tasks that lack clear objective rewards, the authors reveal potential improvements in accuracy for complex tasks like question answering. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of LLMs with a coordinated multi-agent structure using MCTS is a significant advancement, potentially transforming how problem-solving tasks are approached within AI. 2. **Experimental Validation**: The authors present comprehensive experimental results, surpassing existing benchmarks which lends credibility to the proposed method's efficacy and applicability. 3. **Adaptability**: The framework’s ability to adjust the number of agents based on task complexity indicates a sophisticated understanding of resource management in AI systems, which can lead to more efficient computations. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Domain Specificity**: The focus on specific datasets (HotpotQA and WebShop) may limit the generalizability of the results. Other tasks not represented in these datasets could yield different results. 2. **Complexity**: The proposed system introduces additional complexity in communication and coordination among agents, which may present implementation challenges or overhead in practice. 3. **Limited Comparative Analysis**: While state-of-the-art performance is claimed, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of existing methodologies beyond just the two highlighted datasets. Overall, "MASTER" shows promise and introduces a compelling framework that could influence future research in multi-agent systems and LLMs for problem-solving tasks. However, the need for broader testing and validation limits its immediate applicability. **Score: 8** This score reflects the significant novelty and promising results presented in the paper, balanced by the limitations in generalizability and complexity that could impact practical implementations.

### PAID: A Framework of Product-Centric Advertising Image Design
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14316v1)
- **Authors**: Hongyu Chen, Min Zhou, Jing Jiang, Jiale Chen, Yang Lu, Bo Xiao, Tiezheng Ge, Bo Zheng
- **Abstract**: In E-commerce platforms, a full advertising image is composed of a background image and marketing taglines. Automatic ad image design reduces human costs and plays a crucial role. For the convenience of users, a novel automatic framework named Product-Centric Advertising Image Design (PAID) is proposed in this work. PAID takes the product foreground image, required taglines, and target size as input and creates an ad image automatically. PAID consists of four sequential stages: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Different expert models are trained to conduct these sub-tasks. A visual language model (VLM) based prompt generation model is leveraged to produce a product-matching background prompt. The layout generation model jointly predicts text and image layout according to the background prompt, product, and taglines to achieve the best harmony. An SDXL-based layout-controlled inpainting model is trained to generate an aesthetic background image. Previous ad image design methods take a background image as input and then predict the layout of taglines, which limits the spatial layout due to fixed image content. Innovatively, our PAID adjusts the stages to produce an unrestricted layout. To complete the PAID framework, we created two high-quality datasets, PITA and PIL. Extensive experimental results show that PAID creates more visually pleasing advertising images than previous methods.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents PAID, an innovative framework for automatic product-centric advertising image design tailored for e-commerce. PAID streamlines the process of ad image creation by integrating four key stages: prompt generation, layout generation, background image generation, and graphics rendering. Unlike previous models that utilize a fixed background as a basis for layout, PAID allows for dynamic styling by using the product and marketing taglines as the primary inputs. It employs a visual language model for prompt generation, ensuring the background harmonizes with the product, while specific models handle layout and aesthetic background creation. The authors also introduce the PITA and PIL datasets to support their framework. Experimental results indicate that PAID outperforms existing methods in generating visually appealing ad images. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: PAID distinguishes itself by moving away from traditional models that impose layout constraints through fixed background images. Instead, it uses the content as the basis for designing an unrestricted layout, which is a significant shift in how advertising images can be generated.    2. **Sequential Model Architecture**: The framework's sequential design leverages specialized models for each design stage, enhancing the coherence and quality of the final output. This modularity is beneficial for targeted optimizations in each component. 3. **High-Quality Datasets**: By creating PITA and PIL, the authors have provided valuable resources for further research and benchmarking in product advertising image generation. 4. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental results showcasing superiority over existing methods add credibility, providing practical evidence of the framework's effectiveness. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the framework offers improvements in certain areas, the paper could elaborate more on limitations or edge cases. For example, how does PAID perform with diverse product types, or does it scale well for bulk ad creation? 2. **Clarity on Generalization**: Although results show better visual appeal, the paper does not extensively discuss how well the proposed methods generalize to various product categories or advertising needs beyond what was tested.  3. **Potential User Adaptation**: The adoption of such models might require user adaptation or design skills that not all e-commerce marketers possess, which could limit practical application in some contexts. 4. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art Approaches**: The paper could benefit from discussions comparing the proposed method directly with a broader range of contemporary approaches and discussing the nuances that PAID addresses. ### Conclusion Overall, PAID presents a novel and impactful contribution to the field of advertising image design, promising advancements that could automate and improve the quality of e-commerce advertising efforts. The sophistication of the framework suggests significant potential for future research and application; however, its practical implications and adaptability could be more thoroughly explored. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and relevance within the field, bolstered by innovative methodology and empirical validation, but tempered by the absence of deeper discussions on generalizability and broader comparative analysis.

### Assessing Large Language Models in Comprehending and Verifying Concurrent Programs across Memory Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14326v1)
- **Authors**: Ridhi Jain, Rahul Purandare
- **Abstract**: As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, to comprehend and analyze concurrency issues in software programming under various memory models. With the growing complexity of concurrent programming, the authors assess the models’ competency in identifying concurrency problems—such as data races and deadlocks—under both sequentially consistent memory models and relaxed memory models like Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO). The evaluation utilizes SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests to measure the models’ performance. Results indicate that while advanced models like GPT-4 and Mistral-AI's Large2 show strong capabilities in understanding concurrency issues under sequentially consistent models, they struggle to verify program correctness under relaxed memory models due to difficulties in capturing memory ordering constraints. This study highlights the models’ limitations in complex concurrency scenarios and emphasizes the need for ongoing research to improve LLM performance in this critical area of software development. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Understanding the Scope:** The paper addresses a significant challenge in the programming field: the verification of concurrent programs, which is crucial as software systems become increasingly multi-threaded. The evaluation of LLMs in this context presents a novel angle, combining advancements in AI with pressing problems in concurrency. 2. **Evaluation Metrics:** The use of established benchmarks like SV-COMP and ARM Litmus tests provides a robust methodology for evaluating the models. This approach gives credibility to the findings and reflects well on the experimental design. 3. **Highlighting Limitations:** The paper does not shy away from discussing the limitations of LLMs, particularly their struggles with relaxed memory models. This critical examination adds to the paper’s value, as it sets the stage for future improvements in model architecture and training. **Strengths:** - The research connects AI and software engineering, striking a timely chord as programming paradigms evolve. - The paper uses rigorous methodologies and relevant test cases for evaluation, leading to meaningful results. **Weaknesses:** - Limited comprehensive exploration of potential solutions or improvements regarding the shortcomings in verifying correctness under relaxed memory models. - The authors could further explore the implications of their findings on wider software development practices and future research avenues. **Potential Influence:** Given the ongoing advancements in AI and the reliance on LLMs for both classical and emergent programming tasks, the paper's findings might influence how these models are integrated into development tools. However, the limitations identified must be addressed to maximize real-world applicability. **Score: 7**  The score of 7 reflects a balance between the innovative integration of LLMs within a critical area of software development and the notable limitations faced in practical applications. While the research is valuable and provides useful insights, the area of relaxed memory models represents a complex challenge that remains unresolved, which detracts from the paper's overall impact.

- **Authors**: Clément Desroches, Martin Chauvin, Louis Ladan, Caroline Vateau, Simon Gosset, Philippe Cordier
- **Abstract**: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has raised concerns regarding its global environmental impact that extends beyond greenhouse gas emissions to include consideration of hardware fabrication and end-of-life processes. The opacity from major providers hinders companies' abilities to evaluate their AI-related environmental impacts and achieve net-zero targets.In this paper, we propose a methodology to estimate the environmental impact of a company's AI portfolio, providing actionable insights without necessitating extensive AI and Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) expertise. Results confirm that large generative AI models consume up to 4600x more energy than traditional models. Our modelling approach, which accounts for increased AI usage, hardware computing efficiency, and changes in electricity mix in line with IPCC scenarios, forecasts AI electricity use up to 2030. Under a high adoption scenario, driven by widespread Generative AI and agents adoption associated to increasingly complex models and frameworks, AI electricity use is projected to rise by a factor of 24.4.Mitigating the environmental impact of Generative AI by 2030 requires coordinated efforts across the AI value chain. Isolated measures in hardware efficiency, model efficiency, or grid improvements alone are insufficient. We advocate for standardized environmental assessment frameworks, greater transparency from the all actors of the value chain and the introduction of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with net-zero goals.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the significant environmental impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights that while AI growth is accelerating, understanding its comprehensive environmental consequences—including energy consumption, hardware production, and end-of-life processes—remains obscure due to a lack of transparency from major AI providers. The authors present a methodology designed to help corporations estimate their AI-related environmental impacts without requiring extensive expertise in AI or Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). Their findings indicate that generative AI models can consume up to 4600 times more energy than traditional models. The study forecasts a dramatic increase in AI electricity use, projecting a rise by a factor of 24.4 by 2030, driven by widespread adoption of generative AI. To mitigate this environmental impact, the authors call for collective actions across the AI value chain, including the establishment of standardized environmental assessments, enhanced transparency, and the creation of a "Return on Environment" metric to align AI development with sustainability goals. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant and timely contribution to the discussion surrounding the environmental sustainability of AI technologies.

### GraphBC: Improving LLMs for Better Graph Data Processing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14427v1)
- **Authors**: Xu Chu, Hanlin Xue, Zhijie Tan, Bingce Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li
- **Abstract**: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains has led researchers to apply them to graph-related problems by converting graph data into natural language text. However, unlike graph data, natural language inherently has sequential order. We observe that when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language description of a graph is shuffled, despite describing the same graph, model performance fluctuates between high performance and random guessing. Additionally, due to the limited input context length of LLMs, current methods typically randomly sample neighbors of target nodes as representatives of their neighborhood, which may not always be effective for accurate reasoning. To address these gaps, we introduce GraphBC. This novel model framework features an Order Selector Module to ensure proper serialization order of the graph and a Subgraph Sampling Module to sample subgraphs with better structure for better reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Graph CoT obtained through distillation, and enhance LLM's reasoning and zero-shot learning capabilities for graph tasks through instruction tuning. Experiments on multiple datasets for node classification and graph question-answering demonstrate that GraphBC improves LLMs' performance and generalization ability on graph tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "GraphBC: Improving LLMs for Better Graph Data Processing" focuses on enhancing the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in processing graph data, which is often converted into natural language for analysis. The authors highlight a critical issue: the performance of LLMs varies significantly when the order of nodes or edges in the natural language representation is altered. They argue that current methods inadequately represent the context of graph structures due to the random sampling of neighbors, which can lead to inefficient reasoning. To tackle these challenges, the authors introduce GraphBC, a model framework that includes an Order Selector Module to maintain the correct serialization of graph elements and a Subgraph Sampling Module to select more structurally informative subgraphs. They also propose a distilled version of their model, referred to as Graph CoT, alongside techniques for instruction tuning to improve LLM reasoning capabilities in graph-related tasks. Experimental results show that GraphBC significantly enhances performance on benchmarks for node classification and graph question-answering, suggesting improvements in both performance and generalization in LLMs applied to graph data. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty GraphBC presents an interesting and innovative approach to addressing the limitations of using LLMs for graph processing. By focusing on both order preservation in graph representation and effective structural sampling, it provides a unique perspective that extends the applicability of LLMs beyond typical sequential data. The introduction of Graph CoT further amplifies its novelty by enhancing reasoning capabilities through distillation and instruction tuning. However, it is important to recognize that while the integration of these modules is valuable, the paper does not extensively compare its methods to existing models in the field other than highlighting their limitations. This raises concerns about whether these contributions are as groundbreaking as claimed or if they simply serve as refinements of existing techniques. #### Significance The significance of this work lies in its potential to improve LLM applications in graph data processing, which remains a challenging area. By tackling fundamental issues like serialization and representative sampling, GraphBC could lead to more reliable and impactful implementations of LLMs in various graph-related applications, including social networks, biological data analysis, and knowledge representation. #### Strengths - The development of the Order Selector and Subgraph Sampling Modules represents a nuanced understanding of graph data processing. - Empirical results demonstrating improvements on node classification and graph QA tasks provide solid backing for the claims made. - The model addresses key limitations of current practices, enhancing the discourse on LLM applications. #### Weaknesses - The paper could benefit from a more thorough comparison against state-of-the-art methods. - Limited insights into how GraphBC scales with larger graphs or more complex tasks could temper perceptions of its applicability. - While the proposed model is novel, it may not fully address all intricacies involved in processing graph data, which could be explored in further research. ### Conclusion Overall, GraphBC represents a meaningful contribution to the intersection of LLMs and graph data processing. It introduces significant improvements that could influence future research and applications in this area. However, the extent of its novelty and impact could be better substantiated with broader comparisons and insights.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects GraphBC’s strong potential and innovative approaches while acknowledging areas for enhancement and further substantiation within the field.

### Domaino1s: Guiding LLM Reasoning for Explainable Answers in High-Stakes Domains
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14431v1)
- **Authors**: Xu Chu, Zhijie Tan, Hanlin Xue, Guanyu Wang, Tong Mo, Weiping Li
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied to downstream domains. However, current LLMs for high-stakes domain tasks, such as financial investment and legal QA, typically generate brief answers without reasoning processes and explanations. This limits users' confidence in making decisions based on their responses. While original CoT shows promise, it lacks self-correction mechanisms during reasoning. This work introduces Domain$o1$s, which enhances LLMs' reasoning capabilities on domain tasks through supervised fine-tuning and tree search. We construct CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k datasets for fine-tuning models that activate domain-specific reasoning steps based on their judgment. Additionally, we propose Selective Tree Exploration to spontaneously explore solution spaces and sample optimal reasoning paths to improve performance. We also introduce PROOF-Score, a new metric for evaluating domain models' explainability, complementing traditional accuracy metrics with richer assessment dimensions. Extensive experiments on stock investment recommendation and legal reasoning QA tasks demonstrate Domaino1s's leading performance and explainability. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Domaino1s-006F/.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Domaino1s: Guiding LLM Reasoning for Explainable Answers in High-Stakes Domains" addresses the challenge of generating explainable and reasoned responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes areas such as finance and legal queries. Current LLMs tend to produce succinct answers without providing the underlying reasoning, potentially undermining users' trust in those decisions. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the authors propose a novel approach called Domaino1s, which combines supervised fine-tuning and a tree search methodology. This method is supported by the creation of domain-specific datasets (CoT-stock-2k and CoT-legal-2k) that facilitate the activation of logical reasoning steps tailored to specific domains. The authors also introduce Selective Tree Exploration for optimizing reasoning paths within the problem space, as well as a new evaluation metric, PROOF-Score, which enriches the assessment of model explainability beyond standard accuracy metrics. The results indicate that Domaino1s outperforms existing models in both stock investment recommendations and legal question answering tasks while providing clearer rationale for decisions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of the paper lies in its focus on high-stakes decision-making domains, expanding on existing CoT methods by integrating self-correction capabilities through their proposed tree search approach and selective exploration. The introduction of domain-specific datasets for fine-tuning is also significant, as it prepares models to better engage with the nuances of complex subject matter. **Strengths:** 1. **Well-defined Problem:** The paper identifies a pertinent issue within LLM applications, particularly in sectors where decision-making carries substantial risk and implications. 2. **Innovative Solutions:** The methods proposed, such as Selective Tree Exploration and PROOF-Score, offer practical advancements aimed at enhancing the reasoning quality and explainability of LLM outputs. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that the method improves model performance on benchmark tasks in high-stakes domains. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Potential Overfitting:** The reliance on carefully constructed datasets may limit the models' generalizability to out-of-sample, real-world cases. 2. **Complexity in Implementation:** Combining supervised fine-tuning with tree search methods adds a layer of complexity that may not be easily adopted by all practitioners. 3. **Evaluation Limitations:** While PROOF-Score aims to capture explainability, the paper does not sufficiently address the subjective nature of explainability itself; what constitutes a “good” explanation may vary significantly among users. **Potential Influences:** This work has the potential to influence both academic research and practical applications in areas requiring robust decision support systems. By highlighting the importance of explainability in LLM outputs, it paves the way for future advancements in building user-trust-based AI systems. ### Score After weighing the strengths against the weaknesses and considering the paper's contributions to the advancement of explainable AI in critical applications, I assign the paper a **Score: 8**.

### Understanding and Mitigating Gender Bias in LLMs via Interpretable Neuron Editing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14457v1)
- **Authors**: Zeping Yu, Sophia Ananiadou
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, posing challenges for their safe deployment. Existing methods to mitigate bias lack a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms or compromise the model's core capabilities. To address these issues, we propose the CommonWords dataset, to systematically evaluate gender bias in LLMs. Our analysis reveals pervasive bias across models and identifies specific neuron circuits, including gender neurons and general neurons, responsible for this behavior. Notably, editing even a small number of general neurons can disrupt the model's overall capabilities due to hierarchical neuron interactions. Based on these insights, we propose an interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based strategies to selectively target biased neurons. Experiments on five LLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces gender bias while preserving the model's original capabilities, outperforming existing fine-tuning and editing approaches. Our findings contribute a novel dataset, a detailed analysis of bias mechanisms, and a practical solution for mitigating gender bias in LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Understanding and Mitigating Gender Bias in LLMs via Interpretable Neuron Editing" addresses significant gender bias prevalent in large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce the CommonWords dataset to evaluate gender bias systematically and uncover specific neuron circuits, including gender and general neurons, contributing to this bias. The research highlights that modifying even a few general neurons can disrupt model performance due to their interconnected nature. To counteract this, the authors propose a novel interpretable neuron editing method that combines logit-based and causal-based approaches to selectively target biased neurons while maintaining the model's capabilities. Experimental results indicate that this method effectively reduces gender bias in five LLMs and outperforms traditional fine-tuning and editing methods. The study contributes both a new dataset and a nuanced understanding of bias mechanisms in LLMs, along with effective strategies for mitigation. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper's primary contributions lie in the introduction of the CommonWords dataset and the novel method for interpretative neuron editing. The systematic evaluation of gender bias provides much-needed empirical evidence and clarifies how specific neuron circuits contribute to this issue, which is an important step forward in the field of natural language processing. The authors' approach to tackle bias without compromising the performance of LLMs is particularly noteworthy and addresses a critical challenge in deploying these systems safely. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensive Approach**: The dual focus on creating a dataset and the methodology to mitigate bias offers a holistic framework for understanding and addressing gender bias in LLMs. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The experimental validation across five different LLMs adds robustness to their findings, suggesting the generalizability of their method. 3. **Interdisciplinary Insight**: The integration of causal inference and logit-based approaches showcases an innovative intersection of methods that can inspire future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Beyond Gender Bias**: While the focus is appropriately on gender bias, the paper does not address how the method might adapt to other forms of bias (e.g., racial or cultural) which limits its scope. 2. **Complexity in Implementation**: The proposed neuron editing method may present challenges in practicality and computational efficiency, which could hinder its application in real-world scenarios. 3. **Lack of Longitudinal Studies**: The paper does not include long-term evaluation of the edited models to assess if bias reduction persists over time or with updates to the models. ### Conclusion The paper presents a significant advancement in understanding and mitigating gender bias in LLMs through a novel dataset and interpretive methodology. While it excels in empirical analysis and innovation, the limitations in scope concerning other biases and potential practical complications are notable. Nonetheless, the contribution to both academic and practical realms in AI ethics and bias mitigation is substantial. **Score: 8**

Traditional methods for boundary value test input generation can be time-consuming and may struggle to address all potential error cases effectively, especially in systems with intricate or highly variable boundaries. This paper presents a framework for assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in generating boundary value test inputs for white-box software testing by examining their potential through prompt engineering. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-based test input generation by analyzing fault detection rates and test coverage, comparing these LLM-generated test sets with those produced using traditional boundary value analysis methods. Our analysis shows the strengths and limitations of LLMs in boundary value generation, particularly in detecting common boundary-related issues. However, they still face challenges in certain areas, especially when handling complex or less common test inputs. This research provides insights into the role of LLMs in boundary value testing, underscoring both their potential and areas for improvement in automated testing methods.

- **Abstract**: Critiques are important for enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling both self-improvement and constructive feedback for others by identifying flaws and suggesting improvements. However, evaluating the critique capabilities of LLMs presents a significant challenge due to the open-ended nature of the task. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark designed to assess the critique capabilities of LLMs. Unlike existing benchmarks, which typically function in an open-loop fashion, our approach employs a closed-loop methodology that evaluates the quality of corrections generated from critiques. Moreover, the benchmark incorporates features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, which are crucial for distinguishing the abilities of advanced reasoning models from more classical ones. We implement this benchmark using eight challenging reasoning tasks. We have several interesting findings. First, despite demonstrating comparable performance in direct chain-of-thought generation, classical LLMs significantly lag behind the advanced reasoning-based model o1-mini across all critique scenarios. Second, in self-critique and iterative critique settings, classical LLMs may even underperform relative to their baseline capabilities. We hope that this benchmark will serve as a valuable resource to guide future advancements. The code and data are available at \url{https://github.com/tangzhy/RealCritic}.

This benchmark includes innovative features such as self-critique, cross-critique, and iterative critique, distinguishing advanced reasoning models from classical ones. Through testing on eight complex reasoning tasks, the findings suggest that classical LLMs underperform compared to advanced models like o1-mini in critique scenarios, showing weaknesses especially in self-critique and iterative critiques. The authors hope that the benchmark will guide future advancements in LLM critique capabilities, and the accompanying code and data are available online. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Benchmarking Approach:** The closed-loop methodology is a significant advancement over traditional open-loop evaluation, as it provides a more direct means to assess the practical outcomes of critiques produced by LLMs. 2. **Comprehensive Features:** The inclusion of various critique forms (self, cross, and iterative) adds depth and versatility to the evaluation process, making the benchmark applicable across different contexts and use cases. 3. **Identification of Model Limitations:** The results revealing that classical LLMs fall short in critique scenarios provide essential insights into their limitations, prompting further investigation into their capabilities and areas for improvement. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Broad Applicability:** While the benchmark is well-constructed, its effectiveness remains to be validated across a broader range of LLMs beyond the ones tested (i.e., o1-mini and classical models). This might limit the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Potential Overfitting to Tasks:** The benchmarking tasks may not cover the full spectrum of possible critique scenarios; hence, while the results are insightful, they risk being narrowly focused on specific contexts or reasoning types. **Conclusion:**  Overall, the paper introduces a valuable tool for the evaluation of LLM critiques, highlighting significant differences in the critique capabilities of different models.

- **Authors**: Jie He, Yijun Yang, Wanqiu Long, Deyi Xiong, Victor Gutierrez Basulto, Jeff Z. Pan
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense potential across various tasks. However, research for exploring and improving the capabilities of LLMs in interpreting graph structures remains limited. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of prompting current open-source LLMs on graph-to-text generation tasks. Although we explored the optimal prompting strategies and proposed a novel and effective diversity-difficulty-based few-shot sample selection method, we found that the improvements from tuning-free approaches were incremental, as LLMs struggle with planning on complex graphs, particularly those with a larger number of triplets. To further improve LLMs in planning with graph sequences and grounding in truth, we introduce a new graph-to-text dataset, PlanGTG, annotated with two sub-tasks: reordering and attribution. Through extensive automatic and human evaluations, we demonstrate significant improvements in the quality of generated text from both few-shot learning and fine-tuning perspectives using the PlanGTG dataset. Our study paves the way for new research directions in graph-to-text generation. PlanGTG datasets can be found in https://github.com/probe2/kg_text.

Despite their efforts, they find that improvements in tuning-free approaches are only incremental, particularly when applied to complex graphs with multiple triplets.  To address the shortcomings, the authors introduce the PlanGTG dataset, which includes graph-to-text pairs annotated with two sub-tasks: reordering and attribution. Their results from extensive evaluations demonstrate substantial enhancements in text generation quality through few-shot learning and fine-tuning when utilizing the PlanGTG dataset. The study opens avenues for further research in the graph-to-text domain, making the PlanGTG dataset publicly accessible. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper contributes to a relatively underexplored area of LLM capabilities—graph-to-text generation. By specifically addressing the challenges associated with planning and interpreting complex graphs, the authors bring important insights into a niche that requires further exploration. The introduction of the PlanGTG dataset is a noteworthy advancement that enhances the field. **Significance**: The significance of the findings is twofold. Firstly, the rigorous evaluation of prompting strategies provides practical insights into optimizing LLM performance on graph-related tasks. Secondly, the creation of a specialized dataset allows subsequent research to build upon a more robust foundation, potentially influencing future methodologies in this area. **Strengths**: - The paper effectively highlights the challenges LLMs face with complex graph structures, providing a useful diagnostic for future researchers. - The comprehensive evaluation strategy, including both automatic and human assessments, lends credibility to the findings. - The novel dataset (PlanGTG) is likely to be a valuable resource for ongoing research, furthering the applicability of LLMs in graph-to-text generation tasks. **Weaknesses**: - While the paper presents incremental improvements, the lack of transformative enhancements from tuning-free approaches might lead to questions about the practical applicability of their findings. - The dependence on a specific dataset may limit generalizability and could benefit from additional validation across diverse graph structures and contexts.

- **Authors**: Pavlin G. Poličar, Martin Špendl, Tomaž Curk, Blaž Zupan
- **Abstract**: Providing students with individualized feedback through assignments is a cornerstone of education that supports their learning and development. Studies have shown that timely, high-quality feedback plays a critical role in improving learning outcomes. However, providing personalized feedback on a large scale in classes with large numbers of students is often impractical due to the significant time and effort required. Recent advances in natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by enabling the efficient delivery of personalized feedback. These technologies can reduce the workload of course staff while improving student satisfaction and learning outcomes. Their successful implementation, however, requires thorough evaluation and validation in real classrooms. We present the results of a practical evaluation of LLM-based graders for written assignments in the 2024/25 iteration of the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana. Over the course of the semester, more than 100 students answered 36 text-based questions, most of which were automatically graded using LLMs. In a blind study, students received feedback from both LLMs and human teaching assistants without knowing the source, and later rated the quality of the feedback. We conducted a systematic evaluation of six commercial and open-source LLMs and compared their grading performance with human teaching assistants. Our results show that with well-designed prompts, LLMs can achieve grading accuracy and feedback quality comparable to human graders. Our results also suggest that open-source LLMs perform as well as commercial LLMs, allowing schools to implement their own grading systems while maintaining privacy.

It highlights the challenge of providing individualized feedback to a large number of students, due to the high demands on time and resources. The authors conducted an empirical study within the Introduction to Bioinformatics course at the University of Ljubljana, where over 100 students engaged with 36 text-based questions graded by LLMs alongside human teaching assistants. In a blind comparison, students assessed the quality of feedback from both sources. The results indicated that, with appropriate prompting, certain LLMs could match human graders in accuracy and feedback quality. The study found that open-source LLMs performed equally well compared to commercial options, suggesting that they can be employed without compromising privacy. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:**  This paper presents significant findings regarding the applicability of large language models in the educational domain, specifically in automated grading systems. The investigation into both commercial and open-source models, coupled with a blind study design, adds novelty to the existing literature. While there has been prior research on LLMs and their potential in education, the direct comparison with human grading practices in a real classroom environment and the demonstration of effective feedback delivery provide fresh insights.  **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Implementation:** The paper's focus on real-world application in a university course enhances its relevance to educators seeking scalable solutions for assignment grading. 2. **Comparative Analysis:** By evaluating both commercial and open-source LLMs, the study contributes to discussions on accessibility and privacy, making it beneficial for institutions considering adopting such technologies. 3. **Data-Driven Approach:** The systematic evaluation utilizing student feedback provides quantitative backing to the claims made about LLM performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** The study focuses on a single course within one academic institution, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further research could expand this to diverse educational settings and disciplines. 2. **Potential Bias in Feedback Perception:** Although the study was blind, underlying biases regarding human versus machine feedback could still influence student ratings.  3. **Long-term Effects Unexplored:** The study does not address the long-term impact of LLM feedback on student learning outcomes, an important aspect of educational interventions that merit evaluation. **Influence on the Field:** This paper has the potential to influence educational practices by demonstrating the viability of integrating AI into grading systems. As educators increasingly seek efficiency and scalability in assessment, studies like this could catalyze further interest and development in automated feedback mechanisms. However, wider acceptance may depend on additional research validating these findings across varied contexts. **Conclusion:** In light of its rigorous empirical methodology, relevance to pressing educational challenges, and contributions to the discourse on AI in academia, the paper merits a score of 8.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14520v1)
- **Authors**: Zhe Xiang, Fei Yu, Quan Deng, Yuandi Li, Zhiguo Wan
- **Abstract**: As communication systems transition from symbol transmission to conveying meaningful information, sixth-generation (6G) networks emphasize semantic communication. This approach prioritizes high-level semantic information, improving robustness and reducing redundancy across modalities like text, speech, and images. However, traditional semantic communication faces limitations, including static coding strategies, poor generalization, and reliance on task-specific knowledge bases that hinder adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel system combining scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding, named \textbf{OpenSC}. Traditional systems rely on fixed domain-specific knowledge bases, limiting their ability to generalize. Our open channel coding approach leverages shared, publicly available knowledge, enabling flexible, adaptive encoding. This dynamic system reduces reliance on static task-specific data, enhancing adaptability across diverse tasks and environments. Additionally, we use scene graphs for structured semantic encoding, capturing object relationships and context to improve tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). Our approach selectively encodes key semantic elements, minimizing redundancy and improving transmission efficiency. Experimental results show significant improvements in both semantic understanding and efficiency, advancing the potential of adaptive, generalizable semantic communication in 6G networks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper proposes OpenSC, a novel semantic communication system designed for sixth-generation (6G) networks that combines scene understanding, Large Language Models (LLMs), and open channel coding. As traditional semantic communication methods face challenges such as static coding strategies and poor adaptability, OpenSC aims to overcome these limitations by utilizing publicly available knowledge and employing scene graphs for structured semantic encoding. This dynamic approach enhances adaptability and reduces redundancy in communicating high-level semantic information across various modalities, including text, speech, and images. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenSC improves both semantic understanding and communication efficiency, promising greater generalizability and effectiveness in 6G environments. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The integration of scene understanding and LLMs into semantic communication represents a notable advancement over traditional methods, which are often limited to static and domain-specific frameworks. 2. **Adaptability**: By using open channel coding and publicly available knowledge bases, the paper addresses significant limitations in generalizability and adaptability, which are crucial for evolving communication systems. 3. **Efficiency**: The focus on reducing redundancy through scene graphs and selective semantic encoding enhances the efficiency of information transmission, a critical factor in the deployment of 6G applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Assumption of Context**: The reliance on scene graphs assumes the availability of structured data, which may not always be practically accessible or applicable in all contexts, thus limiting the system's scalability in diverse, unstructured environments. 2. **Experimental Validation**: While the paper claims significant improvements, the summary lacks detailed discussions on the experimental methodologies used, participant diversity, and the reproducibility of results, which are essential for assessing the robustness of the findings. 3. **Theoretical Limitations**: The paper does not sufficiently explore potential theroretical limitations or contradictions with existing semantic communication literature, which might provide a clearer position of OpenSC within the broader academic conversation. **Significance in the Field:** The paper contributes to the field of communication by addressing critical issues in semantic communication, specifically within the context of emerging technology like 6G. Its focus on scene understanding and leveraging open resources can have a lasting impact on future communication strategies, enabling more dynamic and intelligent systems. **Overall Score: 8** The paper represents a strong contribution to the field of semantic communication, showcasing innovation in approach and practical implications. However, it reflects some limitations in experimental design and theory which hinder its potential impact. Therefore, while it offers valuable insights and advancements, it would benefit from deeper exploration of its assumptions and a more robust validation of its findings.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14524v1)
- **Authors**: Ludovica Schaerf, Andrea Alfarano, Fabrizio Silvestri, Leonardo Impett
- **Abstract**: Despite significant recent advances in image generation with diffusion models, their internal latent representations remain poorly understood. Existing works focus on the bottleneck layer (h-space) of Stable Diffusion's U-Net or leverage the cross-attention, self-attention, or decoding layers. Our model, SkipInject takes advantage of U-Net's skip connections. We conduct thorough analyses on the role of the skip connections and find that the residual connections passed by the third encoder block carry most of the spatial information of the reconstructed image, splitting the content from the style. We show that injecting the representations from this block can be used for text-based editing, precise modifications, and style transfer. We compare our methods state-of-the-art style transfer and image editing methods and demonstrate that our method obtains the best content alignment and optimal structural preservation tradeoff.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Training-Free Style and Content Transfer by Leveraging U-Net Skip Connections in Stable Diffusion 2" introduces a novel approach named SkipInject, which focuses on utilizing the skip connections in the U-Net architecture of Stable Diffusion for style and content transfer. The authors analyze U-Net’s skip connections, particularly noting that the connections from the third encoder block contain significant spatial information, effectively separating content from style. They demonstrate that by injecting representations from this block, they can achieve text-based editing and style transfer. Through comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, the authors claim their approach leads to superior content alignment and structural preservation. **Evaluation:** This paper presents a notable contribution by shifting the focus from widely studied components of diffusion models to the under-explored U-Net skip connections. By highlighting the importance of these connections for separating content and style effectively, it provides a fresh perspective that could inspire further research in the field. Additionally, its approach of being "training-free" can be extremely beneficial for practitioners looking to apply diffusion models without the overhead of additional training. However, the novelty is somewhat hampered by the fact that leveraging skip connections is a well-known technique in deep learning, especially in segmentation tasks. The paper does not extensively explore how SkipInject compares in various scenarios with other methodologies, which leaves room for further validation of its claimed advantages. Moreover, while the results appear promising, the extent of experimental evaluations and comparative analysis with existing methods should be more detailed to fully ascertain the claims made. It would also be beneficial to have a more thorough discussion around potential limitations or scenarios where SkipInject may not perform as efficiently. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the ongoing advancement of style transfer and content editing in image generation. Its emphasis on a less-explored area of U-Net's architecture may spur additional innovations, although more rigorous validation of results would strengthen its impact. Score: 7

### Extracting Problem Structure with LLMs for Optimized SAT Local Search
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14630v1)
- **Authors**: André Schilder, Stefan Szeider
- **Abstract**: Local search preprocessing makes Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers faster by providing high-quality starting points and modern SAT solvers have incorporated this technique into their preprocessing steps. However, these tools rely on basic strategies that miss the structural patterns in problems. We present a method that applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code. This reveals hidden structural patterns in how problems convert into SAT. Our method automatically generates specialized local search algorithms that find these patterns and use them to create strong initial assignments. This works for any problem instance from the same encoding type. Our tests show encouraging results, achieving faster solving times compared to baseline preprocessing systems.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze Python-based encoding code for SAT problems. By identifying hidden structural patterns in the encoding of problems, the authors develop specialized local search algorithms. This technique is designed to enhance local search preprocessing in Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) solvers, providing high-quality starting points and resulting in faster solving times compared to traditional preprocessing methods. Tests demonstrate improved performance for various problem instances. **Critical Evaluation:** The innovation in this paper lies in the application of LLMs to the realm of SAT problem-solving, an area that traditionally relies on more straightforward heuristic strategies for preprocessing. By leveraging advanced language models, the authors claim to uncover structural patterns that other methods overlook. This aspect of the research is noteworthy, as it hints at a broader applicability of machine learning techniques in computer science domains that utilize complex encoding structures. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Novel Application**: Introducing LLMs in SAT solvers is a fresh perspective that may inspire further research into AI-assisted optimization techniques. 2. **Performance Improvement**: Empirical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing preprocessing systems, which could lead to practical benefits in computational efficiency. 3. **Generalizability**: The approach is designed to work with any problem instance of the same encoding type, suggesting a wider reach of applicability. However, there are also weaknesses to consider: 1. **Scope of Testing**: While the results are promising, the paper may not provide an exhaustive comparison with all existing methodologies. Without a broader benchmarking, it is difficult to assess the relative impact fully. 2. **Complexity and Interpretability**: Utilizing LLMs introduces a level of complexity that may hinder the interpretability of the results. Stakeholders may find it challenging to understand how the LLM-derived patterns translate into practical algorithmic decisions. 3. **Dependency on Coding Standards**: The reliance on well-structured Python encoding limits applicability if practitioners use disparate or non-standard encodings, which are common in practice. Considering these factors, the novelty and significance of the work encourage a moderately high score.

### Recommending Actionable Strategies: A Semantic Approach to Integrating Analytical Frameworks with Decision Heuristics
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14634v1)
- **Authors**: Renato Ghisellini, Remo Pareschi, Marco Pedroni, Giovanni Battista Raggi
- **Abstract**: We present a novel approach for recommending actionable strategies by integrating strategic frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. While strategy frameworks provide systematic models for assessment and planning, and decision heuristics encode experiential knowledge,these traditions have historically remained separate. Our methodology bridges this gap using advanced natural language processing (NLP), demonstrated through integrating frameworks like the 6C model with the Thirty-Six Stratagems. The approach employs vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to map framework parameters to heuristic patterns, supported by a computational architecture that combines deep semantic processing with constrained use of Large Language Models. By processing both primary content and secondary elements (diagrams, matrices) as complementary linguistic representations, we demonstrate effectiveness through corporate strategy case studies. The methodology generalizes to various analytical frameworks and heuristic sets, culminating in a plug-and-play architecture for generating recommender systems that enable cohesive integration of strategic frameworks and decision heuristics into actionable guidance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces an innovative methodology for recommending actionable strategies by merging strategic analytical frameworks with decision heuristics through semantic analysis. Traditionally considered separate domains, strategic frameworks (like the 6C model) and decision heuristics (like the Thirty-Six Stratagems) are synthesized using advanced natural language processing techniques. The authors utilize vector space representations and semantic similarity calculations to align framework parameters with heuristic patterns. This process is supported by a unique computational architecture that melds deep semantic processing with a unique application of Large Language Models. The integration goes beyond text to include secondary content such as diagrams and matrices, validated through corporate strategy case studies. The proposed plug-and-play architecture demonstrates versatility, suggesting that it can be applied to various frameworks and heuristics, thereby providing comprehensive recommendations for strategic decision-making. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to tackling the longstanding challenge of integrating structured strategic frameworks with intuitive decision heuristics. Historically, these two areas have been viewed as separate, and this paper successfully bridges that gap using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. The systematic mapping of frameworks to heuristics through semantic similarity is particularly noteworthy; however, the reliance on deep semantic processing raises questions about its practical application and accessibility for users without advanced technical expertise. Strengths of the paper include its interdisciplinary approach, innovative integration, and clear demonstration through case studies, which can significantly benefit practitioners involved in strategic planning. However, the paper does not sufficiently address the limitations and potential biases associated with the chosen NLP methods, nor does it explore the implications of its findings on existing theoretical frameworks. The paper's potential influence on the field could be substantial, especially in fields such as business strategy and organizational behavior, where decision-making processes are critical. However, without extensive empirical validation across different contexts—beyond the corporate strategy cases presented—it is difficult to gauge the scalability and adaptability of the proposed methodology. Overall, while the authors present a compelling vision for improving strategic decision-making through a novel approach, important questions about applicability and limitations need further exploration. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative aspects and its potential to influence strategic decision-making processes while acknowledging the need for deeper exploration of its practical applications and empirical validation in diverse scenarios.

### Towards Scalable Topological Regularizers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14641v1)
- **Authors**: Hiu-Tung Wong, Darrick Lee, Hong Yan
- **Abstract**: Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper addresses the challenge of latent space matching by proposing a scalable topological regularization method that leverages persistent homology. While existing metrics such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy often fall short due to their computational expense and inadequate consideration of geometric and topological properties, the authors introduce principal persistence measures computed from small subsamples to improve efficiency. Their methods include a parallelized GPU implementation to enable larger scale computations and demonstrate stable gradient behaviors for smooth probability densities. The paper showcases its practical implications in various tasks, including shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning, thereby highlighting its potential as a scalable approach to embed topological features in machine learning processes. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the field of topological regularization within machine learning, particularly addressing the computational limitations inherent in using persistent homology directly. The introduction of principal persistence measures is innovative, resolving issues around gradient continuity and enabling the application of topological analysis on a larger scale, which is a notable contribution. The implementation on GPU adds to the practical value, demonstrating that the proposed method can be applied to real-world problems effectively. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Approach:** The use of principal persistence measures to create effective topological regularizers is a new and relevant contribution. 2. **Diverse Applications:** Testing the proposed method on multiple tasks illustrates its versatility and practical implications, enhancing its relevance for various fields including adversarial machine learning and generative modelling. 3. **Technical Rigor:** A thorough GPU-optimized implementation shows both technical skill and the ability to address scalability issues, an important concern in modern machine learning applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Comparison with Prior Art:** The discussion of existing topological methods could be more thorough, potentially underscoring the uniqueness and advantages of the new approach in comparison to prior works. 2. **Specificity of Results:** While the results across different tasks are promising, additional quantitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the case for its superiority. 3. **Dependency on Subsampling:** The reliance on small subsamples for computation might raise questions regarding loss of information from larger datasets, which could be a limitation in certain applications. Overall, the contributions presented in the paper make it a valuable read for researchers in machine learning, particularly in the intersection with topology. The potential for impactful applications, coupled with the innovative technical approach, leads to a strong assessment of the paper's significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a robust contribution with potential for notable influence in the field, while acknowledging some shortcomings that could be addressed in future work for wider acceptance and application.

### Investigating the (De)Composition Capabilities of Large Language Models in Natural-to-Formal Language Conversion
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14649v1)
- **Authors**: Ziyao Xu, Houfeng Wang
- **Abstract**: To achieve generalized and robust natural-to-formal language conversion (N2F), large language models (LLMs) need to have strong capabilities of decomposition and composition in N2F when faced with an unfamiliar formal language and be able to cope with compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names. To investigate whether LLMs have this set of basic capabilities in N2F, we propose the DEDC framework. This framework semi-automatically performs sample and task construction, allowing decoupled evaluation of the set of decomposition and composition capabilities of LLMs in N2F. Based on this framework, we evaluate and analyze the most advanced LLMs, and the main findings include that: (1) the LLMs are deficient in both decomposition and composition; (2) the LLMs show a wide coverage of error types that can be attributed to deficiencies in natural language understanding and the learning and use of symbolic systems; (3) compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names both affect the decomposition and composition of the LLMs. Our work provides a new perspective for investigating the basic capabilities of decomposition and composition of LLMs in N2F. The detailed analysis of deficiencies and attributions can help subsequent improvements of LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Investigating the (De)Composition Capabilities of Large Language Models in Natural-to-Formal Language Conversion" explores the essential abilities of large language models (LLMs) in converting natural language to formal language (N2F). It introduces a novel framework, DEDC, which facilitates semi-automatic sample and task generation to evaluate LLMs' decomposition and composition capabilities during N2F tasks. The findings reveal that advanced LLMs exhibit significant deficiencies in both decomposition and composition when confronted with unfamiliar formal languages. Errors stem from challenges in natural language understanding and the complexities of symbolic systems, which include compositional gaps and the use of non-intuitive symbolic names. The study aims to illuminate these deficiencies to guide future enhancements of LLMs in N2F processes. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The introduction of the DEDC framework is a notable contribution, aiming to deconstruct and analytically assess LLMs' capabilities in a structured manner. Investigating specific issues like compositional gaps and counter-intuitive symbolic names in the context of N2F adds an important layer to existing research, which has primarily focused on general performance metrics. However, similar evaluations of LLMs have been conducted in various contexts, which may limit the originality of the approach. Thus, while novel in its specific context, the overall concept is not entirely groundbreaking. **Significance:** The paper addresses a critical aspect of LLM performance that is often overlooked: their ability to understand and manipulate formal language structures. This is essential for applications in programming, legal language processing, and any domain where formalization is key. Therefore, the findings regarding LLM's deficiencies have significant implications for both theoretical understanding and practical applications. Identifying specific areas of weakness can guide future research, making the paper influential in directing further studies. **Strengths:** 1. **Framework Development:** The DEDC framework enables a systematic evaluation, which can inform a range of studies. 2. **Focus on Specific Capabilities:** Highlighting decomposition and composition provides a clear direction for improving LLMs, a focus that is often missing in broader evaluations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation:** The range of LLMs assessed could be broader to fully substantiate findings across different model architectures. 2. **Methodological Limitations:** The potential biases in sampling and task construction might affect the generalizability of the results. **Potential Influence:** The research paves the way for deeper investigations into LLM capabilities, pushing developers and researchers to focus on enhancing LLM performance in formal language contexts. By elucidating areas where LLMs struggle, this paper could influence both academic research and practical applications significantly. Given the balance of novelty, significance, strengths, and weaknesses, I assign a score of **7**. This reflects a paper that contributes valuable insights and a structured evaluation framework while recognizing the limitations in its originality and breadth of impact. Score: 7

### MedAgentBench: Dataset for Benchmarking LLMs as Agents in Medical Applications
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14654v1)
- **Authors**: Yixing Jiang, Kameron C. Black, Gloria Geng, Danny Park, Andrew Y. Ng, Jonathan H. Chen
- **Abstract**: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements, particularly in their ability to serve as agents thereby surpassing their traditional role as chatbots. These agents can leverage their planning and tool utilization capabilities to address tasks specified at a high level. However, a standardized dataset to benchmark the agent capabilities of LLMs in medical applications is currently lacking, making the evaluation of LLMs on complex tasks in interactive healthcare environments challenging. To address this gap, we introduce MedAgentBench, a broad evaluation suite designed to assess the agent capabilities of large language models within medical records contexts. MedAgentBench encompasses 100 patient-specific clinically-derived tasks from 10 categories written by human physicians, realistic profiles of 100 patients with over 700,000 data elements, a FHIR-compliant interactive environment, and an accompanying codebase. The environment uses the standard APIs and communication infrastructure used in modern EMR systems, so it can be easily migrated into live EMR systems. MedAgentBench presents an unsaturated agent-oriented benchmark that current state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit some ability to succeed at. The best model (GPT-4o) achieves a success rate of 72%. However, there is still substantial space for improvement to give the community a next direction to optimize. Furthermore, there is significant variation in performance across task categories. MedAgentBench establishes this and is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/MedAgentBench , offering a valuable framework for model developers to track progress and drive continuous improvements in the agent capabilities of large language models within the medical domain.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents MedAgentBench, a novel framework for evaluating the agent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in medical applications. While recent advancements in LLMs have allowed these models to transition from simple chatbots to more sophisticated agents capable of planning and tool utilization, there has been a notable absence of a standardized dataset to benchmark these capabilities in healthcare. MedAgentBench addresses this issue by providing a comprehensive evaluation suite comprising 100 clinically-derived tasks that encompass various patient scenarios, along with detailed profiles of 100 patients. The dataset is characterized by over 700,000 data elements and utilizes a FHIR-compliant interactive framework, which aligns with the architecture of contemporary electronic medical record (EMR) systems. The findings indicate that even the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves a success rate of only 72%, suggesting significant room for improvement. Notably, performance varies significantly across different task categories, highlighting the complexity of the medical domain. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance  The introduction of MedAgentBench marks a substantive contribution to both the fields of artificial intelligence and healthcare. Firstly, it fills a crucial gap by providing a specialized dataset tailored for evaluating LLMs as agents in medical contexts—a crucial distinction considering the unique complexities of healthcare tasks compared to general chatbot interactions. This framework promises to foster advancements in LLM capabilities, which is a vital step for integrating AI into clinical practice. Strengths: - **Novelty**: The creation of a standardized dataset focused specifically on medical applications is a significant improvement over existing benchmarks, which have largely centered on more generalized or non-medical tasks.  - **Scope**: The breadth of tasks and patient variability represented in MedAgentBench enhances its utility for rigorous evaluations that can simplify comparisons across models. - **Practical Relevance**: By aligning with EMR standards, the framework can facilitate future implementations in real-world medical settings, thus offering potential clinical impact. - **Accessibility**: Making the dataset publicly available promotes further research and development among scholars and practitioners, fostering a collaborative approach to resolving challenges in medical AI. Weaknesses: - **Limited Initial Performance**: While it establishes a baseline for model performance, the highest success rate of 72% indicates that current models have not fully exploited their potential, suggesting that MedAgentBench may only incrementally improve existing methods unless further refined. - **Task Variability**: The significant variation in performance across task categories may reflect not just model limitations but also the inherent complexities of certain types of medical inquiries. Future work will need to better understand this variability to create more targeted interventions for improvement. Overall, MedAgentBench is poised to influence the development of LLMs in healthcare by offering a much-needed evaluation framework. It not only advances the field of AI in medical applications but also represents a step towards bridging existing gaps in EMR integration. The potential for real-world application and the encouragement of collaborative research further enhances its significance. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong novelty and potential impact while recognizing that there are still challenges to overcome in fully realizing the benefits of LLM agents in medical applications.

### Diffusion based Text-to-Music Generationwith Global and Local Text based Conditioning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14680v1)
- **Authors**: Jisi Zhang, Pablo Peso Parada, Md Asif Jalal, Karthikeyan Saravanan
- **Abstract**: Diffusion based Text-To-Music (TTM) models generate music corresponding to text descriptions. Typically UNet based diffusion models condition on text embeddings generated from a pre-trained large language model or from a cross-modality audio-language representation model. This work proposes a diffusion based TTM, in which the UNet is conditioned on both (i) a uni-modal language model (e.g., T5) via cross-attention and (ii) a cross-modal audio-language representation model (e.g., CLAP) via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). The diffusion model is trained to exploit both a local text representation from the T5 and a global representation from the CLAP. Furthermore, we propose modifications that extract both global and local representations from the T5 through pooling mechanisms that we call mean pooling and self-attention pooling. This approach mitigates the need for an additional encoder (e.g., CLAP) to extract a global representation, thereby reducing the number of model parameters. Our results show that incorporating the CLAP global embeddings to the T5 local embeddings enhances text adherence (KL=1.47) compared to a baseline model solely relying on the T5 local embeddings (KL=1.54). Alternatively, extracting global text embeddings directly from the T5 local embeddings through the proposed mean pooling approach yields superior generation quality (FAD=1.89) while exhibiting marginally inferior text adherence (KL=1.51) against the model conditioned on both CLAP and T5 text embeddings (FAD=1.94 and KL=1.47). Our proposed solution is not only efficient but also compact in terms of the number of parameters required.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel diffusion-based Text-To-Music (TTM) generation model that conditions a UNet structure on both a uni-modal language model (T5) and a cross-modal audio-language representation model (CLAP). By leveraging cross-attention and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), the model utilizes local text representations from T5 and global representations from CLAP. The authors introduce pooling mechanisms—mean pooling and self-attention pooling—to extract global text features directly from T5, reducing dependency on CLAP and optimizing parameter efficiency. The findings indicate that using CLAP embeddings improves text adherence metrics over a T5-only baseline, while direct extraction from T5 enhances generation quality, albeit with slightly reduced adherence. Overall, the approach demonstrates a compact model architecture with competitive performance metrics. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Integration of Modalities:** The innovative combination of local (T5) and global (CLAP) embeddings enhances the ability to generate music that adheres closely to text descriptions, marking a significant advancement in multimodal generation. 2. **Reduction in Model Complexity:** By extracting global representations directly from T5, the authors contribute to the literature by demonstrating a simpler and more parameter-efficient architecture. This could benefit future research that aims to reduce computational overhead. 3. **Empirical Results:** The paper reports detailed experimental results that validate the proposed methods, showing measurable improvements in key performance metrics (FAD and KL). **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Novelty:** While the technique of integrating multiple embeddings is not entirely new, the unique modifications proposed could be seen as insufficiently distinct from existing models if they do not provide fundamentally new insights into text-to-music generation. 2. **Metric Trade-offs:** The trade-off between text adherence and generation quality when using different conditioning techniques suggests a need for better balance in future designs. The marginal differences in performance could imply that further work is necessary to optimize these trade-offs. **Impact on the Field:** The paper provides a meaningful contribution to the realm of TTM generation by illustrating a multidimensional approach to embedding conditioning. This may catalyze additional research into similar architectures that balance efficiency with output quality. However, the modest novelty and reliance on established models might limit its groundbreaking impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the significance of the methodological improvements and practical implications of the findings, while acknowledging the limitations in novelty and the introduced complexities in model performance that hold back a higher score.

### An Empirical Study on LLM-based Classification of Requirements-related Provisions in Food-safety Regulations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14683v1)
- **Authors**: Shabnam Hassani, Mehrdad Sabetzadeh, Daniel Amyot
- **Abstract**: As Industry 4.0 transforms the food industry, the role of software in achieving compliance with food-safety regulations is becoming increasingly critical. Food-safety regulations, like those in many legal domains, have largely been articulated in a technology-independent manner to ensure their longevity and broad applicability. However, this approach leaves a gap between the regulations and the modern systems and software increasingly used to implement them. In this article, we pursue two main goals. First, we conduct a Grounded Theory study of food-safety regulations and develop a conceptual characterization of food-safety concepts that closely relate to systems and software requirements. Second, we examine the effectiveness of two families of large language models (LLMs) -- BERT and GPT -- in automatically classifying legal provisions based on requirements-related food-safety concepts. Our results show that: (a) when fine-tuned, the accuracy differences between the best-performing models in the BERT and GPT families are relatively small. Nevertheless, the most powerful model in our experiments, GPT-4o, still achieves the highest accuracy, with an average Precision of 89% and an average Recall of 87%; (b) few-shot learning with GPT-4o increases Recall to 97% but decreases Precision to 65%, suggesting a trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning; (c) despite our training examples being drawn exclusively from Canadian regulations, LLM-based classification performs consistently well on test provisions from the US, indicating a degree of generalizability across regulatory jurisdictions; and (d) for our classification task, LLMs significantly outperform simpler baselines constructed using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and automatic keyword extraction.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the integration of large language models (LLMs) into the classification of food-safety regulations and their relevance to modern software systems designed for compliance. Given the evolving landscape of Industry 4.0, the authors address the gap between traditional technology-independent regulations and the software systems that implement them. They accomplish this through two main efforts: a grounded theory study that categorizes food-safety concepts in relation to systems and software requirements, and an empirical evaluation of BERT and GPT models in classifying legal provisions based on these requirements. The main findings reveal that while GPT-4o outperforms both BERT and simpler models, there is a notable trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning. Additionally, the results suggest that the LLMs show promising applicability beyond Canadian regulations, demonstrating their potential for generalizability across different jurisdictions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution**: The intersection of food-safety regulations and advanced LLMs constitutes a relatively unexplored area in the context of legal and regulatory compliance, particularly as it pertains to Industry 4.0. The paper's dual focus on conceptual framework development and empirical performance assessment of LLMs presents a novel contribution to both the fields of regulatory compliance and NLP applications in law. **Strengths**: 1. **Relevance**: The study addresses an urgent need in the food industry for compliance tools that can efficiently parse and relate legal provisions to software systems. 2. **Methodological Rigor**: The grounded theory approach provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding food-safety regulations, while the empirical comparisons between LLMs and baseline models add robustness to the findings. 3. **Generalizability**: The demonstration of LLM effectiveness across different regulatory jurisdictions enhances the practical implication of the study, suggesting that the findings could have wider applicability in various legal contexts. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Context Limitation**: The primary dataset drawn from Canadian regulations may limit the broader applicability of the models in jurisdictions with different regulatory frameworks, despite evidence of generalizability. 2. **Trade-offs discussed**: The paper notes the trade-off between fine-tuning and few-shot learning, but it would benefit from more thorough exploration of practical implications in real-world applications. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results indicate superior performance of LLMs over simpler baselines, further exploration of additional comparative models or methods could strengthen the discussion on why LLMs outperform these baselines. **Impact on the Field**: The study opens new avenues for research on automating legal compliance through AI in the food industry and beyond, encouraging further development of LLM applications in regulatory contexts. However, it will require follow-up research to validate findings across more diverse regulatory systems. ### Score Justification Taking into account the novelty of the research, its relevance to current industry needs, and the robust methodological framework, I assign a score of **8**. This score reflects significant contributions to both the fields of food-safety regulation and NLP, while acknowledging the limitations that warrant additional exploration and validation. Score: 8

### Rethinking Table Instruction Tuning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14693v1)
- **Authors**: Naihao Deng, Rada Mihalcea
- **Abstract**: Recent advances in table understanding have focused on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, existing research has overlooked the impact of hyperparameter choices and lacks a comprehensive evaluation of the out-of-domain table understanding ability and the general capabilities of these table LLMs. In this paper, we evaluate these abilities in existing table LLMs, and reveal significant declines in both out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities compared to their base models. Through systematic analysis, we show that hyperparameters, such as learning rate, can significantly influence both table-specific and general capabilities. Contrary to the existing table instruction-tuning works, we demonstrate that smaller learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while preserving general capabilities. Based on our findings, we introduce TAMA, a TAble LLM instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, which achieves performance on par with, or surpassing GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on table tasks, while maintaining strong out-of-domain generalization and general capabilities. Our findings highlight the potential for reduced data annotation costs and more efficient model development through careful hyperparameter selection.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Rethinking Table Instruction Tuning" addresses a notable gap in current research on instruction-tuning large language models (LLMs) specifically for table-related tasks. The authors argue that prior studies have not adequately explored the implications of hyperparameter choices on model performance. Through empirical evaluations, they indicate that existing table LLMs show significant declines in out-of-domain table understanding and general capabilities when compared to their base models. Their analysis highlights the crucial role of hyperparameters, specifically learning rates, revealing that lower learning rates and fewer training instances can enhance table understanding while maintaining general performance. The authors present TAMA, which is instruction-tuned from LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct, and they demonstrate that TAMA performs comparably to or better than GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in table tasks, while also achieving strong out-of-domain generalization. The findings suggest that careful hyperparameter tuning can lead to more efficient model development and reduced data annotation costs. ### Critical Evaluation: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Focus**: This paper uniquely addresses the largely overlooked impact of hyperparameter choices on the performance of table instruction-tuning in LLMs, filling an important gap in the literature. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: The authors provide systematic analyses that reveal significant declines in model performance—a critical observation that can reshape future work in the field. 3. **Practical Implications**: By introducing TAMA, the authors pave the way for more efficient model tuning, potentially lowering costs related to data annotation and model training. 4. **Comparison with Baselines**: The paper positions TAMA against well-established models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, providing a clear context for its impact and relevance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper presents a critical reevaluation of hyperparameters, it could be argued that the focus remains somewhat narrow; more diversity in the types of tables or tasks examined might strengthen the findings. 2. **Generalization Claims**: Although the authors claim improved out-of-domain generalization, the extent to which results can be generalized across different contexts and domains is not thoroughly discussed. 3. **Reproducibility**: The paper does not provide detailed methodologies for how TAMA was specifically tuned, which may pose challenges for reproducibility and further research based on their findings. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper presents significant contributions by highlighting the often-ignored hyperparameters’ role in table-related LLM performance and effectively introducing a new model, TAMA, which demonstrates improved performance metrics. However, the research could benefit from broader evaluations of different types of data and clearer discussions regarding generalizability and reproducibility. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong contributions to the understanding of table instruction-tuning in LLMs, balanced against the aspects where it could be improved. While the findings have essential implications for future research and practical applications, some areas require further exploration to maximize the paper's impact.

- **Abstract**: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP) has created a critical need for techniques that enable efficient deployment on memory-constrained devices without compromising performance. We present a method to prune LLMs that selectively prunes model blocks based on an importance score and replaces them with a low-parameter replacement strategy. Specifically, we propose a principled metric to replace each pruned block using a weight-sharing mechanism that leverages unpruned counterparts from the model and block-specific low-rank adapters. Furthermore, we facilitate the learning of these replacement blocks with output feature normalization and an adapter initialization scheme built on low-rank SVD reconstructions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 5/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 30% and 6/6 benchmarks for a compression rate of 40%. We also demonstrate that our approach can extend smaller models, boosting performance on 6/6 benchmarks using only ~0.3% tokens of extended training with minimal additional parameter costs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents FlexiGPT, a novel method for pruning and extending large language models (LLMs) to enhance their deployment efficiency on memory-constrained devices. The authors focus on selective pruning of model blocks based on an importance score and replace these blocks with a low-parameter replacement strategy. The replacement mechanism utilizes weight sharing from unpruned blocks and incorporates block-specific low-rank adapters. Key innovations include a metric for the replacement process, output feature normalization, and an initialization scheme based on low-rank singular value decompositions (SVD). The authors report significant empirical gains, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks with compression rates of 30% and 40%. Furthermore, FlexiGPT can enhance the performance of smaller models with minimal additional training data and parameter overhead. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**: FlexiGPT introduces a hybrid innovation combining pruning and low-rank adaptations, aiming to address a crucial bottleneck in deploying large models effectively. This dual strategy of pruning and extending effectively mitigates issues related to memory constraints, making it particularly relevant in the era of constrained device deployments. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The method of weight sharing in conjunction with pruning using importance scores is well thought out and contributes to the literature on efficient model deployment. 2. **Empirical Results**: The paper provides solid empirical evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, indicative of practical utility. 3. **Generalization Capability**: The ability to extend smaller models with minimal additional training is a valuable trait that increases FlexiGPT's applicability. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Comparison**: While the paper claims to outperform existing methods, a more detailed comparative analysis with other recent state-of-the-art pruning techniques would strengthen the claims significantly. 2. **Scalability Concerns**: The effectiveness of the proposed method on extremely large models or very diverse NLP tasks remains unclear, and potential scalability challenges are not addressed. 3. **Model Complexity**: Although flexibility is introduced, the inclusion of numerous parameters (low-rank adapters, SVD reconstructions) may introduce complexity that may not be beneficial under all use cases. **Potential Influence**: The flexibility that FlexiGPT provides could significantly impact how organizations implement LLMs, especially in environments with strict resource limitations. The combination of pruning and extension strategies presents a forward-thinking direction in the field of model optimization. ### Final Score Considering the innovative solutions presented and the practical achievements shown in empirical evaluations, while also accounting for some gaps in thorough comparative analysis and scalability concerns, I assign the paper a score of **8**.

- **Abstract**: Recent advances in natural language processing have leveraged instruction tuning to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) for table-related tasks. However, previous works train different base models with different training data, lacking an apples-to-apples comparison across the result table LLMs. To address this, we fine-tune base models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families on existing public training datasets. Our replication achieves performance on par with or surpassing existing table LLMs, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on Hitab, a table question-answering dataset. More importantly, through systematic out-of-domain evaluation, we decouple the contributions of training data and the base model, providing insight into their individual impacts. In addition, we assess the effects of table-specific instruction tuning on general-purpose benchmarks, revealing trade-offs between specialization and generalization.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper "Towards Better Understanding Table Instruction Tuning: Decoupling the Effects from Data versus Models" addresses the challenges in comparing Large Language Models (LLMs) that are fine-tuned for table-related tasks due to variations in model architectures and training datasets. The authors fine-tune models from the Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families using public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, particularly on the Hitab dataset, a benchmark for table question-answering. A key contribution of this research is the systematic evaluation that distinguishes the impacts of the training data from that of the base models on performance outcomes. Furthermore, the paper explores how instruction tuning specifically for tables might come with trade-offs regarding general-purpose performance, illuminating the balance between specialization and generalization. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** This paper demonstrates a significant advancement in the understanding of instruction tuning in LLMs specifically focused on table-related tasks. By conducting a systematic study that isolates the effects of different base models and training datasets, it contributes valuable insights to the field of NLP, especially in the context of instruction tuning. The approach of explicitly decoupling data and model effects is a refreshing methodology, pushing the boundaries of previous work that failed to make such comparisons. **Significance:** The findings of this paper are significant, particularly in the growing area of LLM utilization for complex data tasks like table processing, which are essential for applications like data retrieval and automated reporting. The results pave the way for refining future models and understanding the interplay of specialization and generalization—a critical consideration for all neural architecture applications. By establishing new state-of-the-art performances, it showcases the feasibility of optimizing existing models rather than solely relying on new model architectures. **Strengths:** 1. **Rigorous Methodology:** The authors' methodology of fine-tuning and systematic evaluation lends credibility to their results. 2. **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Achieving and surpassing previous benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of their approach. 3. **Insightful Analysis:** The paper provides valuable insights into the best practices for instruction tuning, which can influence future research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization Issues:** While the study evaluates generalization versus specialization, the implications could be explored in deeper detail. 2. **Limited scope of models:** The choice of models is limited to Mistral, OLMo, and Phi families, which may restrict the general applicability of the findings to newer or alternative architectures. ### Conclusion The paper makes an essential contribution to the field of NLP by clarifying the factors influencing performance in table instruction tuning while simultaneously achieving notable benchmarking results. However, the exploration of implications for generalization could have been more comprehensive. Overall, the study adds considerable understanding and paves the way for further innovation in LLM tuning for specialized tasks. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Ipek Baris Schlicht, Zhixue Zhao, Burcu Sayin, Lucie Flek, Paolo Rosso
- **Abstract**: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital for public health, but the quality of online health resources varies by language, raising concerns about inconsistencies in Large Language Models (LLMs) for healthcare. In this study, we examine the consistency of responses provided by LLMs to health-related questions across English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. We largely expand the HealthFC dataset by categorizing health-related questions by disease type and broadening its multilingual scope with Turkish and Chinese translations. We reveal significant inconsistencies in responses that could spread healthcare misinformation. Our main contributions are 1) a multilingual health-related inquiry dataset with meta-information on disease categories, and 2) a novel prompt-based evaluation workflow that enables sub-dimensional comparisons between two languages through parsing. Our findings highlight key challenges in deploying LLM-based tools in multilingual contexts and emphasize the need for improved cross-lingual alignment to ensure accurate and equitable healthcare information.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper investigates the consistency of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) to health-related questions translated into multiple languages, focusing on English, German, Turkish, and Chinese. Recognizing that the quality of online health information can differ significantly across languages, the authors enhance the existing HealthFC dataset by introducing a multilingual dimension and categorizing questions by disease type. The study finds substantial discrepancies in the answers provided by LLMs, which raises potential risks of healthcare misinformation. The researchers present a new method for evaluating responses that allows for comparative analysis across languages. Their findings underscore the challenges of utilizing LLMs for healthcare in multi-lingual settings and call for improved alignment in cross-lingual healthcare information dissemination. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's novelty rests in its multidisciplinary approach, addressing a crucial public health concern regarding access to reliable health information across diverse linguistic contexts. By expanding the HealthFC dataset and developing a novel evaluation workflow, the authors contribute both empirical data and a methodological tool for evaluating LLM performance in multilingual healthcare inquiries. This contributes significantly to the discourse on the effectiveness and safety of deploying AI solutions in real-world health scenarios. However, there are notable weaknesses. While the study identifies inconsistencies in responses, it could further investigate underlying causes, such as how different language models or training datasets influence response variations. Additionally, while the expansion of the dataset is commendable, the exploration of only four languages limits the generalizability of findings. There's an implicit assumption that the identified inconsistencies could lead to misinformation without thoroughly examining the implications or context of such misinformation—such as the differing health literacy levels across populations. Despite these drawbacks, the work addresses a pertinent issue in AI deployment for health, advocating for crucial advances in ensuring equitable access to reliable health information. This focus on multilingual healthcare raises awareness of the disparities in AI utility—that elevating one language (e.g., English) might come at the cost of accuracy for others. Overall, the paper is a meaningful contribution to the field of health informatics and AI for healthcare, prompting future research into multilingual training and evaluation of AI systems. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and importance while accounting for limitations in scope and depth that could further enhance the study's impact. The work is positioned to influence subsequent research directions in multilingual healthcare and AI ethics, making its contributions salient for both academia and practical applications.
