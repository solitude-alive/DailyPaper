- **Authors**: Peiling Yi, Arkaitz Zubiaga, Yunfei Long
- **Abstract**: Existing research on detecting cyberbullying incidents on social media has primarily concentrated on harassment and is typically approached as a binary classification task. However, cyberbullying encompasses various forms, such as denigration and harassment, which celebrities frequently face. Furthermore, suitable training data for these diverse forms of cyberbullying remains scarce. In this study, we first develop a celebrity cyberbullying dataset that encompasses two distinct types of incidents: harassment and defamation. We investigate various types of transformer-based models, namely masked (RoBERTa, Bert and DistilBert), replacing(Electra), autoregressive (XLnet), masked&permuted (Mpnet), text-text (T5) and large language models (Llama2 and Llama3) under low source settings. We find that they perform competitively on explicit harassment binary detection. However, their performance is substantially lower on harassment and denigration multi-classification tasks. Therefore, we propose an emotion-adaptive training framework (EAT) that helps transfer knowledge from the domain of emotion detection to the domain of cyberbullying detection to help detect indirect cyberbullying events. EAT consistently improves the average macro F1, precision and recall by 20% in cyberbullying detection tasks across nine transformer-based models under low-resource settings. Our claims are supported by intuitive theoretical insights and extensive experiments.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the nuanced problem of detecting cyberbullying, particularly focusing on harassment and defamation faced by celebrities, which has been underexplored compared to mere harassment detection. The authors create a novel dataset tailored to these two forms of cyberbullying and evaluate multiple transformer-based models on both binary (harassment) and multi-class (harassment and defamation) classification tasks. While performance is solid in binary detection, there is a noted drop in multi-class performance. To bridge this gap, they introduce an emotion-adaptive training (EAT) framework, which integrates emotion detection knowledge into the model training process, yielding a significant 20% improvement in performance metrics across nine models in low-resource settings. The study is grounded with theoretical insights and extensive validation experiments. **Critical Evaluation:** In assessing the paper's novelty and significance, several points stand out highlighted as strengths and weaknesses: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Dataset Creation:** The development of a targeted dataset for cyberbullying, including both harassment and defamation, fills a critical gap in research where such categories are often conflated or neglected. 2. **Comprehensive Model Evaluation:** The authors' exploration of a broad range of transformer architectures (like T5, RoBERTa, Llama2/3) provides valuable insights into their applicability in cyberbullying contexts. 3. **Introduction of EAT Framework:** The proposal of the emotion-adaptive training framework presents a novel approach to enhance model performance, effectively linking two relevant fields (emotion detection and cyberbullying detection). **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The dataset created, while significant, is focused on celebrities, which may limit the generalizability of findings to broader social media contexts where the dynamics of cyberbullying might differ. 2. **Binary vs. Multi-class Performance:** The paper highlights a notable discrepancy between binary and multi-class classification performance without sufficiently addressing the specific reasons behind this gap or potential solutions beyond EAT. 3. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** The improvements noted may invite scrutiny regarding generalizability, particularly in the low-resource setting context. Further validation on diverse datasets would strengthen their claims. Considering these points, the paper presents meaningful advancements in the detection of cyberbullying through novel datasets and methodology, particularly emphasizing the role of emotion in this context. However, limitations regarding scope and validation weaken its broader impact. **Final Score:** 7  This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions to the domain while acknowledging the need for further exploration into its generalizability and an understanding of the underlying model performance discrepancies.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16961v1)
- **Authors**: Mohammad Raza, Natasa Milic-Frayling
- **Abstract**: Robustness of reasoning remains a significant challenge for large language models, and addressing it is essential for the practical applicability of AI-driven reasoning systems. We introduce Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), a novel approach that addresses the key challenge in combining language models with the rigor of logical solvers: to accurately formulate the reasoning problem from natural language to the formal language of the solver. SSV uses a consistency-based approach to produce strong abstract formalizations of problems using concrete instantiations that are generated by the model and verified by the solver. In addition to significantly advancing the overall reasoning accuracy over the state-of-the-art, a key novelty that this approach presents is a feature of verification that has near-perfect precision over a significant coverage of cases, as we demonstrate on open reasoning benchmarks. We propose such *near-certain reasoning* as a new approach to reduce the need for manual verification in many cases, taking us closer to more dependable and autonomous AI reasoning systems.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Instantiation-based Formalization of Logical Reasoning Tasks using Language Models and Logical Solvers" addresses the significant challenge of improving the robustness of reasoning in large language models. The authors introduce a method called Semantic Self-Verification (SSV), which aims to effectively translate natural language reasoning problems into formal languages suited for logical solvers. SSV employs a consistency-based framework that generates concrete instantiations of problems verified by the solver. The novelty of SSV lies in its ability to enhance reasoning accuracy while providing a verification mechanism that boasts near-perfect precision across numerous cases. The authors claim that this mechanism notably reduces the reliance on manual verification, making strides towards creating more reliable AI reasoning systems. **Critical Evaluation:** In evaluating the paper's novelty and significance: 1. **Strengths:**    - **Novel Approach:** The introduction of SSV is a distinctive method that combines language modeling with logical verification, which is an underexplored area in AI research. This synergy is critical as traditional language models often struggle with the precision required in formal logic.    - **Empirical Validation:** The reported results on open reasoning benchmarks suggest a substantial improvement in reasoning accuracy compared to existing methods, which helps to substantiate the authors' claims of significance.    - **Reduction in Manual Work:** By offering near-certain reasoning, the paper addresses a practical concern within the field—reducing the manual effort required for verification processes typically associated with logic-based reasoning. 2. **Weaknesses:**    - **Implementation Details:** The abstract lacks detailed discussion on how SSV handles a variety of natural language complexities and ambiguities that language models encounter, which could limit understanding of the approach's generalizability.    - **Comparative Baselines:** While improvements over state-of-the-art approaches are claimed, the paper would benefit from clearer comparative analyses that highlight specific methods SSV outperforms and elucidate their respective shortcomings.    - **Scope of Application:** The focus on a specific set of benchmarks may raise questions about the approach's applicability across diverse reasoning tasks and settings outside of those tested. 3. **Potential Influence:**    - The paper has the potential to significantly influence the integration of language models in formal reasoning tasks, encouraging future research into hybrid systems that leverage strengths from both paradigms. However, broader acceptance in the field will depend on further validation of the method across varied contexts. Based on these considerations, I assign the paper a score of **Score: 7**. This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with clear novelty and potential impactful advances, though it is tempered by a lack of comprehensive detail on implementation, potential limitations, and a need for more extensive comparative analysis to fully establish its significance.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16975v1)
- **Authors**: Hongzhi Huang, Defa Zhu, Banggu Wu, Yutao Zeng, Ya Wang, Qiyang Min, Xun Zhou
- **Abstract**: Tokenization is a fundamental component of large language models (LLMs), yet its influence on model scaling and performance is not fully explored. In this paper, we introduce Over-Tokenized Transformers, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve language modeling performance. Specifically, our approach scales up input vocabularies to leverage multi-gram tokens. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss, demonstrating that larger input vocabularies consistently enhance model performance, regardless of model size. Using a large input vocabulary, we achieve performance comparable to double-sized baselines with no additional cost. Our findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and provide practical insight for tokenizer design, paving the way for more efficient and powerful LLMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Over-Tokenized Transformer: Vocabulary is Generally Worth Scaling" addresses the significance of tokenization in scaling and performance of large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a new framework named Over-Tokenized Transformers, which separates input and output vocabularies to enhance language modeling efficacy. They demonstrate that increasing the size of input vocabularies, utilizing multi-gram tokens, correlates positively with reduced training loss, thereby leading to improved model performance across varying model sizes. Their experiments reveal that leveraging larger input vocabularies can yield results on par with models having double the size, all without incurring additional costs. The authors emphasize the critical role of tokenization in the scaling laws of LLMs and offer valuable insights for tokenizer design aimed at more powerful and efficient models. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in the introduction of the Over-Tokenized Transformers framework and the exploration of decoupled vocabularies. This approach challenges traditional assumptions regarding fixed tokenization in LLMs and suggests a novel avenue for enhancing performance by scaling input vocabularies. The findings are scientifically grounded through extensive experimentation, which is a significant strength of the work. One of the key contributions is the identification of a log-linear relationship between input vocabulary size and training loss. This insight not only confirms the crucial role of tokenization in model performance but also provides actionable implications for practitioners and researchers designing tokenizers or LLM architectures. However, there are some limitations worth addressing. Firstly, while the paper presents compelling experimental results, it could benefit from a deeper theoretical exploration of the mechanisms behind why scaling input vocabularies leads to better performance. Secondly, the discussion on practical implications for tokenizer design could be expanded to include various use cases or constraints in real-world applications beyond just model performance. Finally, an analysis of trade-offs, such as computational overhead or complexity in managing larger vocabularies, would provide a more balanced perspective. Despite these criticisms, the paper makes a notable contribution to the field by highlighting an underexplored area of model design and providing a methodological framework that can inspire future research. The empirical evidence supporting their claims could significantly influence how researchers approach tokenization in LLM development. Given the paper's contributions, the innovative approach, the clear presentation of results, and its potential impact on the field, I would assign a score of **8**. This reflects a strong and valuable advancement in understanding the role of tokenization in LLMs while acknowledging some areas that could be enhanced for completeness. **Score: 8**

### Artificial Intelligence Clones
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16996v1)
- **Authors**: Annie Liang
- **Abstract**: Large language models, trained on personal data, may soon be able to mimic individual personalities. This would potentially transform search across human candidates, including for marriage and jobs -- indeed, several dating platforms have already begun experimenting with training "AI clones" to represent users. This paper presents a theoretical framework to study the tradeoff between the substantially expanded search capacity of AI clones and their imperfect representation of humans. Individuals are modeled as points in $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, and their AI clones are modeled as noisy approximations. I compare two search regimes: an "in-person regime" -- where each person randomly meets some number of individuals and matches to the most compatible among them -- against an "AI representation regime" -- in which individuals match to the person whose AI clone is most compatible with their AI clone. I show that a finite number of in-person encounters exceeds the expected payoff from search over infinite AI clones. Moreover, when the dimensionality of personality is large, simply meeting two people in person produces a higher expected match quality than entrusting the process to an AI platform, regardless of the size of its candidate pool.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Artificial Intelligence Clones" explores the potential of large language models to create "AI clones" that can mimic individual personalities based on personal data. This innovation may revolutionize search processes in contexts such as dating and employment. Utilizing a theoretical framework, the authors model individuals in a $k$-dimensional Euclidean space, positing that AI clones serve as noisy representations of these individuals. The study contrasts two matching scenarios: the "in-person regime," where people meet and assess compatibility in person, and the "AI representation regime," where individuals match based on AI clone compatibility. The findings reveal that even with a limited number of in-person interactions, the expected match quality outperforms that achieved through AI platforms, particularly in scenarios with high dimensionality of personality. **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a unique conceptual model comparing traditional in-person interactions to modern AI-based matching systems, addressing an increasingly relevant topic in the intersection of technology, psychology, and social science. By demonstrating that human interaction outperforms AI cloning in terms of match quality, the paper challenges the assumption that technology can effectively replace interpersonal relationships in selection processes. **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Framework**: The modeling of individuals in a Euclidean space is an innovative approach that allows for a systematic comparison of search strategies, providing a solid mathematical basis for the findings. 2. **Relevance to Current Trends**: With the rise of AI in personal decision-making, the topic is timely and relevant, potentially guiding future research and practical applications. 3. **Empirical Insights**: By highlighting the limitations of AI clones, the paper encourages a nuanced view of technology's role in human relationships. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Assumptions on Compatibility**: The model's reliance on the assumption that in-person meetings inherently produce more accurate compatibility assessments may lack empirical validation and could benefit from real-world data. 2. **Generalizability**: The findings may not sufficiently account for diverse contexts or cultural differences in interpersonal relationships and matchmaking, which could limit the robustness of the conclusions. 3. **Scalability of Findings**: While the results are compelling, the practicality of integrating these insights into real-world applications of AI for matchmaking is left largely unaddressed. Considering the strengths and weaknesses, the paper makes a notable contribution to the discourse surrounding AI and human relationships, but its assumptions and limited empirical grounding could affect its broader applicability. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution that raises important questions about the role of AI in personal connectivity, tempered by the need for further empirical validation and exploration of the model's assumptions.

- **Authors**: Shreyam Gupta, P. Agrawal, Priyam Gupta
- **Abstract**: Temporal sequence modeling stands as the fundamental foundation for video prediction systems and real-time forecasting operations as well as anomaly detection applications. The achievement of accurate predictions through efficient resource consumption remains an ongoing issue in contemporary temporal sequence modeling. We introduce the Multi-Attention Unit (MAUCell) which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to improve video frame prediction capabilities. Our approach implements three types of attention models to capture intricate motion sequences. A dynamic combination of these attention outputs allows the model to reach both advanced decision accuracy along with superior quality while remaining computationally efficient. The integration of GAN elements makes generated frames appear more true to life therefore the framework creates output sequences which mimic real-world footage. The new design system maintains equilibrium between temporal continuity and spatial accuracy to deliver reliable video prediction. Through a comprehensive evaluation methodology which merged the perceptual LPIPS measurement together with classic tests MSE, MAE, SSIM and PSNR exhibited enhancing capabilities than contemporary approaches based on direct benchmark tests of Moving MNIST, KTH Action, and CASIA-B (Preprocessed) datasets. Our examination indicates that MAUCell shows promise for operational time requirements. The research findings demonstrate how GANs work best with attention mechanisms to create better applications for predicting video sequences.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "MAUCell: An Adaptive Multi-Attention Framework for Video Frame Prediction" proposes a novel framework designed to enhance video frame prediction by incorporating a Multi-Attention Unit (MAUCell). This framework leverages a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and spatio-temporal attention mechanisms to improve both the accuracy and quality of video predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. It employs three types of attention models to better capture complex motion patterns in video sequences. The outputs generated by the framework are said to imitate real-world footage due to the GAN integration, striking a balance between temporal consistency and spatial precision. The approach was evaluated against existing methods on several datasets (Moving MNIST, KTH Action, CASIA-B) using a comprehensive evaluation methodology combining perceptual metrics (LPIPS) with traditional loss measures (MSE, MAE, SSIM, PSNR), demonstrating superior performance and operational efficiency. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty and Impact MAUCell's integration of GANs with an adaptive multi-attention mechanism is a notable contribution to the field of video frame prediction, as it attempts to address the dual challenges of precision and computational sustainability. The originality lies in its combined approach, which has not been extensively explored in previous literature—using multiple attention models to tackle the complexities of video data simultaneously.  - **Strengths:**    - The paper introduces a fresh perspective on enhancing video predictions through adaptive attention mechanisms, which is an important area for improving machine vision systems.    - The use of comprehensive evaluation metrics provides a robust analysis of the model's capabilities compared to existing benchmarks, which lends credibility to the findings.    - The focus on maintaining both temporal continuity and spatial accuracy showcases awareness of the practical demands in real-time applications. - **Weaknesses:**    - While the paper claims that MAUCell produces more lifelike outputs due to its GAN component, it does not sufficiently explore the limitations or potential GAN-related artifacts that might arise in the generated frames.    - The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of the computational efficiency in practical settings, as high computational demands may hinder real-world applications despite theoretical efficiencies presented.    - More extensive comparisons with a broader range of existing techniques could strengthen the paper, as it currently relies on a limited set of datasets for performance validation. #### Overall Assessment Overall, MAUCell represents a solid contribution to the field of video frame prediction by providing a unique solution that blends GANs and attention mechanisms. While the theoretical implications and proposed methodologies are meaningful, the paper could be improved by addressing specific limitations and expanding its comparative analysis. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a well-conceived research endeavor that promises significant advancements in video prediction methodologies. However, the lack of substantial discourse on the practical implications of the model's efficiency and comparison with varying approaches somewhat limits its broader impact within the field.

- **Authors**: Zeeshan Rasheed, Muhammad Waseem, Kai Kristian Kemell, Aakash Ahmad, Malik Abdul Sami, Jussi Rasku, Kari Systä, Pekka Abrahamsson
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as coding assistants, capable of generating source code from natural language prompts. With the increasing adoption of LLMs in software development, academic research and industry based projects are developing various tools, benchmarks, and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated code. However, there is a lack of solutions evaluated through empirically grounded methods that incorporate practitioners perspectives to assess functionality, syntax, and accuracy in real world applications. To address this gap, we propose and develop a multi-model unified platform to generate and execute code based on natural language prompts. We conducted a survey with 60 software practitioners from 11 countries across four continents working in diverse professional roles and domains to evaluate the usability, performance, strengths, and limitations of each model. The results present practitioners feedback and insights into the use of LLMs in software development, including their strengths and weaknesses, key aspects overlooked by benchmarks and metrics, and a broader understanding of their practical applicability. These findings can help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions for systematically selecting and using LLMs in software development projects. Future research will focus on integrating more diverse models into the proposed system, incorporating additional case studies, and conducting developer interviews for deeper empirical insights into LLM-driven software development.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Large Language Models for Code Generation: The Practitioners Perspective" explores the rising role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as coding assistants capable of generating source code based on natural language prompts. Despite their growing integration into software development, the authors identify a significant gap in the empirical evaluation of LLMs from the perspective of practitioners. To address this issue, they developed a multi-model unified platform to generate and execute code and conducted a survey involving 60 software practitioners from various countries and domains. The survey aimed to gather feedback on the usability, performance, and practical implications of LLMs. The results reveal insights regarding the strengths and limitations of LLMs, aspects overlooked by existing benchmarks, and offer guidance for researchers and practitioners on effectively selecting LLMs for development projects. The authors emphasize the importance of continuing research to incorporate a wider variety of models and additional case studies, as well as engaging with developers for more empirical insights into LLM-driven software development. ### Critical Evaluation The paper presents a notable contribution to the field of software engineering, particularly regarding the practical application of LLMs in code generation.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17022v1)
- **Authors**: Kei Katsumata, Motonari Kambara, Daichi Yashima, Ryosuke Korekata, Komei Sugiura
- **Abstract**: We consider the problem of generating free-form mobile manipulation instructions based on a target object image and receptacle image. Conventional image captioning models are not able to generate appropriate instructions because their architectures are typically optimized for single-image. In this study, we propose a model that handles both the target object and receptacle to generate free-form instruction sentences for mobile manipulation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel training method that effectively incorporates the scores from both learning-based and n-gram based automatic evaluation metrics as rewards. This method enables the model to learn the co-occurrence relationships between words and appropriate paraphrases. Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms baseline methods including representative multimodal large language models on standard automatic evaluation metrics. Moreover, physical experiments reveal that using our method to augment data on language instructions improves the performance of an existing multimodal language understanding model for mobile manipulation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the challenge of generating tailored mobile manipulation instructions from images of a target object and a receptacle. Traditional image captioning methods struggle with this task as they are designed for single-image input. The authors propose a novel model that effectively processes both images to produce coherent and relevant manipulation instructions. Additionally, they introduce a unique training approach that employs a combination of learning-based and n-gram based automatic evaluation metrics as rewards, promoting improved word co-occurrence and paraphrase learning. The effectiveness of their method is showcased through superior performance against baseline models, as evidenced by both standard automatic evaluation metrics and enhanced results in practical physical experiments where the data augmentation of language instructions improved a multimodal language understanding model. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper offers noteworthy advancements in the realm of mobile manipulation instruction generation by bridging gaps left by conventional image captioning techniques. Its focus on the dual input of target and receptacle images is particularly significant, as it reflects a more realistic scenario in robotic manipulation tasks — moving beyond simple object recognition to complex task execution. This dual-focus approach could spark further research into more integrated multimodal systems and their applications in robotics and AI-assisted task management. The proposed training method is also a strong point, as it innovates on existing metrics by integrating both learned and statistical measures to create a more robust feedback loop for instruction generation. This can lead to a more nuanced understanding of language generation models in robotics, emphasizing the importance of context and relationships between words. However, the paper's evaluation techniques, primarily reliant on automatic metrics, can be critiqued for being potentially insufficient, particularly in a field where subjective language interpretation plays a crucial role. While the authors do conduct physical experiments, the clarity and range of tasks executed are not detailed enough, which raises questions about the generalizability of their findings across various real-world scenarios. Moreover, while the results indicate improvements over baseline methods, it would strengthen the work to include a broader comparison to more advanced models that have emerged post their evaluation, as this could provide a clearer picture of their model's standing in a rapidly developing field. In summary, the paper presents a fresh perspective and methodological innovation that has clear implications for advancing mobile manipulation technologies. Its strengths lie in its dual-image approach and innovative training method. However, it could further benefit from more diverse evaluation metrics and applications. **Score: 7**

### Automated Refactoring of Non-Idiomatic Python Code: A Differentiated Replication with LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17024v1)
- **Authors**: Alessandro Midolo, Massimiliano Di Penta
- **Abstract**: In the Python ecosystem, the adoption of idiomatic constructs has been fostered because of their expressiveness, increasing productivity and even efficiency, despite controversial arguments concerning familiarity or understandability issues. Recent research contributions have proposed approaches -- based on static code analysis and transformation -- to automatically identify and enact refactoring opportunities of non-idiomatic code into idiomatic ones. Given the potential recently offered by Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks, in this paper, we present the results of a replication study in which we investigate GPT-4 effectiveness in recommending and suggesting idiomatic refactoring actions. Our results reveal that GPT-4 not only identifies idiomatic constructs effectively but frequently exceeds the benchmark in proposing refactoring actions where the existing baseline failed. A manual analysis of a random sample shows the correctness of the obtained recommendations. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs to achieve tasks where, in the past, implementing recommenders based on complex code analyses was required.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Automated Refactoring of Non-Idiomatic Python Code: A Differentiated Replication with LLMs" explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, in automating the refactoring of non-idiomatic Python code into idiomatic constructs. It highlights the significance of idiomatic programming for efficiency and productivity in Python, and presents a replication study that investigates GPT-4's ability to recommend idiomatic refactoring actions. The results demonstrate that GPT-4 not only effectively identifies idiomatic constructs but also outperforms existing benchmarks in suggesting refactoring actions that previous methods failed to address. The manual review of a sample of recommendations further confirms their correctness, suggesting a major shift in how LLMs can replace more complex and static code analysis tools in this context. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its application of LLMs to a specific problem within the field of software engineering—automatically transforming non-idiomatic Python code. The potential impact of this work is significant; it presents a streamlined approach that could alleviate the manual burden of refactoring while improving code quality. Particularly, the paper addresses an emerging trend of leveraging advanced AI for code-related tasks, which could enhance developers' workflows by integrating LLM capabilities into code editors or development environments. However, the paper does have some limitations. While the analysis of GPT-4's effectiveness is compelling, the study would benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation across different types of non-idiomatic code and contexts. Additionally, it may lack insights into potential performance issues related to the scalability of their approach or the robustness of the recommendations in more complex coding scenarios. Furthermore, the paper does not critically address the possible downsides of reliance on LLMs, such as the need for proper oversight or potential inaccuracies that may arise in less straightforward cases. Overall, the approach appears innovative, and the findings make a strong contribution to the conversation about automated code refactoring. Therefore, I assess the paper to have a moderate to high impact due to its novel integration of LLMs into a practical software engineering challenge and its implications for future practice in code quality assessment and improvement. **Score: 8**

### Challenges in Ensuring AI Safety in DeepSeek-R1 Models: The Shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning Strategies
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17030v1)
- **Authors**: Manojkumar Parmar, Yuvaraj Govindarajulu
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, alignment, and task-specific performance. However, ensuring harmlessness in these systems remains a critical challenge, particularly in advanced models like DeepSeek-R1. This paper examines the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the primary approach for reducing harmful outputs in DeepSeek-R1 and compares it with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While RL improves reasoning capabilities, it faces challenges such as reward hacking, generalization failures, language mixing, and high computational costs. We propose hybrid training approaches combining RL and SFT to achieve robust harmlessness reduction. Usage recommendations and future directions for deploying DeepSeek-R1 responsibly are also presented.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Challenges in Ensuring AI Safety in DeepSeek-R1 Models: The Shortcomings of Reinforcement Learning Strategies" addresses the significant challenge of maintaining harmlessness in advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) like DeepSeek-R1. It critically evaluates the limitations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a method for reducing harmful outputs, highlighting issues such as reward hacking, generalization failures, and the substantial computational costs associated with RL. In contrast, the authors argue for the efficacy of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and suggest a hybrid training approach that integrates both RL and SFT to enhance the safety and harmlessness of the model outputs. The paper concludes by offering recommendations for the responsible deployment of DeepSeek-R1. --- **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant exploration of an important topic within the AI safety domain, particularly focusing on the challenges associated with Reinforcement Learning in large language models. Its novelty lies in the critical analysis of existing methods and the proposal for hybrid training techniques, which are relevant in an era where the safety of AI technologies is paramount.  **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance and Timeliness:** The subject matter is highly relevant given the current landscape of AI development, where ensuring safety is a growing concern. 2. **Critical Analysis:** The authors provide a thoughtful critique of RL's limitations, which can guide future research directions. 3. **Hybrid Approach:** The suggestion for a hybrid training method is a constructive contribution that encourages innovation in AI safety strategies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The paper could benefit from empirical data or case studies to support its claims regarding RL shortcomings and the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid approach. 2. **Generalizability Issues:** The findings and recommendations appear focused on DeepSeek-R1; their applicability to other LLMs or systems remains somewhat uncertain without additional context. 3. **Limited Exploration of Alternatives:** While it critiques RL and promotes a hybrid model, a broader discussion of alternative safety measures or methodologies could enhance the depth of analysis. In terms of its potential influence, the paper engages with a crucial aspect of AI development and suggests a practical pathway forward, which could prompt further investigation and refinement in the field. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's contributions to the discourse on AI safety, its timely relevance, and the thoughtful critique of existing methods. However, the lack of empirical backing and broader explorations slightly diminishes its impact, warranting a slightly lower score than exceptional contributions.

### Enhanced Retrieval of Long Documents: Leveraging Fine-Grained Block Representations with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17039v1)
- **Authors**: Minghan Li, Eric Gaussier, Guodong Zhou
- **Abstract**: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Enhanced Retrieval of Long Documents: Leveraging Fine-Grained Block Representations with Large Language Models" introduces a refined method for improving the retrieval of long documents using large language models (LLMs). The authors critique existing practices which produce a single embedding per query or document, as exemplified by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, noting that this approach overlooks the complex nuances inherent in lengthy texts. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a fine-grained strategy that divides long documents into smaller, manageable blocks. Each block is then independently embedded using an LLM, and relevance between the query and each block is assessed. The query-block relevance scores are aggregated through a weighted sum to derive a comprehensive score for the entire document's relevance. The results of the experiments indicate that this technique not only surpasses traditional methods in terms of accuracy but also significantly reduces latency in the generation of embeddings. Additionally, optimized pairwise loss functions contribute to enhanced performance outcomes. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper's proposal to segment documents into blocks for fine-grained processing demonstrates significant innovation. This method addresses a well-known limitation of coarse representations, marking it as a notable improvement in the field of information retrieval. 2. **Clear Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide experimental results to substantiate their claims about performance improvements and reduced latency, which strengthens the paper's validity. 3. **Improvement in Relevance Scoring:** The introduction of a weighted aggregation method for scoring relevance offers a novel perspective on how document representations can be enhanced, potentially influencing future research on relevance metrics in document retrieval systems. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation:** While the method shows promise, the paper does not extensively discuss the range of document types or contexts in which the new method operates best. More diverse evaluations could enhance the robustness of the findings. 2. **Potential Overfitting Concerns:** The optimization of pairwise loss functions, while beneficial, also raises concerns about the potential for overfitting, particularly if the new method is trained on a narrow dataset. 3. **Broader Generalizability:** The applicability of the fine-grained block approach to other domains outside long document retrieval is not addressed, which could limit its potential influence. **Conclusion:** The paper presents a substantial advancement in utilizing LLMs for document retrieval, addressing key limitations of existing methods with a well-structured and tested alternative. However, the scope of application and potential overfitting remain points for further exploration. **Score: 8**   This score reflects a strong contribution to the field of document retrieval, balancing the innovation of the proposed method with the necessity for broader application and validation across varied contexts. While the findings are significant, the identified weaknesses suggest that further research could amplify the impact of this work.

### Synthesizing 3D Abstractions by Inverting Procedural Buildings with Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17044v2)
- **Authors**: Maximilian Dax, Jordi Berbel, Jan Stria, Leonidas Guibas, Urs Bergmann
- **Abstract**: We generate abstractions of buildings, reflecting the essential aspects of their geometry and structure, by learning to invert procedural models. We first build a dataset of abstract procedural building models paired with simulated point clouds and then learn the inverse mapping through a transformer. Given a point cloud, the trained transformer then infers the corresponding abstracted building in terms of a programmatic language description. This approach leverages expressive procedural models developed for gaming and animation, and thereby retains desirable properties such as efficient rendering of the inferred abstractions and strong priors for regularity and symmetry. Our approach achieves good reconstruction accuracy in terms of geometry and structure, as well as structurally consistent inpainting.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Synthesizing 3D Abstractions by Inverting Procedural Buildings with Transformers" presents a novel method for generating abstracted representations of buildings by utilizing a transformer to invert procedural modeling techniques. It begins by creating a dataset that pairs abstract procedural building models with corresponding simulated point clouds. The key innovation lies in the training of a transformer to map point clouds back to their abstracted building descriptions in a programmatic language format. This approach capitalizes on existing procedural models that are advantageous for efficient rendering and adherence to geometric regularities and symmetries. The results indicate successful reconstruction with high accuracy in both geometry and overall structure, complemented by structurally coherent inpainting of the buildings. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Use of Transformers:** The application of transformers to invert procedural models is a noteworthy approach, especially in the context of bridging the gap between abstract representations and concrete geometries. 2. **Dataset Quality:** The development of a paired dataset enhances the model's training capacity, which is crucial for effective learning in generative tasks. 3. **Incorporation of Procedural Models:** By employing established procedural modeling techniques from gaming and animation, the authors position their work within a familiar framework that emphasizes efficiency and aesthetic quality. 4. **Reconstruction Accuracy:** The reported results indicate a robust performance in terms of geometry and structural coherence, which are essential factors in any architectural modeling task. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Depth of Evaluation:** While the paper mentions reconstruction accuracy, it lacks a detailed comparative analysis with existing methods for generating building models. This omission limits the reader's understanding of its relative advantages and possible drawbacks. 2. **Scope of Application:** The reliance on procedural models might restrict the method's generalizability to various architectural styles beyond those represented within the dataset. 3. **Ambiguity in Practical Applications:** While the paper suggests the utility of the method for rendering abstractions efficiently, it does not elaborate significantly on real-world applications or implications of the findings. 4. **Potential Overfitting:** The deep learning methodologies, particularly using transformers, inherently risk overfitting, especially with smaller or less diverse datasets. The paper could benefit from discussing the robustness of the method against such risks. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of 3D modeling by integrating machine learning with procedural generation. Despite some limitations in the discussion of applicability and comparative depth, the innovative application and solid results offer significant insights into future research directions. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a balance between the novelty of applying transformers in this context and the need for more comprehensive evaluation against existing techniques. There is a clear potential for further exploration and innovation, making this paper a significant, yet not groundbreaking, contribution to the field of 3D abstraction and procedural modeling.

### Tailored Truths: Optimizing LLM Persuasion with Personalization and Fabricated Statistics
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17273v1)
- **Authors**: Jasper Timm, Chetan Talele, Jacob Haimes
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly persuasive, demonstrating the ability to personalize arguments in conversation with humans by leveraging their personal data. This may have serious impacts on the scale and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. We studied the persuasiveness of LLMs in a debate setting by having humans $(n=33)$ engage with LLM-generated arguments intended to change the human's opinion. We quantified the LLM's effect by measuring human agreement with the debate's hypothesis pre- and post-debate and analyzing both the magnitude of opinion change, as well as the likelihood of an update in the LLM's direction. We compare persuasiveness across established persuasion strategies, including personalized arguments informed by user demographics and personality, appeal to fabricated statistics, and a mixed strategy utilizing both personalized arguments and fabricated statistics. We found that static arguments generated by humans and GPT-4o-mini have comparable persuasive power. However, the LLM outperformed static human-written arguments when leveraging the mixed strategy in an interactive debate setting. This approach had a $\mathbf{51\%}$ chance of persuading participants to modify their initial position, compared to $\mathbf{32\%}$ for the static human-written arguments. Our results highlight the concerning potential for LLMs to enable inexpensive and persuasive large-scale disinformation campaigns.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Tailored Truths: Optimizing LLM Persuasion with Personalization and Fabricated Statistics" investigates the persuasive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in changing human opinions during debates. The authors conducted an experiment with 33 human participants who engaged with LLM-generated arguments designed to alter their viewpoints. They measured the influence of these arguments by assessing changes in participant agreement before and after the debate. The study compared various persuasion strategies including personalized arguments based on user demographics, the use of fabricated statistics, and a hybrid approach combining both. The findings revealed that while human-written static arguments and those generated by the LLM (specifically GPT-4o-mini) exhibited similar persuasive strengths, the mixed strategy utilizing both personalization and fabricated statistics significantly enhanced persuasion effectiveness. The LLM achieved a 51% success rate in persuading participants compared to 32% for static human arguments. The results underscore the potential risks of LLMs in facilitating deceptive disinformation campaigns. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation  **Novelty and Significance**:  The study presents several compelling novel aspects. First, it highlights the intersection of LLM capabilities and psychological persuasion strategies, shedding light on the implications of LLMs in social discourse and informing our understanding of how personalized communications can be weaponized in the context of disinformation. Furthermore, the combination of personalization and fabricated statistics as a potent persuasion method provides valuable insight into how LLMs can optimize their influence, which has not been extensively explored in existing literature. **Strengths**: 1. **Methodological Approach**: The use of a debate setting is a strong point, allowing for real-time human interaction with LLM-generated arguments, lending ecological validity to the results. 2. **Quantitative Measurements**: The focus on pre-and post-debate opinion changes provides a robust evaluation of persuasiveness, making the findings more credible. 3. **Relevance**: Given the rise of LLMs and the prevalence of misinformation online, this work is timely and relevant, offering directed insights for policymakers and technologists alike. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Sample Size**: The relatively small sample size (n=33) limits the generalizability of the findings. Larger studies would be beneficial for confirming results across a more diverse participant pool. 2. **Scope of Analysis**: While the paper does cover various strategies, it does not deeply investigate the psychological mechanisms behind the effectiveness of these strategies, which could enhance understanding of why certain arguments work better. 3. **Ethical Implications**: Although the paper notes the potential for enabling disinformation campaigns, it could benefit from a more nuanced discussion about ethics and responsible usage of LLM technology. **Potential Influence**:  The paper's findings may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of LLMs in contexts involving persuasion, especially for marketing and political campaigns. As LLMs integrate more fully into societal communications, understanding their persuasive capabilities will be imperative. **Score Justification**:  Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses noted above, this paper provides a noteworthy contribution to the ongoing dialogue about LLMs and their societal implications, though it remains somewhat preliminary due to its sample size and limited scope. Therefore, it merits a moderate to high score reflecting its impact and the critical issues it raises. **Score: 7**

### From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282v1)
- **Authors**: Shilong Deng, Yongzhao Wang, Rahul Savani
- **Abstract**: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework for converting natural language descriptions of games into extensive-form representations using Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Recognizing the challenge posed by games of varied strategic complexity (especially imperfect information), the authors propose a two-stage approach: the first stage focuses on identifying information sets and constructing a partial game structure, while the second stage employs in-context learning combined with a self-debugging module to generate a complete extensive-form game tree represented in pygambit. The framework allows for automated computations of Nash equilibria and demonstrates superior performance over baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games across various strategic complexities, highlighting how each module contributes to its overall effectiveness. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper's integration of LLMs for game representation is notable, especially in that it introduces a structured framework that effectively navigates the complexities of imperfect information games. This marks a significant contribution, as previous efforts have been less systematic and largely focused either on well-defined games or lacked adequate granularity for handling real-world language descriptions efficiently. **Significance:** The potential to automate the translation of natural language into rigorous extensive-form game representations could have profound implications for fields like game theory, artificial intelligence, and economics. By enabling easier computation of solutions like Nash equilibria directly from descriptions, it opens the door for broader accessibility and application of game-theoretic analysis. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: The two-stage approach is a thoughtful response to the limitations of current methods in handling varying levels of information. 2. **Practical Applications**: The use of pygambit allows integration with established game-theoretic tools, enhancing usability. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The evaluation against various LLMs and strategic complexities provides solid empirical backing for the claims of improved performance. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependency on LLMs**: The framework's effectiveness is tied to the capabilities of the employed LLMs, which can vary significantly and may not generalize well to all forms of natural language input. 2. **Complexity in Implementation**: While the framework enhances in-context learning, the complexity of the two-stage process may pose challenges for practical implementation outside of laboratory settings. **Overall Impact:** While the paper introduces a sophisticated and potentially transformative tool for gamers and theorists alike, its dependency on LLM capabilities and implementation complexities might compromise its widespread applicability in varied real-life contexts. Considering these points, I would assign a **score of 8** to the paper. It indeed holds substantial novelty and promises significant advancements in game theory applications, although its practical implementation hurdles temper its immediate impact and accessibility. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Background: The radiation oncology clinical practice involves many steps relying on the dynamic interplay of abundant text data. Large language models have displayed remarkable capabilities in processing complex text information. But their direct applications in specific fields like radiation oncology remain underexplored. Purpose: This study aims to investigate whether fine-tuning LLMs with domain knowledge can improve the performance on Task (1) treatment regimen generation, Task (2) treatment modality selection (photon, proton, electron, or brachytherapy), and Task (3) ICD-10 code prediction in radiation oncology. Methods: Data for 15,724 patient cases were extracted. Cases where patients had a single diagnostic record, and a clearly identifiable primary treatment plan were selected for preprocessing and manual annotation to have 7,903 cases of the patient diagnosis, treatment plan, treatment modality, and ICD-10 code. Each case was used to construct a pair consisting of patient diagnostics details and an answer (treatment regimen, treatment modality, or ICD-10 code respectively) for the supervised fine-tuning of these three tasks. Open source LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B models were utilized for the fine-tuning with the Low-Rank Approximations method. Accuracy and ROUGE-1 score were reported for the fine-tuned models and original models. Clinical evaluation was performed on Task (1) by radiation oncologists, while precision, recall, and F-1 score were evaluated for Task (2) and (3). One-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to statistically analyze the results. Results: Fine-tuned LLMs outperformed original LLMs across all tasks with p-value <= 0.001. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that over 60% of the fine-tuned LLMs-generated treatment regimens were clinically acceptable. Precision, recall, and F1-score showed improved performance of fine-tuned LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper explores the application of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) specifically for tasks in radiation oncology, a field that relies heavily on text data. The study targeted three key tasks: treatment regimen generation, treatment modality selection, and ICD-10 code prediction. Utilizing a dataset derived from 15,724 patient cases, the authors fine-tuned two open-source models (LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B) with domain-specific knowledge. After implementing a supervised fine-tuning procedure and employing statistical analysis methods, it was found that the fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the original models across all tasks. Clinically, more than 60% of the treatment regimens generated by the fine-tuned models were deemed acceptable by radiation oncologists, with improvements noted in precision, recall, and F-1 scores for the selected tasks. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** This paper introduces a novel application of fine-tuning open-source LLMs within the niche of radiation oncology, offering insights into their performance on specific clinical tasks.

### Mitigating Hallucinated Translations in Large Language Models with Hallucination-focused Preference Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17295v1)
- **Authors**: Zilu Tang, Rajen Chatterjee, Sarthak Garg
- **Abstract**: Machine Translation (MT) is undergoing a paradigm shift, with systems based on fine-tuned large language models (LLM) becoming increasingly competitive with traditional encoder-decoder models trained specifically for translation tasks. However, LLM-based systems are at a higher risk of generating hallucinations, which can severely undermine user's trust and safety. Most prior research on hallucination mitigation focuses on traditional MT models, with solutions that involve post-hoc mitigation - detecting hallucinated translations and re-translating them. While effective, this approach introduces additional complexity in deploying extra tools in production and also increases latency. To address these limitations, we propose a method that intrinsically learns to mitigate hallucinations during the model training phase. Specifically, we introduce a data creation framework to generate hallucination focused preference datasets. Fine-tuning LLMs on these preference datasets reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 96% across five language pairs, while preserving overall translation quality. In a zero-shot setting our approach reduces hallucinations by 89% on an average across three unseen target languages.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach to mitigating hallucinated translations in machine translation systems based on large language models (LLMs). Recognizing the increased risk of hallucination in LLMs as compared to traditional encoder-decoder models, the authors criticize prior methods that focus on post-hoc mitigation—detecting and correcting hallucinations after the translation task—which complicates deployment and increases latency. Instead, they propose an intrinsic solution that incorporates a data creation framework for generating hallucination-focused preference datasets during model training. Fine-tuning LLMs with these datasets demonstrated a 96% reduction in hallucinations across five language pairs while maintaining translation quality. Additionally, in a zero-shot scenario with three unseen languages, hallucinations were reduced by 89%. **Evaluation:** The paper introduces a noteworthy improvement in mitigating one of the most significant drawbacks of LLMs in machine translation: hallucinations. The intrinsic approach contrasts with the prevailing methods, addressing both the efficiency and effectiveness of hallucination reduction. By focusing on data creation during training, this work delivers a solution that streamlines the translation process and enhances user trust in the outputs.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach**: The method of generating hallucination-focused preference datasets is innovative and offers a shift in how hallucinations are addressed, moving away from reactive measures to proactive training enhancements. 2. **Quantitative Results**: The paper provides substantial experimental evidence, demonstrating a significant decrease in hallucination rates across various languages, reinforcing the efficacy of the proposed method. 3. **Broader Applicability**: The findings imply that this approach could benefit various applications of LLMs beyond just machine translation, potentially influencing future model training strategies across multiple domains. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Language Pairs Tested**: While results are promising, the evaluation is limited to five language pairs, which may not capture the breadth of linguistic challenges or variances present in other languages. 2. **Generality of Findings**: The reduction rates in unseen languages are compelling but could raise questions regarding the generalizability of the method to all language pairs and contexts. 3. **Lack of Ablation Studies**: The paper would benefit from deeper analysis (such as ablation studies) to discern the contributions of different aspects of their approach, ensuring that the improvements can be attributed unequivocally to the proposed datasets. Overall, while the paper presents a significant advance in the field of machine translation, its impact might be enhanced by broader testing and further exploration of the method's limits and capabilities. **Score: 8**   This high score reflects the paper's innovative contributions to an urgent problem in LLM deployment, although some limitations in scope and applicability temper its potential for transformative influence in the broader MT field.

- **Authors**: Emily Tseng, Meg Young, Marianne Aubin Le Quéré, Aimee Rinehart, Harini Suresh
- **Abstract**: Journalism has emerged as an essential domain for understanding the uses, limitations, and impacts of large language models (LLMs) in the workplace. News organizations face divergent financial incentives: LLMs already permeate newswork processes within financially constrained organizations, even as ongoing legal challenges assert that AI companies violate their copyright. At stake are key questions about what LLMs are created to do, and by whom: How might a journalist-led LLM work, and what can participatory design illuminate about the present-day challenges about adapting ``one-size-fits-all'' foundation models to a given context of use? In this paper, we undertake a co-design exploration to understand how a participatory approach to LLMs might address opportunities and challenges around AI in journalism. Our 20 interviews with reporters, data journalists, editors, labor organizers, product leads, and executives highlight macro, meso, and micro tensions that designing for this opportunity space must address. From these desiderata, we describe the result of our co-design work: organizational structures and functionality for a journalist-controlled LLM. In closing, we discuss the limitations of commercial foundation models for workplace use, and the methodological implications of applying participatory methods to LLM co-design.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Ownership, Not Just Happy Talk": Co-Designing a Participatory Large Language Model for Journalism addresses the intersection of journalism and large language models (LLMs), focusing on the necessity of participatory design in the development of LLMs tailored for journalistic purposes. It highlights the conflicting financial pressures faced by news organizations that are compelled to adopt LLMs amid legal challenges regarding copyright issues. The authors explore the concept of a journalist-led LLM and its potential to meet the unique needs of the journalism field while transitioning away from standardized models. Through 20 interviews with various stakeholders in journalism, the study reveals complex tensions at multiple levels—macro (industry-wide concerns), meso (organizational structures), and micro (individual user needs). The paper culminates in proposing organizational structures and functionalities for a journalist-controlled LLM and critiques the inadequacies of commercial foundation models for journalism. It also discusses the methodological implications of using participatory design methods in LLM development. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Timeliness**: The paper addresses a pressing and contemporary issue—the intersection of AI technology and journalism, which is increasingly relevant given the rapid adoption of LLMs in various fields, including news media. 2. **Participatory Design Focus**: By emphasizing a participatory approach, the authors advocate for the agency of journalists in the design process, which is often neglected in technology-driven contexts. This focus is crucial for developing tools that are truly fit for purpose in journalistic work. 3. **Rich Data**: The use of 20 interviews with diverse stakeholders contributes valuable qualitative insights, shedding light on the multifaceted challenges and opportunities when integrating LLMs into journalistic practices. 4. **Practical Implications**: The proposed organizational structures for a journalist-controlled LLM provide actionable insights that could inform the development of future technologies tailored for journalists. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the insights are derived from interviews with select stakeholders, their views may not represent the entire spectrum of the journalism industry, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings across different news organizations. 2. **Lack of Quantitative Analysis**: The paper relies heavily on qualitative data without offering any quantitative measures or frameworks that could further support its claims, which may weaken the robustness of its conclusions. 3. **Limited Scope**: The paper primarily focuses on the operationalization of LLMs within journalism, missing opportunities to explore broader ethical implications associated with AI use in media, such as misinformation and bias. **Overall Evaluation:** Despite its strong foundation in participatory design and the timely nature of its subject matter, the paper has limitations in generalizability and scope. However, its contribution to understanding how journalists can navigate and shape the development of LLMs makes it significant for both academic discourse and practical implementations within the field. The balance between these factors suggests a solid, albeit not groundbreaking, contribution to the field of AI and journalism. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Yun-Shiuan Chuang, Nikunj Harlalka, Sameer Narendran, Alexander Cheung, Sizhe Gao, Siddharth Suresh, Junjie Hu, Timothy T. Rogers
- **Abstract**: Guesstimation, the task of making approximate quantity estimates, is a common real-world challenge. However, it has been largely overlooked in large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) research. We introduce a novel guesstimation dataset, MARBLES. This dataset requires one to estimate how many items (e.g., marbles) can fit into containers (e.g., a one-cup measuring cup), both with and without accompanying images. Inspired by the social science concept of the ``{Wisdom of Crowds'' (WOC) - taking the median from estimates from a crowd), which has proven effective in guesstimation, we propose ``WOC decoding'' strategy for LLM guesstimation. We show that LLMs/VLMs perform well on guesstimation, suggesting that they possess some level of a "world model" necessary for guesstimation. Moreover, similar to human performance, the WOC decoding method improves LLM/VLM guesstimation accuracy. Furthermore, the inclusion of images in the multimodal condition enhances model performance. These results highlight the value of WOC decoding strategy for LLMs/VLMs and position guesstimation as a probe for evaluating LLMs/VLMs' world model.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Probing LLM World Models: Enhancing Guesstimation with Wisdom of Crowds Decoding" addresses the often-neglected task of guesstimation in the context of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). It presents a novel dataset called MARBLES, where users estimate the number of items that can fit into containers, both with and without images as context. The authors employ the "Wisdom of Crowds" (WOC) approach by using median estimates to improve accuracy, demonstrating that LLMs and VLMs can surprisingly perform well in this task, indicating an underlying "world model." They find that incorporating images further enhances performance, thereby validating the WOC decoding strategy and emphasizing its utility in assessing LLMs/VLMs' capabilities. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The introduction of the MARBLES dataset fills a gap in existing research, specifically targeting a practical yet often overlooked problem — guesstimation. This is a valuable contribution to the field of AI as it broadens the scope of tasks that LLMs and VLMs can be assessed against. 2. **Utilization of WOC Concept:** By adapting the Wisdom of Crowds concept to “WOC decoding,” the authors present a novel methodology that has shown tangible improvements in guesstimation accuracy, which could inspire further research into collaborative estimation approaches in machine learning. 3. **Multimodal Analyses:** The finding that the inclusion of images significantly enhances performance provides insights into how multimodality can improve understanding and capabilities of AI models, particularly in estimation tasks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the dataset and method are novel, the application of guesstimation can be seen as narrow, and its implications might not extend as far across different domains within AI. It may also lack direct applications outside of the specific context provided by the dataset. 2. **Research Ecosystem Impact:** The existing literature on the capabilities of LLMs and VLMs in various tasks is extensive. The paper does not sufficiently position its findings relative to this broader landscape, nor does it discuss potential limitations of using Guesstimation as a probe for LLMs/VLMs' world models fully. 3. **Evaluation Metrics:** While the paper shows improved performance metrics, a more thorough statistical analysis or comparison with other models would enhance the robustness of the claims regarding the efficacy of the WOC decoding strategy. Overall, the paper presents a commendable effort in tackling a real-world problem with innovative methodologies that meld social science concepts with AI. However, its somewhat constrained application and potential lack of broader significance in advancing the field limit its impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution with practical implications and methodological innovation, balanced by concerns regarding the breadth of applicability and the need for more comprehensive examinations of findings.

- **Authors**: Kevin Ferguson, Yu-hsuan Chen, Levent Burak Kara
- **Abstract**: The discovery and study of new material systems relies on molecular simulations that often come with significant computational expense. We propose MDDM, a Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model, which is capable of predicting a valid output conformation for a given input pair potential function. After training MDDM on a large dataset of molecular dynamics self-assembly results, the proposed model can convert uniform noise into a meaningful output particle structure corresponding to an arbitrary input potential. The model's architecture has domain-specific properties built-in, such as satisfying periodic boundaries and being invariant to translation. The model significantly outperforms the baseline point-cloud diffusion model for both unconditional and conditional generation tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents MDDM, a Molecular Dynamics Diffusion Model designed to predict particle self-assembly efficiently. Traditional molecular simulations are often computationally intensive, prompting the authors to develop this model that can generate valid particle structures from arbitrary input potential functions. Trained on a comprehensive dataset of molecular dynamics results, MDDM effectively transforms uniform noise into meaningful particle configurations, leveraging its architecture's built-in domain-specific features like periodic boundary conditions and translational invariance.

- **Abstract**: Clinical diagnosis prediction models, when provided with a patient's medical history, aim to detect potential diseases early, facilitating timely intervention and improving prognostic outcomes. However, the inherent scarcity of patient data and large disease candidate space often pose challenges in developing satisfactory models for this intricate task. The exploration of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for encapsulating clinical decision processes has been limited. We introduce MERA, a clinical diagnosis prediction model that bridges pertaining natural language knowledge with medical practice. We apply hierarchical contrastive learning on a disease candidate ranking list to alleviate the large decision space issue. With concept memorization through fine-tuning, we bridge the natural language clinical knowledge with medical codes. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and IV datasets show that MERA achieves the state-of-the-art diagnosis prediction performance and dramatically elevates the diagnosis prediction capabilities of generative LMs.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces MERA, a novel clinical diagnosis prediction model that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve early detection of diseases by analyzing patient medical histories. Addressing challenges such as limited patient data and a vast array of potential diseases, MERA employs hierarchical contrastive learning to effectively rank disease candidates and fine-tunes its approach through concept memorization, linking clinical knowledge to medical coding. Results from testing on MIMIC-III and IV datasets demonstrate that MERA surpasses previous benchmarks for diagnosis prediction, showcasing its capability to enhance generative LMs in medical applications. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its innovative approach to integrating LLMs into the domain of clinical diagnosis prediction, an area traditionally hampered by data scarcity and large decision spaces. By leveraging hierarchical contrastive learning and concept memorization, MERA proposes a unique methodology that significantly enhances the predictive performance of generative models in clinical settings. This advancement could have substantial implications for improving healthcare outcomes through timely interventions. However, while the methodology is compelling, the paper could have benefited from a more extensive exploration of the real-world applicability of MERA. The clinical validation of the model, including an assessment of its robustness in diverse patient populations and settings, remains essential for practical implementation but appears to be somewhat limited in the presented results. Additionally, the paper could further detail its comparison with existing state-of-the-art models and discuss scalability concerns regarding the trained model's integration into existing healthcare systems. Furthermore, while achieving state-of-the-art performance is significant, the paper does not provide a thorough discussion on potential ethical considerations, biases present in the training data, or the implications of deploying such models in clinical practice. Overall, MERA represents a noteworthy advance in leveraging LLMs for medical applications, yet it could offer deeper insights into practical usage and surrounding challenges. **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field with novel methodologies and promising results, balanced against the need for further exploration of practical implications and broader validation. This positions the paper as a significant but not entirely transformative entry in the literature on clinical diagnosis prediction.

- **Authors**: Aleksandar Petrov, Shruti Agarwal, Philip H. S. Torr, Adel Bibi, John Collomosse
- **Abstract**: Watermarking, the practice of embedding imperceptible information into media such as images, videos, audio, and text, is essential for intellectual property protection, content provenance and attribution. The growing complexity of digital ecosystems necessitates watermarks for different uses to be embedded in the same media. However, to detect and decode all watermarks, they need to coexist well with one another. We perform the first study of coexistence of deep image watermarking methods and, contrary to intuition, we find that various open-source watermarks can coexist with only minor impacts on image quality and decoding robustness. The coexistence of watermarks also opens the avenue for ensembling watermarking methods. We show how ensembling can increase the overall message capacity and enable new trade-offs between capacity, accuracy, robustness and image quality, without needing to retrain the base models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the coexistence of multiple watermarking methods in digital media, specifically focusing on deep image watermarking techniques. It presents a novel approach by demonstrating that various existing watermarks can be embedded in the same image with minimal impact on both the quality and the robustness of decoding. This finding challenges conventional wisdom about watermarking interference. Furthermore, the authors propose the concept of ensembling different watermarking methods, which could enhance overall message capacity while providing flexibility in balancing trade-offs among capacity, accuracy, robustness, and image quality, all without the need for retraining the underlying models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The paper introduces an original angle to watermarking by specifically examining the coexistence of multiple watermarking techniques and exploring the potential for ensembling them. This is a significant advancement in a field where traditional approaches often focus on single watermarking instances. The contradiction of existing assumptions about the detrimental effects of overlapping watermarks is a noteworthy contribution. **Significance**:  The implications of this research extend across multiple domains, including digital rights management and media content attribution, making it relevant for both academic and industry practitioners. If multiple watermarks can effectively coexist, this could enable more robust copyright protection strategies and enhanced provenance tracking. **Strengths**: 1. **Empirical Study**: The research is grounded in empirical findings, which provides a solid foundation for its claims about coexistence. 2. **Practical Applications**: Ensembling offers practical advantages, suggesting that this approach could be adopted easily within existing frameworks. 3. **Broad Relevance**: The paper addresses a current and pressing issue in digital media, underscoring its relevance in modern digital ecosystems. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Study**: While the study shows minor impacts on quality and robustness, it may not account for all potential conflicts or degradation across different media types or under extreme conditions. 2. **Lack of Comprehensive Framework**: The paper could benefit from a more clearly defined framework for how to implement the ensembling method practically and what specific metrics should be prioritized. 3. **Limited Discussion of Risks**: While coexistence is shown to be effective, the potential risks, security vulnerabilities, and ethical concerns related to watermarking may not be fully addressed. **Conclusion**: The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of watermarking by challenging prior assumptions and extending the capabilities of watermarking approaches with ensembling. However, the findings should be validated in broader contexts with various watermarking applications and potential vulnerabilities examined further. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's innovative exploration of watermark coexistence and ensembling, alongside its practical implications, while recognizing the need for broader validation and discussion around potential risks.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17386v1)
- **Authors**: Richard Katrix, Quentin Carroway, Rowan Hawkesbury, Matthias Heathfield
- **Abstract**: Context-aware processing mechanisms have increasingly become a critical area of exploration for improving the semantic and contextual capabilities of language generation models. The Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism (CASRM) was introduced as a novel framework designed to address limitations in coherence, contextual adaptability, and error propagation in large-scale text generation tasks. Through the integration of dynamically generated context vectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM enhances the alignment between token-level representations and broader contextual dependencies. Experimental evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in semantic coherence across multiple domains, including technical, conversational, and narrative text. The ability to adapt to unseen domains and ambiguous inputs was evaluated using a diverse set of test scenarios, highlighting the robustness of the proposed mechanism. A detailed computational analysis revealed that while CASRM introduces additional processing overhead, the gains in linguistic precision and contextual relevance outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. The framework also successfully mitigates error propagation in sequential tasks, improving performance in dialogue continuation and multi-step text synthesis. Additional investigations into token-level attention distribution emphasized the dynamic focus shifts enabled through context-aware enhancements. The findings suggest that CASRM offers a scalable and flexible solution for integrating contextual intelligence into existing language model architectures.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper introduces the Context-Aware Semantic Recomposition Mechanism (CASRM), a framework aimed at enhancing the semantic coherence and contextual adaptability of large language models (LLMs). By utilizing dynamically generated context vectors and attention modulation layers, CASRM improves how token representations relate to broader context. Experimental results reveal that CASRM significantly enhances semantic coherence across technical, conversational, and narrative domains and demonstrates adaptability to unseen contexts. The paper emphasizes CASRM's ability to reduce error propagation in multi-step tasks such as dialogue continuation, achieving better performance despite slight increases in computational complexity. The findings showcase CASRM as a promising strategy for integrating contextual intelligence into LLM architectures. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Mechanism:** CASRM presents a unique approach to enhance the contextual adaptability of LLMs, addressing a critical gap in current models that often struggle with coherence and context. 2. **Robust Experimental Evaluation:** The thorough testing across diverse domains (technical, conversational, narrative) provides compelling evidence of CASRM's effectiveness, enhancing the paper's credibility. 3. **Error Mitigation:** The focus on reducing error propagation is particularly relevant in dialogue systems and other sequential tasks, marking significant advancement in practical language applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Computational Overhead:** While the authors acknowledge the increase in complexity, the potential limitations of CASRM's scalability due to this overhead could impact its adoption in resource-constrained environments. 2. **Future Work:** The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on limitations and potential areas for future research, particularly in terms of how CASRM might perform in even less structured or highly varied contexts. **Overall Impact:**  The contribution to the field is notable because it targets a fundamental limitation in existing large language models by enhancing context-aware processing. This is especially pertinent as the demand for more coherent and adaptive models grows. The relevance of the framework extends to various applications where coherent language generation is crucial, thus suggesting a broad potential impact. **Score:** 8 The score of 8 reflects the paper's significant advancements in introducing CASRM as a promising solution to existing challenges in LLMs, balanced with considerations regarding its computational efficiency and scope for future enhancement. Although it presents a strong contribution, it stops short of an exceptional rating due to unresolved questions about long-term applicability and scalability in diverse scenarios. Overall, the CASRM's potential to reshape context-dependent language generation earns it a solid position within the research landscape.

### MultiChallenge: A Realistic Multi-Turn Conversation Evaluation Benchmark Challenging to Frontier LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17399v1)
- **Authors**: Ved Sirdeshmukh, Kaustubh Deshpande, Johannes Mols, Lifeng Jin, Ed-Yeremai Cardona, Dean Lee, Jeremy Kritz, Willow Primack, Summer Yue, Chen Xing
- **Abstract**: We present MultiChallenge, a pioneering benchmark evaluating large language models (LLMs) on conducting multi-turn conversations with human users, a crucial yet underexamined capability for their applications. MultiChallenge identifies four categories of challenges in multi-turn conversations that are not only common and realistic among current human-LLM interactions, but are also challenging to all current frontier LLMs. All 4 challenges require accurate instruction-following, context allocation, and in-context reasoning at the same time. We also develop LLM as judge with instance-level rubrics to facilitate an automatic evaluation method with fair agreement with experienced human raters. Despite achieving near-perfect scores on existing multi-turn evaluation benchmarks, all frontier models have less than 50% accuracy on MultiChallenge, with the top-performing Claude 3.5 Sonnet (June 2024) achieving just a 41.4% average accuracy.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces MultiChallenge, a novel benchmark aimed at assessing the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage effectively in multi-turn conversations, which is increasingly important in practical applications. The benchmark identifies four categories of challenges that reflect common issues faced in real human-LLM interactions, focusing on skills such as accurate instruction-following, context allocation, and in-context reasoning. The authors also present an automated evaluation framework involving LLMs as judges, which demonstrates high correlation with evaluations by human raters. Despite existing benchmarks showing high performance from frontier LLMs, they struggle with MultiChallenge, with the best-performing model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieving only a 41.4% accuracy. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of the paper lies in its systematic approach to defining and evaluating multi-turn conversation capabilities of LLMs, which has not been extensively addressed in prior research. The identification of realistic challenges that LLMs face in these settings is significant because it reflects real-world interactions and highlights the limitations of current models. Furthermore, the methodology of using LLMs as judges for evaluation could pave the way for automatic assessment in other areas of AI research. However, while the benchmark itself is innovative, the impact may be somewhat limited by the following considerations: 1. **Replicability and Scalability:** The challenges outlined may not cover all potential scenarios faced in multi-turn conversations, which could limit the benchmark's generalizability. 2. **Comparison with Prior Work:** While the paper claims that current models underperform on this new benchmark, it does not in-depth explore how these results compare with more tailored evaluation strategies for specific conversational contexts, perhaps overlooking insights from previous evaluations. 3. **Implementation of Findings:** The practical implications of the benchmark in driving improvements in LLMs are yet to be observed, limiting the immediate influence of the study. Given these strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of **8**. The paper innovatively addresses a critical gap in LLM evaluations and proposes a feasible assessment framework, but its broader influence may be contingent on future work validating and expanding these findings in varied conversational settings. **Score: 8**

### Actions Speak Louder than Words: Agent Decisions Reveal Implicit Biases in Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17420v1)
- **Authors**: Yuxuan Li, Hirokazu Shirado, Sauvik Das
- **Abstract**: While advances in fairness and alignment have helped mitigate overt biases exhibited by large language models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted, we hypothesize that these models may still exhibit implicit biases when simulating human behavior. To test this hypothesis, we propose a technique to systematically uncover such biases across a broad range of sociodemographic categories by assessing decision-making disparities among agents with LLM-generated, sociodemographically-informed personas. Using our technique, we tested six LLMs across three sociodemographic groups and four decision-making scenarios. Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant sociodemographic disparities in nearly all simulations, with more advanced models exhibiting greater implicit biases despite reducing explicit biases. Furthermore, when comparing our findings to real-world disparities reported in empirical studies, we find that the biases we uncovered are directionally aligned but markedly amplified. This directional alignment highlights the utility of our technique in uncovering systematic biases in LLMs rather than random variations; moreover, the presence and amplification of implicit biases emphasizes the need for novel strategies to address these biases.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper, "Actions Speak Louder than Words: Agent Decisions Reveal Implicit Biases in Language Models," addresses the lingering implicit biases in large language models (LLMs) despite advancements in fairness and bias alignment. The authors propose a methodology for systematically revealing these biases through decision-making disparities associated with LLM-generated personas that reflect various sociodemographic backgrounds. They evaluated six LLMs across three sociodemographic groups and four decision-making scenarios. Findings indicate that these models exhibit significant sociodemographic differences in their decision-making, with more advanced models revealing even greater implicit biases, which are amplified compared to real-world empirical disparities. The results suggest the need for innovative strategies to combat these biases in LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Contribution:** The novelty of the paper lies in its focus on implicit biases through decision-making scenarios, a complementary approach to existing studies that primarily focus on explicit biases through text prompts. By developing a methodology that tests LLMs in more dynamic and realistic contexts, the authors provide a fresh lens through which to examine bias in AI, pushing the boundaries of bias assessment methodologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Systematic Analysis**: The paper presents a robust methodology for uncovering implicit biases that may be overlooked in traditional testing frameworks. 2. **Empirical Findings**: The findings demonstrate a significant and concerning amplification of biases in more advanced models, identifying a critical gap in current understandings of AI fairness. 3. **Real-World Alignment**: The correlation of their findings with real-world disparities enhances the relevance and urgency of addressing these biases, providing a compelling argument for more substantial interventions. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper tests a range of sociodemographic categories, the choice of specific groups and decision scenarios may limit the generalizability of the findings. More diverse scenarios would strengthen the conclusions. 2. **Potential Overemphasis on Advanced Models**: The focus on more advanced models raising implicit biases requires caution; it might deter attention from addressing biases prevalent in less sophisticated models that still have significant societal implications. 3. **Mitigation Strategies**: The paper calls for novel strategies to mitigate identified biases but does not propose concrete solutions or frameworks for future research in that area. **Potential Influence:** This paper has potential to influence research on AI bias significantly by steering attention toward the implicit biases in decision-making processes. It highlights an area that warrants deeper investigation and could inspire future studies aimed at developing systematic interventions to improve AI fairness. **Score: 8**  **Rationale:** The paper offers a meaningful contribution to the understanding of biases in language models by introducing a new method for their assessment and revealing critical findings about implicit biases that persist despite efforts to align explicit outcomes. While there are limitations regarding the scope of testing and a lack of mitigation strategies, the overall impact on the field is noteworthy. The significant amplification of real-world biases in model outputs calls for urgent attention to AI fairness, signifying an influential piece of work worthy of an 8 out of 10 score.

### SIGN: A Statistically-Informed Gaze Network for Gaze Time Prediction
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17422v1)
- **Authors**: Jianping Ye, Michel Wedel
- **Abstract**: We propose a first version of SIGN, a Statistically-Informed Gaze Network, to predict aggregate gaze times on images. We develop a foundational statistical model for which we derive a deep learning implementation involving CNNs and Visual Transformers, which enables the prediction of overall gaze times. The model enables us to derive from the aggregate gaze times the underlying gaze pattern as a probability map over all regions in the image, where each region's probability represents the likelihood of being gazed at across all possible scan-paths. We test SIGN's performance on AdGaze3500, a dataset of images of ads with aggregate gaze times, and on COCO-Search18, a dataset with individual-level fixation patterns collected during search. We demonstrate that SIGN (1) improves gaze duration prediction significantly over state-of-the-art deep learning benchmarks on both datasets, and (2) can deliver plausible gaze patterns that correspond to empirical fixation patterns in COCO-Search18. These results suggest that the first version of SIGN holds promise for gaze-time predictions and deserves further development.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SIGN (Statistically-Informed Gaze Network), a novel framework designed to predict aggregate gaze times on images through a combination of statistical modeling and deep learning techniques, including CNNs and Visual Transformers. The model not only estimates overall gaze durations but also generates probability maps reflecting the likelihood of gaze fixation across various regions in an image. The authors evaluate SIGN on two datasets: AdGaze3500, which contains advertisements with collective gaze data, and COCO-Search18, focused on individual fixation patterns during search tasks. Results indicate that SIGN significantly outperforms existing deep learning benchmarks in gaze time prediction and successfully simulates realistic gaze patterns in accordance with empirical data on COCO-Search18, highlighting its potential for further development in the gaze prediction domain. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The significance of SIGN lies in its integration of statistical insights with deep learning techniques to enhance gaze prediction—an area of considerable interest in human-computer interaction, marketing, and cognitive psychology. The dual functionality of predicting gaze time and producing spatial probability maps is a noteworthy advancement, as it provides richer outputs than traditional gaze prediction models. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of statistical models with deep learning methodologies is relatively novel in the context of gaze prediction, addressing limitations of prior models that may not consider underlying statistical distributions of gaze behaviors comprehensively. 2. **Benchmark Improvement**: The reported significant improvement over state-of-the-art models across two different datasets underscores the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework. 3. **Empirical Validation**: Successfully producing plausible gaze patterns that align with actual fixation data enhances the credibility of the model’s outputs and provides practical validation for its applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Data Dependency**: The performance claims are heavily reliant on the datasets used. The generalizability of SIGN to other types of images or real-world scenarios remains to be thoroughly validated. 2. **First Version Limitations**: As a first iteration, SIGN may have limitations that future versions could address. Specific challenges in fine-tuning the model or enhancing its interpretability were not extensively discussed in the paper. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the paper highlights improvements, a more detailed comparative analysis against a broader range of existing models could further substantiate its claims. Overall, the paper appears to make meaningful strides in the gaze prediction field but is not without its limitations. The presented results are promising, yet further research is necessary to fully realize and validate the potential of SIGN in diverse applications. **Score: 7** This score reflects a solid contribution to the gaze prediction literature while acknowledging the need for more extensive validation and application testing to enhance its impact and robustness.

### Virus: Harmful Fine-tuning Attack for Large Language Models Bypassing Guardrail Moderation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17433v1)
- **Authors**: Tiansheng Huang, Sihao Hu, Fatih Ilhan, Selim Furkan Tekin, Ling Liu
- **Abstract**: Recent research shows that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to harmful fine-tuning attacks -- models lose their safety alignment ability after fine-tuning on a few harmful samples. For risk mitigation, a guardrail is typically used to filter out harmful samples before fine-tuning. By designing a new red-teaming method, we in this paper show that purely relying on the moderation guardrail for data filtration is not reliable. Our proposed attack method, dubbed Virus, easily bypasses the guardrail moderation by slightly modifying the harmful data. Experimental results show that the harmful data optimized by Virus is not detectable by the guardrail with up to 100\% leakage ratio, and can simultaneously achieve superior attack performance. Finally, the key message we want to convey through this paper is that: \textbf{it is reckless to consider guardrail moderation as a clutch at straws towards harmful fine-tuning attack}, as it cannot solve the inherent safety issue of the pre-trained LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Virus
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Virus: Harmful Fine-tuning Attack for Large Language Models Bypassing Guardrail Moderation" addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to harmful fine-tuning attacks. It reveals that LLMs lose their safety alignment after being fine-tuned with a few harmful samples. Traditionally, guardrails are employed to filter these harmful samples prior to fine-tuning to mitigate risks. However, the authors propose a new attack method called "Virus," which can effectively bypass these guardrails by making slight modifications to harmful data. Experimental results indicate that data optimized using Virus goes undetected by the guardrail, showing a leakage ratio of up to 100% while simultaneously achieving high attack effectiveness. The authors argue that relying solely on guardrail moderation is insufficient and that it does not address the fundamental safety issues related to pre-trained LLMs. The paper concludes with a cautionary statement about the inadequacies of current moderation strategies. ### Evaluation **Novelty**: The paper introduces a new attack methodology (Virus) that challenges existing safety mechanisms (guardrails) employed in LLMs. While the notion of exploiting vulnerabilities in model safety is not new, the specific approach and comprehensive experimental validation provided here offer significant insights. The ability of Virus to bypass guardrails with a high leakage ratio presents a fresh perspective on the robustness of current moderation tactics. **Significance**: The implications of this research are substantial, as it highlights critical flaws in current safety measures for LLMs, raising awareness about the potential risks associated with deploying these models. The findings could drive future research toward developing more resilient guardrail systems or alternative safety frameworks.  **Strengths**: 1. **Conceptual Contribution**: The introduction of the Virus method and the demonstration of its efficacy in bypassing guardrail moderation add meaningful new knowledge to the field. 2. **Experimental Results**: The paper includes robust experimental data showing the attack's effectiveness, which underpins the authors' claims about the insufficiency of guardrails. 3. **Clear Messaging**: The authors’ strong warning against over-reliance on guardrails is a valuable take-home message for practitioners. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Attack**: While the paper effectively demonstrates the Virus attack's success, it could further explore how to mitigate such attacks or propose alternative strategies to enhance model safety. 2. **Real-World Applicability**: The paper could benefit from discussing the real-world implications of these results more extensively and how they affect the practical deployment of LLMs. **Overall Assessment**: The paper does an excellent job of contributing to the discourse on LLM safety and the reliability of moderation systems. However, it would benefit from a broader context about future defenses and more extensive commentary on real-world applications.  Score: **7**

- **Authors**: Kaiwei Luo, Jiliu Zhou
- **Abstract**: Flight trajectory prediction is a critical time series task in aviation. While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The study addresses the significant challenge of flight trajectory prediction by leveraging large language models (LLMs), reframing the problem as a language modeling task. It utilizes features derived from ADS-B flight data to create a prompt-based dataset, transforming trajectory waypoints into language tokens. The authors fine-tuned various LLMs, showing that they can successfully capture complex spatiotemporal patterns leading to improved accuracy in both single-step and multi-step trajectory predictions. Notably, the LLaMA-3.1 model outperformed traditional approaches. Despite the promising results, the study highlights high inference latency of LLMs, which raises concerns for their applicability in real-time scenarios, indicating a need for further exploration in this area. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper is notable for pioneering the application of LLMs to the niche but crucial area of flight trajectory prediction, an endeavor that has not been extensively studied before in this context. By framing trajectory prediction as a language modeling challenge, the authors introduce a fresh perspective that could change traditional approaches and methodologies in aviation data analysis. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: Recasting trajectory prediction as a language problem is a creative and novel strategy. It effectively harnesses the capabilities of LLMs, which have shown remarkable performance in various NLP tasks. 2. **Empirical Evidence**: The paper presents comprehensive experiments demonstrating the superiority of LLMs over traditional methods in trajectory accuracy, supporting its claims with robust data. 3. **Potential for Impact**: If further refined, the adoption of LLMs in flight trajectory could significantly transform predictive analytics in aviation, aiding in more accurate flight planning and safety measures. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Inference Latency**: The high inference latency is a critical drawback for real-time applications. The authors acknowledge this issue but do not thoroughly explore potential solutions or optimizations that could enhance practical usability. 2. **Generality of Results**: The findings may be somewhat limited to the specific datasets used. Broader validation across diverse flight conditions and datasets will be essential to establish generalizability. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: While the performance of LLMs is highlighted, a more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning methods (beyond just accuracy metrics) would provide a better context for understanding the true effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed models. **Impact on the Field:** This study opens new avenues for further research combining language models with time series prediction. Its pioneering approach may inspire other researchers to explore LLMs in various domains where traditional methods face limitations. However, the limitations around inference latency and the need for broader validation may temper the immediate impact. **Score: 7** The paper exhibits notable novelty and presents a clear advancement in methodology for flight trajectory prediction. However, the challenges posed by inference latency and the need for further validation and comparative analysis limit its current applicability and immediate influence. A score of 7 reflects these considerations, indicating significant contributions while acknowledging areas for improvement and further research.

### AugmenTest: Enhancing Tests with LLM-Driven Oracles
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17461v1)
- **Authors**: Shaker Mahmud Khandaker, Fitsum Kifetew, Davide Prandi, Angelo Susi
- **Abstract**: Automated test generation is crucial for ensuring the reliability and robustness of software applications while at the same time reducing the effort needed. While significant progress has been made in test generation research, generating valid test oracles still remains an open problem. To address this challenge, we present AugmenTest, an approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer correct test oracles based on available documentation of the software under test. Unlike most existing methods that rely on code, AugmenTest utilizes the semantic capabilities of LLMs to infer the intended behavior of a method from documentation and developer comments, without looking at the code. AugmenTest includes four variants: Simple Prompt, Extended Prompt, RAG with a generic prompt (without the context of class or method under test), and RAG with Simple Prompt, each offering different levels of contextual information to the LLMs. To evaluate our work, we selected 142 Java classes and generated multiple mutants for each. We then generated tests from these mutants, focusing only on tests that passed on the mutant but failed on the original class, to ensure that the tests effectively captured bugs. This resulted in 203 unique tests with distinct bugs, which were then used to evaluate AugmenTest. Results show that in the most conservative scenario, AugmenTest's Extended Prompt consistently outperformed the Simple Prompt, achieving a success rate of 30\% for generating correct assertions. In comparison, the state-of-the-art TOGA approach achieved 8.2\%. Contrary to our expectations, the RAG-based approaches did not lead to improvements, with performance of 18.2\% success rate for the most conservative scenario.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents **AugmenTest**, a novel approach to automated test generation that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate test oracles from software documentation and developer comments, rather than the underlying code. The authors introduce four variants for this process: Simple Prompt, Extended Prompt, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with a generic prompt, and a RAG approach with a Simple Prompt. They evaluate AugmenTest on 142 Java classes, generating tests from mutant classes to ensure the identification of unique bugs. Results indicate that the Extended Prompt variant notably outperforms both the Simple Prompt and the state-of-the-art TOGA method, achieving 30% success in generating correct assertions compared to TOGA's 8.2%. However, the RAG-based methods did not improve performance as expected, yielding an 18.2% success rate in the conservative scenario. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** AugmenTest represents a significant innovation in the field of automated software testing by going beyond traditional approaches that typically rely on analysis of code to infer test oracles. Its use of LLMs to interpret documentation and comments introduces an engaging shift, potentially enabling automated testing to cover aspects of software behavior that may not be immediately obvious in the code itself. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Use of LLMs**: Harnessing LLMs for generating test oracles leverages their extensive language understanding capabilities, making AugmenTest a pioneering effort in this realm. 2. **Performance Evaluation**: The comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art methods provides a clear demonstration of AugmenTest's effectiveness, particularly its Extended Prompt variant. 3. **Focus on Bug Identification**: By concentrating on tests that pass mutants but fail on the original, the authors methodically ensure that the generated tests are actually useful for fault detection. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited RAG Success**: The underperformance of the RAG approaches raises questions about the optimization of contextual inputs and suggests that simply augmenting the data might not be sufficient for improvement. 2. **Context Dependency**: Despite achieving impressive results with the Extended Prompt, the reliance on quality and clarity of documentation can be a limitation in environments where documentation may be sparse or poorly written. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: While the paper compares AugmenTest with TOGA, further comparison with a broader array of existing methods could provide a more holistic view of its relative performance. Overall, this paper holds notable promise for evolving the area of automated testing, particularly in scenarios with rich documentation. The innovative approach to oracles through LLMs aligns well with current trends in AI and software development. **Influence on the Field:** If further validated and adapted across different programming contexts, AugmenTest could significantly enhance the process of test generation and improve software reliability, particularly in domain areas where documentation is available and maintained. ### Score: 8/10 The score reflects a strong contribution to the field due to the innovative application of LLMs in test oracle generation, rising above conventional methods. However, the mixed results with the RAG approaches and potential dependency issues on documentation quality prevent it from receiving the highest rating. Nonetheless, the paper’s insights and its potential impact on automated testing are substantial, warranting an 8 out of 10.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17468v1)
- **Authors**: Matt C. Bendel, Saurav K. Shastri, Rizwan Ahmad, Philip Schniter
- **Abstract**: Imaging inverse problems can be solved in an unsupervised manner using pre-trained diffusion models. In most cases, that involves approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function in the reverse process. Since the approximations produced by existing methods are quite poor, especially early in the reverse process, we propose a new approach that re-estimates and renoises the image several times per diffusion step. Renoising adds carefully shaped colored noise that ensures the pre-trained diffusion model sees white-Gaussian error, in accordance with how it was trained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our "DDfire" method at 20, 100, and 1000 neural function evaluations on linear inverse problems and phase retrieval.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents a novel method called "DDfire" for solving imaging inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models in an unsupervised manner. Traditional approaches often rely on approximating the gradient of the measurement-conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process, which can lead to poor outcomes, especially in the early stages. The authors propose that by re-estimating and adding structured colored noise (renoisings) at multiple points within each diffusion step, the method better aligns with the white-Gaussian errors the model was trained on. The effectiveness of DDfire is demonstrated across various linear inverse problems and phase retrieval scenarios, showing improvements with varying evaluations. **Evaluation**: The paper introduces a significant methodological innovation by enhancing the way diffusion models are employed for imaging inverse problems. The core novelty lies in its approach of Renoising, which effectively addresses a recognized shortcoming of existing gradient approximation methods. This is particularly relevant, as poor performance at early stages of reverse diffusion is a critical bottleneck in many applications, and the proposed solution is grounded in a well-thought-out adjustment to how noise is introduced to the process. Strengths: 1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of multiple renoisings per diffusion step is an innovative modification that has the potential to improve results in situations where gradient approximations are typically inadequate. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The method is not only proposed theoretically but is also empirically validated across different scenarios, showcasing its versatility and robustness. 3. **Potential Impact**: If effectively implemented, DDfire could enhance various applications in imaging technologies, which tend to rely on diffusion modeling. Weaknesses: 1. **Specificity to Linear Problems**: The experiments predominantly focus on linear inverse problems and phase retrieval, leaving questions about scalability and applicability to non-linear problems or more complex scenarios unexplored. 2. **Complexity of Implementation**: Introducing multiple renoisings might increase computational overhead, and the trade-off between quality improvement and computational efficiency must be carefully considered and articulated. 3. **Generality of Results**: The paper should discuss how its findings translate to other types of diffusion models or possibly even different classes of inverse problems. In summary, the paper demonstrates a significant novel approach with empirical results supporting its effectiveness. However, it could benefit from broader applicability and discussion regarding computational efficiency. **Score: 8**.

- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various natural language processing tasks but often struggle to excel uniformly in diverse or complex domains. We propose a novel ensemble method - Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), which leverages the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to achieve more robust performance. Our approach involves: (1) clustering models based on response "fingerprints" patterns, (2) applying a quantile-based filtering mechanism to remove underperforming models at a per-subject level, and (3) assigning adaptive weights to remaining models based on their subject-wise validation accuracy. In experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark, DFPE outperforms the best single model by 3% overall accuracy and 5% in discipline-level accuracy. This method increases the robustness and generalization of LLMs and underscores how model selection, diversity preservation, and performance-driven weighting can effectively address challenging, multi-faceted language understanding tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DFPE: A Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble for Enhancing LLM Performance" presents a novel ensemble method designed to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex natural language processing tasks. The approach, termed Diverse Fingerprint Ensemble (DFPE), consists of three key steps: (1) clustering multiple LLMs based on their output "fingerprints," (2) employing quantile-based filtering to discard underperforming models for each specific task, and (3) applying adaptive weighting to the selected models according to their validation accuracy in relevant domains. Experimental results using the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark demonstrate that DFPE achieves a 3% increase in overall accuracy and a 5% improvement in discipline-specific accuracy compared to the best single LLM. The findings highlight how model selection and diversity management can enhance LLM robustness and generalization in multi-faceted language understanding tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a notable contribution to the field of natural language processing, particularly in the context of ensemble learning applied to LLMs. The concept of utilizing diverse "fingerprints" to cluster models and subsequently improve performance through systematic filtering and adaptive weighting is innovative. This method addresses the inherent weaknesses of individual LLMs by harnessing their complementary strengths, which is an important step toward building more resilient models. **Strengths:** - The theoretical underpinning of the DFPE approach is solid, combining established concepts in ensemble learning with novel adaptations specific to LLMs. - The experimental results support the claim of improved performance robustly, with clear metrics illustrating the advantages of the DFPE method over single model approaches. - The paper addresses a critical issue in LLM performance - the variability across different domains - and presents a structured solution. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive exploration of the specific characteristics of the clustering criteria and how they impact the choice of models. Including more qualitative analysis of the "fingerprints" could enhance understanding of model selection. - Real-world applicability of DFPE outside the benchmark context could be further demonstrated. Its practicality in production settings may differ, necessitating additional validation. - While it emphasizes improved accuracy, the paper could delve into the computational costs and complexities associated with implementing DFPE, as they may affect its attractiveness for practitioners. **Influence on the Field:** The DFPE method represents a significant advancement in the utilization of diverse models for enhanced performance in LLMs. It encourages further exploration into ensemble strategies tailored for LLMs, potentially influencing future research directions. However, practical challenges and the need for clarity on deployment scenarios may temper its immediate application. Considering these points, I would assign a score of **7**. The paper showcases a balance of novelty and practical applicability yet leaves room for deeper investigation into critical aspects of model dynamics, potential trade-offs, and real-world implementation challenges. **Score: 7**

In this paper, we propose a novel non-invasive EEG-based BCI system with Curriculum-based Neural Spelling Framework, which recognizes all 26 alphabet letters by decoding neural signals associated with handwriting first, and then apply a Generative AI (GenAI) to enhance spell-based neural language decoding tasks. Our approach combines the ease of handwriting with the accessibility of EEG technology, utilizing advanced neural decoding algorithms and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to translate EEG patterns into text with high accuracy. This system show how GenAI can improve the performance of typical spelling-based neural language decoding task, and addresses the limitations of previous methods, offering a scalable and user-friendly solution for individuals with communication impairments, thereby enhancing inclusive communication options.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel non-invasive EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system termed the Curriculum-based Neural Spelling Framework, which aims to decode all 26 letters of the alphabet from neural signals associated with handwriting. By integrating advanced neural decoding algorithms and generative AI technologies, the authors seek to enhance the performance of traditional spell-based neural language decoding tasks. This system targets individuals with communication impairments, improving their ability to communicate without physical action through precise translation of EEG data into text. **Evaluation:** This paper contributes significantly to the field of brain-computer interfaces, particularly in the realm of communication aids for individuals with disabilities. One of its primary strengths is the incorporation of a comprehensive framework capable of recognizing all alphabet letters, an advancement over prior systems that struggled with incomplete coverage. The integration of generative AI does bring a cutting-edge aspect to the discussion, showcasing how modern algorithms can enhance user experience and decoding accuracy. However, there are certain limitations worth noting. The paper primarily focuses on the technological advancements without providing substantial empirical evidence of effectiveness in real-world scenarios. While the theoretical framework is solid, the application to end-users and potential challenges in varied environments (often encountered in BCI systems) could have been discussed more thoroughly. Additionally, while the system's novelty lies in combining handwriting movements with EEG decoding and generative AI, similar concepts have been explored in isolated contexts, making it vital to clarify how this approach conclusively improves interactivity and accessibility. Overall, the system's potential for scalability and user-friendliness is commendable, making it a significant asset for the BCI community. However, its innovation must be demonstrated through rigorous testing with a diverse user base to verify claims of high accuracy and effectiveness. **Score: 7** Rationale: The score of 7 reflects a strong contribution to the field of BCI systems, particularly for communication aids, with notable advancements in the completeness of alphabet recognition and integration with generative AI. Nonetheless, the lack of extensive empirical validation and limited discussion on practical implementation detracts slightly from its overall impactful nature. Further exploration and data will solidify its standing as a truly transformative advancement in BCI technology.

### Query-Aware Learnable Graph Pooling Tokens as Prompt for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17549v1)
- **Authors**: Wooyoung Kim, Byungyoon Park, Wooju Kim
- **Abstract**: Graph-structured data plays a vital role in numerous domains, such as social networks, citation networks, commonsense reasoning graphs and knowledge graphs. While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex textual-attributed graph data.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel technique called the Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT) aimed at enhancing the integration of large language models in processing graph-structured data. LGPT introduces learnable parameters, functioning as tokens within language models to balance detailed node-level and overarching graph-level information, thus addressing challenges related to scalability and information loss in previous methodologies. The authors also propose an Early Query Fusion technique, which improves the quality of graph embeddings by integrating query context prior to building the graph representation. Their approach demonstrates a significant improvement in performance (4.13%) on the GraphQA benchmark without necessitating additional training for the language model, indicating its efficiency in managing complex textual-attributed graph data. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**: The main contribution of the LGPT approach lies in its dual focus on learnability and efficient representation of graph data while utilizing large language models. By introducing tokens that can learn representations specific to graph tasks, this work adds a layer of flexibility that is relatively underexplored in the intersection between graph neural networks and natural language processing. The idea of employing Early Query Fusion for improved context integration is an innovative twist that enhances its practical application. However, the novelty could be moderately challenged by existing methodologies that employ similar concepts in different contexts or structures without explicitly indicating that these strategies have been tested on graph data before. **Significance**: The significance of the paper is underscored by the robust performance enhancements reported on a recognized benchmark like GraphQA. This improvement without requiring the retraining of large language models is particularly advantageous, as it reduces computational requirements and increases accessibility for practitioners. Nevertheless, it's essential to note that while performance metrics are promising, the paper lacks comprehensive experimentation across a broader set of benchmarks, which would add to its reliability and understanding of how LGPT performs against various graph types. **Strengths**: 1. Introduces a promising method (LGPT) that merges graph processing with powerful language models efficiently. 2. Achieves noteworthy improvements on benchmark performance, establishing preliminary effectiveness. 3. Proposes an original framework that addresses two critical issues: scalability and information loss. **Weaknesses**: 1. Limited scope of experiments, focusing only on the GraphQA benchmark, might not present a complete picture of LGPT's generalizability. 2. The explanation of the methodologies could be more detailed to validate the robustness of the proposed techniques. 3. Comparisons with existing models beyond the presented benchmarks are necessary to fortify claims of superiority. Overall, the paper offers significant insights and tools to push forward the integration of language models into graph data processing, but its impact may be constrained by the current limitations in experimentation and validation.  **Score: 8**

### CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581v1)
- **Authors**: Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty
- **Abstract**: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "CSEval: Towards Automated, Multi-Dimensional, and Reference-Free Counterspeech Evaluation using Auto-Calibrated LLMs" addresses the challenges in evaluating automated counterspeech generation, an important task in combating online hate speech. Current evaluation methods are primarily based on similarity metrics, which fail to adequately assess various dimensions of counterspeech quality such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, argumentative coherence, and suitability. To tackle these issues, the authors present CSEval, a comprehensive dataset and evaluation framework focusing on these four dimensions. They introduce the Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a novel prompt-based solution utilizing auto-calibrated chain-of-thought mechanisms to enhance the scoring process of counterspeech generated by large language models. Experimental results show that ACE surpasses traditional evaluation metrics (ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore) in correlating with human judgment, signaling a significant improvement in this area of research. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty and significance of this paper lie in its multifaceted approach to counterspeech evaluation, addressing a notable gap in the existing literature. While automated evaluation methods for texts have seen considerable development, the specific application to counterspeech is relatively less explored. By proposing a comprehensive evaluation framework that breaks down counterspeech into distinct quality dimensions, the authors not only introduce a novel dataset but also create a new benchmark for future research in this domain. One significant strength of the paper is its empirical validation of the proposed method against standard evaluation metrics, demonstrating a clear improvement in alignment with human judgments. This introduces the potential for more efficient evaluation processes in a field that has relied heavily on human assessments, which can be labor-intensive and costly. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. The paper may benefit from a more extensive analysis of its dataset to understand the scope and diversity of examples presented. Moreover, the degree to which Auto-Calibrated CoT can be generalized across different cultural contexts and types of online discourse remains unclear. Additionally, while the results are promising, the paper could have benefited from comparative analyses with other emerging methods beyond traditional metrics, such as recent advances in adversarial evaluation frameworks. Given these factors, I assess the paper's contribution to be significant but accompanied by some limitations in scope and depth. Its framework for evaluating counterspeech is commendable and addresses a pressing need, but its applicability and robustness may require further validation in diverse settings. **Score: 8**

### Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models for Semi-supervised Sentiment Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17598v1)
- **Authors**: Kunrong Li, Xinyu Liu, Zhen Chen
- **Abstract**: Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment. However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task. Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit. Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis. We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information. The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction. Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training. Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem. Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis called Semantic Consistency Regularization (SCR) using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge of manually annotating sentiment data by introducing two prompting strategies to enhance unlabeled text: Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which focuses on extracting entities and numerical information for reconstruction, and Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which involves reconstructing the original sentence semantically. This augmented data is then used to establish a consistency loss, preserving high-quality sample agreements during training. Additionally, the authors propose a class re-assembling strategy aimed at efficiently utilizing uncertain unlabeled data. The experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves superior performance compared to existing semi-supervised methods. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper shows significant promise in addressing a pressing issue within NLP, particularly in sentiment analysis, where the manual creation of annotated corpora is economically and logistically challenging. The application of LLMs for enhancing unlabeled data reflects a strong understanding of the current capabilities of these models, and the dual enhancement strategies presented (SCR-EE and SCR-CE) are innovative contributions that leverage the strengths of LLMs. One of the noteworthy strengths of the paper is its rigorous experimental validation, which suggests that the proposed methods significantly outperform prior semi-supervised approaches. This not only asserts the effectiveness of the SCR framework but also adds to the ongoing discourse about employing LLMs in semi-supervised learning contexts. However, there are some weaknesses to consider. First, the method’s dependency on LLMs may limit its applicability to scenarios where computational resources are constrained, as LLMs can be expensive to deploy. Additionally, the paper could have benefited from a deeper exploration into how these enhancements generalize across different datasets or sentiment contexts, as the robustness of the approach across varying conditions remains to be seen. The paper might also lack a detailed discussion on potential ethical concerns related to the use of LLMs, such as biases in the generated text, which are significant in sentiment analysis. In summary, while the proposed framework is novel, effective, and provides a meaningful contribution to the field, its practical limitations and lack of broader applicability analysis must be considered. The evaluation of model performance across diverse contexts, along with potential ethical implications, could further strengthen its contributions. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Extended sequence generation often leads to degradation in contextual consistency due to the inability of conventional self-attention mechanisms to effectively retain long-range dependencies. Existing approaches, including memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning, introduce computational trade-offs that either increase inference latency or impose additional storage overhead. Structured Context Recomposition (SCR) introduces a probabilistic layer realignment strategy that dynamically adjusts learned representations within transformer layers, ensuring that semantically relevant embeddings persist throughout extended transformations. The proposed method enhances coherence retention through a recursive weighting function that redistributes representational emphasis based on inferred contextual relevance rather than relying on fixed token-level attention scores. Empirical results indicate that probabilistic realignment mitigates abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, particularly in scenarios where sequences exceed standard attention window constraints. Sequence-level entropy analysis further reveals that SCR moderates representational variability without introducing excessive output regularization, allowing models to sustain generative diversity while preserving contextual alignment. Attention head deviation measurements confirm that hierarchical reweighting contributes to smoother token dependency transitions across transformer layers, reinforcing the stability of multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning. Computational resource assessments show that while SCR incurs a moderate increase in processing time, memory overhead remains within feasible limits, making it suitable for practical deployment in autoregressive generative applications.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment" addresses the challenge of contextual inconsistency during extended sequence generation in large language models, particularly due to the limitations of conventional self-attention mechanisms in maintaining long-range dependencies. The authors introduce Structured Context Recomposition (SCR), a method that employs a probabilistic layer realignment strategy to dynamically modify learned representations within transformer layers. This technique focuses on preserving semantically relevant embeddings throughout extended transformations and enhances coherence retention by utilizing a recursive weighting function that prioritizes contextual relevance over fixed attention scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SCR reduces abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, particularly for sequences that exceed standard attention constraints. The method also stabilizes multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning, showcasing reduced representational variability without excessive regularization. While SCR comes with a moderate increase in processing time, it maintains acceptable memory usage, indicating its practical feasibility for generative applications. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The notion of dynamic realignment of embeddings as opposed to static attention scores is a significant step forward in addressing coherence in extended context generation. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides solid empirical results that showcase SCR's effectiveness in maintaining contextual consistency, which is a critical issue in current transformer architectures during long sequence generation. 3. **Practical Relevance:** Assessment of computational resource overhead indicates that SCR balances enhanced performance with practical deployment, making it feasible for real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Implementation:** While SCR offers theoretical advantages, its implementation may involve increased complexity in terms of model training and tuning, which could hinder adoption in some scenarios. 2. **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** The paper might benefit from a more extensive range of benchmarks and a comparative analysis against other state-of-the-art methods. While the results are promising, the lack of broader context may limit the perspective on SCR's relative performance. 3. **Processing Time Concerns:** Although the overhead is stated as being manageable, any increase in inference time can be a critical factor in high-demand applications, which may affect its reception in performance-sensitive areas. **Impact on the Field:** The paper's contribution is notably strong, addressing a prominent issue in NLP with a novel solution that highlights both theoretical and practical utility. If the framework's insights can be integrated into existing architectures, SCR could significantly influence future model designs, particularly for applications requiring deep contextual comprehension. **Score:** 8 **Justification:** The score reflects a recognition of the paper’s innovative approach and practical implications while also considering its shortcomings in implementation complexity and depth of evaluation. The contributions to coherent long-range dependency management are substantial; however, for a score of 9 or 10, further validation through wider benchmarks and community adoption would be necessary. Overall, it is a noteworthy contribution that enhances our understanding of sequence generation in language models.

- **Authors**: Sharon Temtsin, Diane Proudfoot, David Kaber, Christoph Bartneck
- **Abstract**: The current cycle of hype and anxiety concerning the benefits and risks to human society of Artificial Intelligence is fuelled, not only by the increasing use of generative AI and other AI tools by the general public, but also by claims made on behalf of such technology by popularizers and scientists. In particular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can "think". Large-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed examination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's original instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with GPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player imitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's instructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and conducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one participant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most advanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent extravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either optimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "The Imitation Game According to Turing" critiques current claims that Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4-Turbo, can pass the Turing Test. Motivated by the recent hype surrounding AI’s capabilities and societal implications, the authors argue that prior studies have misapplied Turing's original framework. They conducted a new, rigorous Turing Test that strictly adhered to Turing’s guidelines by implementing variations such as the Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) and the Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG). The results showed that nearly all participants could distinguish the LLM from human counterparts, indicating that current LLMs do not possess the capacity to "think" as previously claimed. The authors conclude that existing assertions of LLMs passing the Turing Test are unsubstantiated and caution against overconfidence regarding their societal impact. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper contributes to the field by addressing a significant misconception about LLMs and their purported capabilities regarding the Turing Test. It reflects on how AI discourse is often shaped by hype and claims that lack rigorous empirical backing. The authors’ adherence to Turing's original principles and their structured experimental methodology showcase both diligence and a clearer framework for evaluating AI behavior. **Strengths:** 1. **Rigorous Methodology:** The paper outlines a well-defined protocol, enhancing the reliability of the results by strictly following Turing’s original test criteria. 2. **Relevance:** This work is timely and relevant given the escalating tensions around AI capabilities and ethics in society. 3. **Critical Analysis of Prior Claims:** The authors effectively deconstruct prior studies claiming LLMs can pass the Turing Test, which is vital for academic discourse. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Test:** The study focuses on just one model, GPT-4-Turbo, which may limit the generalizability of the conclusions drawn about LLMs overall. 2. **Potential Bias in Test Design:** Although designed to align with Turing's ideas, the subjective nature of identifying a machine vs. a human may still introduce bias that is hard to quantify. 3. **Lack of Broader Context:** The implications of failure to pass the Turing Test could be discussed in terms of other AI functionalities beyond mere imitation. Due to the paper's clear methodological framework, its relevant critique of existing claims, and significant implications for the ongoing debate about AI capabilities, despite some limitations in scope and potential biases, it provides impactful insights into the capabilities of LLMs. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Wonbin Kweon, Sanghwan Jang, SeongKu Kang, Hwanjo Yu
- **Abstract**: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, we demonstrate that LLMs often exhibit uncertainty in their recommendations. To ensure the trustworthy use of LLMs in generating recommendations, we emphasize the importance of assessing the reliability of recommendations generated by LLMs. We start by introducing a novel framework for estimating the predictive uncertainty to quantitatively measure the reliability of LLM-based recommendations. We further propose to decompose the predictive uncertainty into recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty, enabling in-depth analyses of the primary source of uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, we (1) demonstrate predictive uncertainty effectively indicates the reliability of LLM-based recommendations, (2) investigate the origins of uncertainty with decomposed uncertainty measures, and (3) propose uncertainty-aware prompting for a lower predictive uncertainty and enhanced recommendation. Our source code and model weights are available at https://github.com/WonbinKweon/UNC_LLM_REC_WWW2025
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Uncertainty Quantification and Decomposition for LLM-based Recommendation" addresses the significant issue of uncertainty in recommendations generated by large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a novel framework for assessing predictive uncertainty in LLM-based recommendations by distinguishing between two types of uncertainty: recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty. This decomposition allows for a more thorough analysis of the sources of uncertainty affecting LLMs. The paper presents extensive experimental results demonstrating that predictive uncertainty effectively serves as a measure of recommendation reliability. The authors also introduce uncertainty-aware prompting strategies aimed at reducing predictive uncertainties and thereby improving recommendation quality. The paper's findings and methodologies are made accessible through shared source code and model weights. **Critical Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The exploration of uncertainty in LLM recommendations is highly relevant, given the increasing reliance on these models across various domains. The emphasis on reliability is crucial in applications where decision-making is affected by AI-generated recommendations. 2. **Novelty in Decomposition:** The decomposition of predictive uncertainty into distinct components (recommendation and prompt uncertainty) is a novel contribution that can lead to deeper insights into the mechanics of LLM performance. 3. **Experimental Approach:** The paper's extensive experimentation reinforces the claims made regarding the effectiveness of the proposed framework. This empirical validation is essential for establishing the practical utility of their approach. 4. **Open-source Contribution:** Providing source code and model weights promotes reproducibility and allows further research, which is a positive aspect in the academic community. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Contextualization:** While the study addresses an important topic, it could have benefited from a broader contextualization regarding existing methods of uncertainty quantification in recommendations, especially those specific to LLMs. 2. **Scope of Experiments:** Although the experiments demonstrate effectiveness, the paper would benefit from discussing scenarios where the proposed methods may not be as successful or could be challenged. 3. **Generalizability:** It is not clear how well the findings and methods apply to different types of LLMs or contexts outside of the specific datasets and scenarios tested. A broader generalizability assessment would strengthen the paper. **Conclusion:** The paper makes a noteworthy contribution by addressing an important aspect of LLM utilization—uncertainty in recommendations—through innovative framework development and empirical validation. While it faces limitations in context and assessment breadth, the findings have the potential to influence practices in the application of LLMs significantly. **Score: 8**

### In-Context Meta LoRA Generation

- **Authors**: Yihua Shao, Minxi Yan, Yang Liu, Siyu Chen, Wenjie Chen, Xinwei Long, Ziyang Yan, Lei Li, Chenyu Zhang, Nicu Sebe, Hao Tang, Yan Wang, Hao Zhao, Mengzhu Wang, Jingcai Guo
- **Abstract**: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "In-Context Meta LoRA Generation" addresses inefficiencies in using Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) across multiple tasks. Traditional methods require individual LoRA models for each task, leading to increased storage and inference costs. The authors propose a novel approach called In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), which uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to generate task-specific LoRA weights based on task descriptions. This method combines training data from multiple tasks, allowing for the generation of tailored weights that fine-tune LLMs without the need for extensive retraining. Moreover, the approach incorporates in-context meta-learning to enhance knowledge transfer and better capture the relationships between tasks, resulting in improved accuracy for LoRA parameter generation. The proposed method significantly reduces storage requirements, occupying only 283MB, which is just 1% compared to traditional LoRA systems. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in the introduction of the ICM-LoRA framework, which integrates CVAE for generating LoRA weights in a more efficient and task-aware manner. This is a relevant contribution to the evolving field of model fine-tuning, particularly in the context of LLMs, where multi-task performance is increasingly important. The suggestion to employ in-context meta-learning is also noteworthy because it leverages relationships between multiple tasks, which is often overlooked in traditional approaches. However, the paper's novelty could be further strengthened by providing more substantial empirical evidence comparing ICM-LoRA with existing methods beyond just storage metrics. The evaluation could include more extensive performance benchmarks across a wider range of tasks, thereby providing a clearer picture of the effectiveness and robustness of their proposed method. The authors could also discuss potential limitations or trade-offs involved with their approach, which seems largely absent in the current narrative. In terms of significance, the reduction in storage size (to 1% of the original LoRA implementation) is quite impactful, especially in scenarios where resources are constrained. This aspect can facilitate the adoption of advanced LLM techniques in low-resource environments. Yet, the real-world implications and practical applications of integrating this proposed method into existing workflows or systems remain underexplored in the discussion.  The paper represents a commendable step towards addressing inefficiencies in multi-task model adaptations, but the impact would be enhanced by more thorough evaluations and discussions. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects good innovation and practical significance, while also acknowledging the need for broader validation and deeper exploration of its limitations and applications. **Score: 7**

### Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17670v1)
- **Authors**: Wenyu Mao, Shuchang Liu, Haoyang Liu, Haozhe Liu, Xiang Li, Lanatao Hu
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have emerged as promising approaches for sequential recommendation due to their strong ability to model data distributions and generate high-quality items. Existing work typically adds noise to the next item and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence, generating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify two key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous in length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using such sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user interests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the popular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the personalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation (DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests and generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To extract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ) to quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and category interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better understand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff personalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM), which maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive loss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments are conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four widely-used datasets. The superior recommendation performance of DiQDiff against leading approaches demonstrates its effectiveness in sequential recommendation tasks.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Distinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation" presents a novel approach called Distinguished Quantized Guidance (DiQDiff) tailored for enhancing sequential recommendation systems using diffusion models (DMs). The authors identify limitations in existing methods, such as the variability in user interaction sequences and the bias towards popular items due to stochastic behaviors in user actions. To overcome these challenges, DiQDiff introduces two key innovations:  1. **Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ)**: This technique is utilized to convert user interaction sequences into semantic vectors that capture collaborative signals and category interests. This quantization is facilitated by a codebook, aiming to provide a richer and more robust understanding of user preferences. 2. **Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM)**: By maximizing the distance between generations of items, CDM addresses the issue of bias in generated recommendations, ensuring that diverse and personalized items are offered to users based on their unique interests. The effectiveness of DiQDiff is validated through extensive experiments, showcasing its superior performance over several baseline models across four widely-used datasets in the realm of sequential recommendations.  ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** DiQDiff introduces significant advancements in leveraging diffusion models for personalized recommendations. The use of SVQ to represent user interactions through semantic vectors is a noteworthy novelty as it enhances the interpretability of user interests significantly compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, the application of CDM to mitigate generation bias is an innovative approach that addresses a well-known issue in recommender systems. **Significance:** The paper has substantial implications for the recommender systems community, proposing a thoughtful solution to two pressing issues: heterogeneous user interactions and the generation of biased recommendations. This work is likely to influence future research directions by highlighting the importance of addressing data bias and enhancing user personalization. **Strengths:** 1. The paper constructs a solid theoretical foundation for its methods. 2. It offers empirical results that demonstrate DiQDiff's effectiveness, thus establishing credibility. 3. The proposed methods for extracting robust guidance and personalizing recommendations are well-conceived and executed. **Weaknesses:** 1. While the paper addresses significant issues, the methodology could provide more intuitive explanations or illustrations of how SVQ and CDM work in practical settings, which would benefit less technical audiences. 2. The scope of experiments could be expanded to include more datasets and comparisons with newer state-of-the-art models to validate the generalizability of the findings. **Overall Influence:** The methods and findings presented in the paper contribute valuable insights to the fields of machine learning and recommendation systems, particularly in enhancing personalization using advanced modeling techniques. Based on these factors, I assess the paper's contribution to be significant but not without its limitations. Therefore, while it represents a strong advancement in the field, there is room for further exploration and validation. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: We introduce a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework called generative reinforcement network (GRN) that integrates segmentation loss feedback to optimize both image generation and segmentation performance in a single stage. An image enhancement technique called segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) is also developed, where the generator produces images tailored specifically for the segmentation model. Two variants of GRN were also developed, including GRN for sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and GRN for semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). GRN's performance was evaluated using a dataset of 69 fully annotated 3D ultrasound scans from 29 subjects. The annotations included six anatomical structures: dermis, superficial fat, superficial fascial membrane (SFM), deep fat, deep fascial membrane (DFM), and muscle. Our results show that GRN-SEL with SGE reduces labeling efforts by up to 70% while achieving a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) compared to models trained on fully labeled datasets. GRN-SEL alone reduces labeling efforts by 60%, GRN-SSL with SGE decreases labeling requirements by 70%, and GRN-SSL alone by 60%, all while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised models. These findings suggest the effectiveness of the GRN framework in optimizing segmentation performance with significantly less labeled data, offering a scalable and efficient solution for ultrasound image analysis and reducing the burdens associated with data annotation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper proposes a novel segmentation-aware joint training framework termed the Generative Reinforcement Network (GRN), designed to improve tissue layer segmentation in 3-D ultrasound images for assessing chronic low-back pain (cLBP). The GRN leverages segmentation loss feedback to enhance both image generation and segmentation performance cohesively. It introduces a segmentation-guided enhancement (SGE) method to specifically optimize generated images for the segmentation model. The study presents two GRN variants: one focused on sample-efficient learning (GRN-SEL) and another on semi-supervised learning (GRN-SSL). Utilizing a dataset of 69 annotated 3D ultrasound scans encompassing six anatomical structures, the results reveal that GRN-SEL with SGE achieves a 1.98% improvement in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) while reducing labeling efforts by up to 70%. The framework's ability to maintain performance comparable to fully supervised models with significantly reduced labeled data highlights its potential as a scalable solution in ultrasound image analysis. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Originality:**  The GRN framework combines generative models with reinforcement learning principles, utilizing segmentation-aware training, which is relatively unique. The introduction of segmentation-guided enhancement also presents an innovative approach to tailor images for segmentation, adding a significant dimension to standard generative networks. However, while generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning are established methods in computer vision, their integration with segmentation tasks in ultrasound imagery is less common, marking a noteworthy contribution. **Methodology:**  The methodology involves leveraging two learning paradigms, sample-efficient learning and semi-supervised learning, to combat the challenges associated with extensive labeling. This approach underscores the practical issues surrounding data annotation in medical imaging, which is a critical concern in the field. **Results and Impact:**  The reported decrease in labeling efforts and improvement in segmentation accuracy is compelling, indicating that the GRN framework could transform practices in ultrasound imaging by minimizing the labor involved with data annotation. However, the paper lacks extensive real-world applicability testing and reproducibility assessments, which would enhance its validation. Furthermore, the sample size used for evaluation (69 scans) could be viewed as a limitation in establishing the robustness of the findings. **Field Influence:**  The work has the potential to influence future research directions in medical imaging. By showcasing a method that effectively balances annotation effort against performance, it might encourage further studies to explore similar integrated approaches in other domains. However, the extent of its influence will depend on broader validation in larger datasets and various clinical settings. **Strengths and Weaknesses:**  Strengths include the innovative integration of generative networks and reinforcement learning that optimally addresses a real-world issue in medical imaging. The focus on reducing labeling efforts while maintaining accuracy is highly relevant. Conversely, the limitations concerning sample size, lack of extensive testing across diverse datasets, and possible overfitting in the presented results may hinder broader adoption of the technique. **Score Justification:**  In weighing the novelty and significance of the contributions against its limitations and the rigorous requirements for clinical utility, I assign this paper a score of **7**. While the GRN framework shows promise and presents a fresh perspective on addressing labeling issues in medical imaging, further validation and testing are required to firmly establish its impact and robustness.

### RICoTA: Red-teaming of In-the-wild Conversation with Test Attempts
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17715v1)
- **Authors**: Eujeong Choi, Younghun Jeong, Soomin Kim, Won Ik Cho
- **Abstract**: User interactions with conversational agents (CAs) evolve in the era of heavily guardrailed large language models (LLMs). As users push beyond programmed boundaries to explore and build relationships with these systems, there is a growing concern regarding the potential for unauthorized access or manipulation, commonly referred to as "jailbreaking." Moreover, with CAs that possess highly human-like qualities, users show a tendency toward initiating intimate sexual interactions or attempting to tame their chatbots. To capture and reflect these in-the-wild interactions into chatbot designs, we propose RICoTA, a Korean red teaming dataset that consists of 609 prompts challenging LLMs with in-the-wild user-made dialogues capturing jailbreak attempts. We utilize user-chatbot conversations that were self-posted on a Korean Reddit-like community, containing specific testing and gaming intentions with a social chatbot. With these prompts, we aim to evaluate LLMs' ability to identify the type of conversation and users' testing purposes to derive chatbot design implications for mitigating jailbreaking risks. Our dataset will be made publicly available via GitHub.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces RICoTA, a novel dataset aimed at red-teaming conversational agents (CAs) to better understand user interactions that seek to manipulate or "jailbreak" large language models (LLMs). Particularly focusing on a Korean context, the dataset comprises 609 user-generated prompts that exemplify attempts to exploit CAs’ boundaries, derived from a community sharing platform similar to Reddit. By analyzing these interactions, the authors seek to enhance the design of CAs to effectively recognize and address manipulation attempts, thereby improving safety and user experience. The dataset will be made publicly available for further research. **Evaluation:** The paper's novelty lies in its focus on real-world interactions with conversational agents, a significant step in addressing the challenges posed by increasingly sophisticated user attempts to manipulate AI. The collection of a specialized dataset highlights the emergence of user-driven testing behaviors in this domain, which is an underrepresented aspect in current LLM research. By situating this work within a cultural context (Korea), it may yield unique insights that inform more culturally aware design practices. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Real-world focus**: The dataset reflects authentic user interactions rather than contrived examples, which is critical for studying actual vulnerabilities in CAs. 2. **Specificity and academic contribution**: The targeted theme of jailbreaking and the intent of user prompts introduce meaningful implications for CA safety and design. 3. **Public availability of data**: Making the dataset accessible encourages collaboration and further research, promoting advancements in chatbot design and safety. However, some weaknesses can be identified: 1. **Limited scope**: The regional focus on Korean interactions may restrict the applicability of findings to other languages and cultures, potentially limiting the generalizability of the results. 2. **Depth of analysis**: While the dataset is significant, the paper could strengthen its impact by providing in-depth analyses of specific cases or by including comparative studies with similar datasets in other contexts. 3. **Potential ethical considerations**: The implications of crafting datasets from user interactions raise questions about privacy and consent that are not discussed in detail. In summation, while the paper provides valuable insights and contributes a useful resource to the field, the limitations in scope and depth curb its potential impact. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 7 to reflect its notable contributions against the existing landscape of research in conversational agents while acknowledging areas for further exploration. **Score: 7**

### Using Code Generation to Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17725v1)
- **Authors**: Christopher D. Rosin
- **Abstract**: The Handbook of Combinatorial Designs catalogs many types of combinatorial designs, together with lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been determined. We develop a constructive protocol CPro1, which uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code that constructs combinatorial designs and resolves some of these open instances. The protocol starts from a definition of a particular type of design, and a verifier that reliably confirms whether a proposed design is valid. The LLM selects strategies and implements them in code, and scaffolding provides automated hyperparameter tuning and execution feedback using the verifier. Most generated code fails, but by generating many candidates, the protocol automates exploration of a variety of standard methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) and experimentation with variations (e.g. cost functions) to find successful approaches. Testing on 16 different types of designs, CPro1 constructs solutions to open instances for 6 of them: Symmetric and Skew Weighing Matrices, Equidistant Permutation Arrays, Packing Arrays, Balanced Ternary Designs, and Florentine Rectangles.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Using Code Generation to Solve Open Instances of Combinatorial Design Problems" introduces a novel protocol called CPro1, which employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code for constructing combinatorial designs. This protocol addresses some unresolved instances documented in the Handbook of Combinatorial Designs by automating the exploration of design strategies and their implementation in code. Each design type is defined alongside a reliable verifier to assess design validity. While most generated codes do not succeed, the approach benefits from the generation of a large number of candidates, permitting the automatic testing of various methods (like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms) and adjustments to parameters. The protocol tests 16 design types and successfully resolves 6 open instances, suggesting a promising application in combinatorial designs. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The use of LLMs for code generation in the realm of combinatorial designs is a notable innovation. The integration of LLMs with automated hyperparameter tuning and the innovative exploration of multiple strategies marks a shift in how such problems can be approached, particularly by leveraging machine learning techniques. This aspect constitutes a novel intersection between artificial intelligence and combinatorial optimization. **Strengths**: 1. **Methodology**: The method of using LLMs to explore combinatorial design solutions is unique and demonstrates a creative approach to a traditionally computationally hard problem. 2. **Success Rate**: The fact that CPro1 managed to resolve instances that were previously open illustrates its potential efficacy and utility. 3. **Exploratory Capability**: By generating multiple candidates and applying automation, it showcases a proactive way of tackling combinatorial problems that could be beneficial for future research. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Failure Rate**: While generating many code candidates increases the chances of success, the high failure rate of generated code may pose reliability concerns. More data or improvements in the LLM’s training might be necessary to enhance the success rate. 2. **Scalability and Generalization**: The study only tests a finite set of designs. It remains to be seen how well the protocol scales with more complex designs or broader applications outside the tested categories. 3. **Verification Dependence**: The approach relies heavily on the validity of the verifier. If the verifier has shortcomings, it may lead to false positives in determining successful designs. **Significance**: The paper is significant as it pushes the boundaries of computational combinatorics by integrating advanced machine learning techniques. It can motivate further research on using LLMs and automated processes within combinatorial optimization and design problems, establishing a foundation for expanding their application across different optimization problems. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper presents a commendable effort in bridging combinatorial design problems with current machine learning capabilities. However, the inherent challenges, particularly in code reliability and verification, should be addressed for the findings to hold greater validity and applicability. **Score: 8** - The score reflects strong novelty and significance in applying LLMs to combinatorial design, balanced against the challenges related to code reliability and the scope of testing.

### VICCA: Visual Interpretation and Comprehension of Chest X-ray Anomalies in Generated Report Without Human Feedback
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17726v1)
- **Authors**: Sayeh Gholipour Picha, Dawood Al Chanti, Alice Caplier
- **Abstract**: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly central to healthcare, the demand for explainable and trustworthy models is paramount. Current report generation systems for chest X-rays (CXR) often lack mechanisms for validating outputs without expert oversight, raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework designed to enhance the semantic alignment and localization accuracy of AI-generated medical reports. Our framework integrates two key modules: a Phrase Grounding Model, which identifies and localizes pathologies in CXR images based on textual prompts, and a Text-to-Image Diffusion Module, which generates synthetic CXR images from prompts while preserving anatomical fidelity. By comparing features between the original and generated images, we introduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy, while the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology localization and text-to-image alignment. The integration of phrase grounding with diffusion models, coupled with the dual-scoring evaluation system, provides a robust mechanism for validating report quality, paving the way for more trustworthy and transparent AI in medical imaging.

Results demonstrate significant improvements over previous models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly localization and text-image alignment. This framework offers a promising step towards more trustworthy AI in medical imaging, facilitating better quality validation of automated pathology reports. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper presents a somewhat novel approach by integrating phrase grounding with diffusion models in the specific context of chest X-ray report generation. The dual-scoring system adds an innovative layer of evaluation that is not commonly discussed in similar literature, addressing a critical gap related to the validation of AI outputs. However, while the components (phrase grounding and diffusion models) have been explored in separate contexts previously, their combined application in medical imaging provides a fresh perspective. Overall, the novelty is moderate, as it builds on established concepts rather than introducing entirely new ideas. **Significance:** The significance of this work is underscored by the increasing reliance on AI in healthcare, where trust and interpretability are major concerns. The proposed framework aims to mitigate the risks associated with automated report generation by enhancing semantic alignment and localization accuracy—essential factors in clinical settings. The potential implications for improving patient outcomes and facilitating more reliable diagnostics are substantial. Furthermore, the emphasis on explainability aligns well with current trends in AI ethics. **Strengths:** - Combines established techniques in a unique framework tailored for medical imaging. - The proposed dual-scoring system provides a robust method for evaluating AI outputs, addressing a significant limitation in current literature. - Achieves state-of-the-art results in both pathology localization and text-image alignment, indicating strong empirical validation. **Weaknesses:** - The reliance on existing models may dampen the perceived novelty, as it does not significantly shift theoretical paradigms but rather enhances practical applications. - The evaluation of the models should ideally include a broader range of clinical scenarios to validate the robustness of the approach in diverse medical contexts. **Potential Influence:** The framework has the potential to significantly impact the field of medical imaging by paving the way for more reliable AI systems. If adopted in clinical practice, it could enhance the interpretability of AI-generated reports, thereby improving clinician confidence in automated tools. ### Score: 7 Rationale: The paper represents a meaningful step towards integrating explainability in AI-generated medical reports, addressing critical gaps in reliability and interpretability. However, while it introduces useful innovations, its dependency on previously established methodologies and the absence of groundbreaking theoretical contributions moderate its novelty. The overall significance and potential impact on the field remain strong, contributing to a score of 7.

### Sparse Autoencoders Can Interpret Randomly Initialized Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17727v1)
- **Authors**: Thomas Heap, Tim Lawson, Lucy Farnik, Laurence Aitchison
- **Abstract**: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are an increasingly popular technique for interpreting the internal representations of transformers. In this paper, we apply SAEs to 'interpret' random transformers, i.e., transformers where the parameters are sampled IID from a Gaussian rather than trained on text data. We find that random and trained transformers produce similarly interpretable SAE latents, and we confirm this finding quantitatively using an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline. Further, we find that SAE quality metrics are broadly similar for random and trained transformers. We find that these results hold across model sizes and layers. We discuss a number of number interesting questions that this work raises for the use of SAEs and auto-interpretability in the context of mechanistic interpretability.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents an exploration of using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to interpret the representations of transformers that have been initialized randomly, as opposed to those that are trained on text data. The authors demonstrate that both random and trained transformers produce similarly interpretable latent representations when analyzed with SAEs. Their findings are corroborated with quantitative analyses using an open-source auto-interpretability pipeline and suggest that SAE quality metrics are consistent across varying degrees of model training. The authors also highlight several intriguing questions raised by their results pertaining to the mechanistic interpretability of neural networks, particularly regarding the implications of using SAEs in understanding transformer models. **Critical Evaluation**:  **Novelty**: The paper brings an interesting perspective to the interpretability of transformers by examining the difference (or lack thereof) between trained and random models through Sparse Autoencoders. While prior research has explored interpretability and random initializations separately, this study bridges both topics in a novel way. However, using random initializations to interpret model behaviors has been touched upon in previous works. Thus, the novelty is moderate—bringing new insights but not groundbreaking ones. **Significance**: The significance of the paper lies in demonstrating that the internal representations of transformers can be interpretable even without training on data. This might have implications for understanding why transformers can perform well in tasks despite seemingly arbitrary initial parameters. Additionally, it opens avenues for mechanistic interpretability research, which is a hot topic in AI. However, the findings need to be contextualized within broader literature to gauge the true impact. **Strengths**: 1. **Methodological Rigor**: The use of a well-defined interpretability pipeline adds credibility to the results. 2. **Broad Applicability**: The consistent results across various model sizes and layers suggest robust conclusions that could apply widely. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Novel Insight**: While the findings are interesting, the incremental nature of the research may not yield transformative advancements in the interpretability field. 2. **Scope of Investigation**: The paper could have further enriched discussions around the implications of these findings on real-world applications or in contrast to various other interpretability methods. Overall, while the research presents valuable insights into the interpretability landscape surrounding transformers, its contribution is more incremental than groundbreaking. The novelty is moderate, and while it raises significant questions for future exploration, it may not have immediate applications. **Score: 6**

### Dynamics of Transient Structure in In-Context Linear Regression Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17745v1)
- **Authors**: Liam Carroll, Jesse Hoogland, Matthew Farrugia-Roberts, Daniel Murfet
- **Abstract**: Modern deep neural networks display striking examples of rich internal computational structure. Uncovering principles governing the development of such structure is a priority for the science of deep learning. In this paper, we explore the transient ridge phenomenon: when transformers are trained on in-context linear regression tasks with intermediate task diversity, they initially behave like ridge regression before specializing to the tasks in their training distribution. This transition from a general solution to a specialized solution is revealed by joint trajectory principal component analysis. Further, we draw on the theory of Bayesian internal model selection to suggest a general explanation for the phenomena of transient structure in transformers, based on an evolving tradeoff between loss and complexity. This explanation is grounded in empirical measurements of model complexity using the local learning coefficient.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper "Dynamics of Transient Structure in In-Context Linear Regression Transformers" investigates the transient ridge phenomenon observed in transformers trained on varying in-context linear regression tasks. Initially, these models perform similarly to ridge regression, suggesting a generalization phase. Over time, they adapt to the specific tasks they are exposed to during training. The transition from general solutions to specialized ones is analyzed using joint trajectory principal component analysis. The authors offer a theoretical framework for this behavior through the lens of Bayesian internal model selection, emphasizing a dynamic balance between loss minimization and model complexity, which they substantiate with empirical data reflecting the local learning coefficient. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper explores a relatively underexamined aspect of transformer training dynamics—how these models transition from general to specialized behavior. It introduces the transient ridge phenomenon, drawing parallels with ridge regression, which is an insightful contribution to understanding the internal workings of transformers. Additionally, the application of Bayesian model selection offers a fresh theoretical perspective on this transition. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Analysis**: The incorporation of principal component analysis to visualize the model's transition is a solid methodological choice, providing clear evidence for the authors' claims. 2. **Theoretical Framework**: Grounding the findings in Bayesian internal model selection leads to a well-founded explanation of the observed behaviors, potentially aiding future research in understanding deep learning dynamics. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Application**: While the findings are novel within the specific context of in-context linear regression and transformers, the broader implications for different model architectures or training tasks are not sufficiently discussed, limiting the generalizability of the conclusions. 2. **Complexity Measurement**: The paper's reliance on the local learning coefficient to define model complexity could be more robust—alternative metrics might provide a more nuanced understanding of the complexity-loss tradeoff. **Influence on the Field**: This paper opens a conversation about transient behaviors in deep learning models, specifically transformers, significantly impacting future research directions. If further validated across different tasks and models, it could enhance our understanding of how these models can be effectively trained and utilized. **Score**: 8 This score reflects the paper's strong contributions to the field, its insightful theoretical framing, and its potential implications for future research directions, despite some limitations in scope and robustness of complexity measurement.

- **Authors**: Aitor Arrieta, Miriam Ugarte, Pablo Valle, José Antonio Parejo, Sergio Segura
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, they impose certain risks, including those that can harm individuals' privacy, perpetuate biases and spread misinformation. These risks highlight the need for robust safety mechanisms, ethical guidelines, and thorough testing to ensure their responsible deployment. Safety of LLMs is a key property that needs to be thoroughly tested prior the model to be deployed and accessible to the general users. This paper reports the external safety testing experience conducted by researchers from Mondragon University and University of Seville on OpenAI's new o3-mini LLM as part of OpenAI's early access for safety testing program. In particular, we apply our tool, ASTRAL, to automatically and systematically generate up to date unsafe test inputs (i.e., prompts) that helps us test and assess different safety categories of LLMs. We automatically generate and execute a total of 10,080 unsafe test input on a early o3-mini beta version. After manually verifying the test cases classified as unsafe by ASTRAL, we identify a total of 87 actual instances of unsafe LLM behavior. We highlight key insights and findings uncovered during the pre-deployment external testing phase of OpenAI's latest LLM.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Early External Safety Testing of OpenAI's o3-mini: Insights from the Pre-Deployment Evaluation" addresses the pressing concerns surrounding the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recognizing the potential harms these models can cause—including privacy breaches, the perpetuation of biases, and misinformation—the study emphasizes the importance of thorough safety assessments before deployment. The authors detail their experience in conducting external safety testing on OpenAI's o3-mini LLM in collaboration with Mondragon University and University of Seville, utilizing the ASTRAL tool to systematically generate unsafe test prompts. This method led to the execution of over 10,000 test inputs, revealing 87 instances of unsafe behavior after manual verification. The findings underscore vital insights about LLM safety, contributing to the discourse on responsible deployment of AI technologies. --- ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The paper addresses current and urgent issues regarding the safety and ethical implications of LLMs, a topic that is increasingly pertinent as these models are integrated into various applications. 2. **Methodological Innovation**: By developing and applying the ASTRAL tool, the authors contribute a systematic approach to identifying unsafe behaviors in LLMs. This presents a significant methodological advancement in the field of AI safety testing. 3. **Empirical Findings**: The identification of specific instances of unsafe behavior enhances the existing body of knowledge about LLM limitations and areas needing improvement. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Contextual Limitations**: The study focuses solely on the o3-mini model, which may limit the generalizability of its findings to other LLMs or variations in model architecture. 2. **Depth of Analysis**: While the study reports a significant number of unsafe behaviors, there is little discussion regarding the implications of these behaviors or how they can inform broader safety strategies across various models. 3. **Scope of Testing**: Although the authors executed a substantial number of test inputs, the paper does not elaborate on the criteria used to classify these inputs as "unsafe," leaving some ambiguity around the rigor of the safety testing process. **Conclusion**: Overall, while the paper makes a meaningful contribution to the ongoing conversation around LLM safety and demonstrates innovative methods for assessment, its scope and depth may limit its impact. The focus on a single model and insufficiently detailed analysis of implications for broader safety practices are notable drawbacks. Nonetheless, the immediate relevance of the topic and methodological advancements warrant a strong score. **Score: 7**

### Hybrid Graphs for Table-and-Text based Question Answering using LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17767v1)
- **Authors**: Ankush Agarwal, Ganesh S, Chaitanya Devaguptapu
- **Abstract**: Answering questions that require reasoning and aggregation across both structured (tables) and unstructured (raw text) data sources presents significant challenges. Current methods rely on fine-tuning and high-quality, human-curated data, which is difficult to obtain. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results for multi-hop question answering (QA) over single-source text data in a zero-shot setting, yet exploration into multi-source Table-Text QA remains limited. In this paper, we present a novel Hybrid Graph-based approach for Table-Text QA that leverages LLMs without fine-tuning. Our method constructs a unified Hybrid Graph from textual and tabular data, pruning information based on the input question to provide the LLM with relevant context concisely. We evaluate our approach on the challenging Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets using state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and LLaMA-3. Our method achieves the best zero-shot performance on both datasets, improving Exact Match scores by up to 10% on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Moreover, our approach reduces token usage by up to 53% compared to the original context.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a Hybrid Graph-based method for Question Answering (QA) that integrates both structured (tables) and unstructured (text) data sources to tackle the complexities of multi-source Table-Text QA. Unlike traditional approaches that typically require fine-tuning on high-quality, human-annotated datasets, this method utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in a zero-shot capacity, constructing a Hybrid Graph that consolidates relevant information derived from both data types based on the specific question at hand. The approach demonstrates significant improvements in performance on the Hybrid-QA and OTT-QA datasets, achieving the highest scores in zero-shot settings, with an increase of up to 10% in Exact Match scores on Hybrid-QA and 5.4% on OTT-QA. Furthermore, it enhances computational efficiency by reducing token usage by up to 53%. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of the paper lies in its innovative integration of tables and text through Hybrid Graph structures while utilizing LLMs without requiring pre-training adjustments. This is significant in the context of previous work, as it addresses the dual-source QA challenges effectively without the dependency on extensive, curated training datasets, which are often difficult to obtain, thereby broadening the applicability of LLMs in multi-source environments. **Strengths:** 1. **Methodological Innovation:** The Hybrid Graph approach is a notable advancement in merging data types for improved QA performance. 2. **Zero-shot Learning Advantage:** By demonstrating robust results without fine-tuning, it showcases the adaptability of LLMs, which can be beneficial for real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. 3. **Performance Metrics:** The improvements in Exact Match scores and significant reduction in token usage demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns:** While the method shows promising results on specific datasets, its applicability to broader datasets or real-world scenarios with varying data quality and structure remains to be fully scrutinized. 2. **Limited Dataset Evaluation:** Relying primarily on two datasets may restrict the generalizability of the findings. Future work should involve diverse datasets to assess the robustness of the approach. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a commendable contribution to the field of Table-and-Text QA, addressing important challenges while leveraging modern language processing capabilities. It holds potential implications for both academic research and practical applications in domains that require efficient querying of multi-source information. Score: 8

### 2SSP: A Two-Stage Framework for Structured Pruning of LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17771v1)
- **Authors**: Fabrizio Sandri, Elia Cunegatti, Giovanni Iacca
- **Abstract**: We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (2SSP) for pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different strategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width Pruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns, aiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the intermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This is done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron over the output magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire Attention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that removes the Attention submodules with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in our case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the sparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test 2SSP on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\%, 37.5\%, and 50\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets as well as the performance over six downstream tasks. Our method consistently outperforms five state-of-the-art competitors over three language modeling and six downstream tasks, with an up to two-order-of-magnitude gain in terms of pruning time. The code is available at available at \url{https://github.com/FabrizioSandri/2SSP}.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs), referred to as 2SSP. It entails two main phases of pruning:  1. **Width Pruning**: This first stage focuses on removing entire neurons, which helps maintain structural connectivity in the Feed-Forward Networks within Transformer architecture. Neurons are evaluated and pruned based on an importance score, which indicates their effect on the model's output magnitude. 2. **Depth Pruning**: In this stage, entire Attention submodules are removed iteratively, targeting those that exert the least impact on model performance, as measured by perplexity. The framework also introduces a method to regulate the sparsity level across the two stages, aligning it with an overall desired sparsity target. The evaluation is conducted on four families of LLMs and three different sparsity rates (25%, 37.5%, and 50%). Results show that 2SSP outperforms five current state-of-the-art pruning strategies in terms of perplexity over three language modeling datasets and performance across six downstream tasks. Additionally, the method achieves significant improvements in pruning efficiency. The corresponding code is accessible online. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths**: - **Innovative Pruning Approach**: The dual-phase method of pruning (Width and Depth) represents a novel approach within the landscape of model compression techniques for LLMs, as most existing methods do not leverage complementary strategies in such a structured manner. - **Empirical Results**: The extensive evaluation across various models, sparsity rates, and tasks provides robust evidence of the method's effectiveness and efficiency, indicating a well-rounded assessment. - **Practical Implications**: The reported speedup in pruning time (up to two orders of magnitude) could have significant implications for practitioners looking to optimize model performance and deployment speed. **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Theoretical Insights**: While the empirical results are strong, the paper could benefit from a deeper theoretical explanation of why the combination of Width and Depth Pruning specifically yields better results compared to existing techniques. - **Generality of Results**: The focus on just four LLM families might limit the generalizability of the claims about the method's effectiveness. Future work should aim to test the framework on a broader range of models. - **Metrics Used**: The reliance primarily on perplexity as a performance indicator may not fully encapsulate the operational effectiveness of a language model in real-world applications, where task-specific metrics could provide additional insight. **Potential Influence**: Given the current trend towards optimizing LLMs for efficiency while maintaining performance, 2SSP could position itself as a valuable tool for researchers and developers. However, its impact will depend on further validations across diverse tasks and datasets to solidify its theoretical underpinnings and broaden its applicability. ### Score: 7 **Rationale**: The paper presents a notable advance in model pruning methodology, showing clear empirical success and practical application relevance. However, it lacks comprehensive theoretical insights and broader validations, limiting its exceptional impact. The score of 7 reflects a solid contribution that stands out in the field but acknowledges areas for further development to achieve greater influence.

- **Authors**: Peter Pak, Amir Barati Farimani
- **Abstract**: In this work we investigate the ability of large language models to predict additive manufacturing defect regimes given a set of process parameter inputs. For this task we utilize a process parameter defect dataset to fine-tune a collection of models, titled AdditiveLLM, for the purpose of predicting potential defect regimes including Keyholing, Lack of Fusion, and Balling. We compare different methods of input formatting in order to gauge the model's performance to correctly predict defect regimes on our sparse Baseline dataset and our natural language Prompt dataset. The model displays robust predictive capability, achieving an accuracy of 93\% when asked to provide the defect regimes associated with a set of process parameters. The incorporation of natural language input further simplifies the task of process parameters selection, enabling users to identify optimal settings specific to their build.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "AdditiveLLM: Large Language Models Predict Defects in Additive Manufacturing" explores the application of large language models (LLMs) to predict defect regimes in additive manufacturing based on process parameter inputs. By fine-tuning a collection of models dubbed AdditiveLLM on a dedicated defect dataset, the authors aim to forecast defects such as Keyholing, Lack of Fusion, and Balling. The study evaluates various input formatting strategies to determine their impact on prediction accuracy. Notably, the model achieves an impressive accuracy of 93% in predicting defect regimes and demonstrates enhanced usability through the incorporation of natural language inputs, which streamlines the selection of optimal process parameters for manufacturing settings. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**   The application of LLMs to predict defects in a specific industrial domain like additive manufacturing is a relatively new intersection of fields—merging advanced machine learning techniques with practical engineering challenges. Although using LLMs in other contexts (e.g., text generation, summarization) is established, their tailored adaptation for defect prediction is a notable contribution.  **Significance:**   The significance of this work lies in its potential to impact the efficiency and effectiveness of additive manufacturing processes. The high accuracy reported suggests that these models could assist practitioners in diagnosing and mitigating production issues, thus promoting better quality control and potentially reducing waste. Additionally, the option for users to input parameters via natural language enhances accessibility and usability for those without technical expertise in data analysis. **Strengths:**   1. **High Performance:** The reported 93% accuracy showcases the model's capability and robustness, indicating that LLMs can effectively learn from complex datasets in industrial applications. 2. **User-Centric Design:** The design that allows natural language processing is a strong point, as it broadens the model’s applicability to users who may not have deep technical knowledge. 3. **Clear Methodology:** The paper describes the approach to fine-tuning and evaluating the model effectively, facilitating replication and further research. **Weaknesses:**   1. **Dataset Limitations:** The performance claims rely heavily on the quality and comprehensiveness of the dataset. Without broader and more diverse datasets, it is unclear how the model will perform in real-world applications. 2. **Scope of Defect Categories:** Focusing on a limited number of defects may restrict the broad applicability of the model. Future work might expand the range of defects considered. 3. **Comparative Analysis:** The comparison of different formatting methods could be more rigorously demonstrated with additional benchmarks against other machine learning techniques, strengthening the case for LLMs specifically. **Influence on the Field:**   This paper has the potential to influence both the field of additive manufacturing and the machine learning community by providing a novel application of LLMs. If successful in broader implementation, it could lead to more machine learning approaches being applied to engineering challenges, paving the way for intelligent manufacturing systems. **Score: 8**  The score reflects a strong contribution to the field with significant practical implications and innovative use of technology. However, certain limitations in the dataset scope and need for further validation keep it from receiving a higher rating. Overall, the paper represents a meaningful step forward in predictive modeling for manufacturing defects using cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

- **Abstract**: In this work, we introduce Janus-Pro, an advanced version of the previous work Janus. Specifically, Janus-Pro incorporates (1) an optimized training strategy, (2) expanded training data, and (3) scaling to larger model size. With these improvements, Janus-Pro achieves significant advancements in both multimodal understanding and text-to-image instruction-following capabilities, while also enhancing the stability of text-to-image generation. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in the field. Code and models are publicly available.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces Janus-Pro, an enhanced version of the previously developed Janus system focusing on unified multimodal understanding and generation. Key advancements in Janus-Pro include an optimized training methodology, the incorporation of a larger and more diverse dataset, and a scaling of model size. These enhancements significantly improve the system’s capabilities in multimodal understanding (the ability to interpret and process multiple forms of data) and in adhering to text-to-image instructions, while also leading to greater stability in image generation processes. The authors assert that their work sets a foundation for future research and development in multimodal systems. The accompanying code and models are made available to the public. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** *Novelty:* Janus-Pro builds upon its predecessor Janus, which indicates that it is not entirely novel but rather an iterative improvement. While the strategies employed (optimized training, expanded data, and model scaling) are not unique to this paper and have been seen in various forms across the AI field, the authors claim notable advancements in specific tasks related to multimodal systems. The careful synthesis of these elements does suggest a potential for novel insights, but the paper should clearly articulate how these components interact to produce distinct advantages over existing systems. *Significance:* The significance of Janus-Pro lies in its contributions to both the academic community and practical applications in multimodal AI. The enhancements in text-to-image generation and understanding could lead to better tools for creative industries and improve the usability of generative models in various fields. However, the paper's impact is somewhat diminished by the lack of extensive comparative analysis against state-of-the-art systems. Without demonstrating how Janus-Pro outperforms rival models in specific metrics or tasks, it is challenging to gauge the full extent of its significance. *Strengths:* 1. The paper presents a clear progression from Janus to Janus-Pro, along with methodological details that may influence future research. 2. Public accessibility of the code and models promotes transparency and encourages further experimentation by the community. *Weaknesses:* 1. The novelty is moderate, given the reliance on established techniques without substantial new theoretical contributions. 2. The evaluation may lack breadth, particularly in benchmarking against contemporary multimodal models, which could solidify claims regarding improvements. **Overall Assessment:** Considering the iterative nature of the work, its mixture of established methods, and the potential its enhancements bring to multimodal systems while noting the limited scope of novelty, I assign a score of 6. This score reflects the paper's capability to contribute to the ongoing conversation in multimodal AI while acknowledging that more rigorous comparisons and explorations of novel approaches would strengthen its position and influence within the field. **Score: 6**

### Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17840v1)
- **Authors**: Pouya Pezeshkpour, Estevam Hruschka
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various tasks, yet their ability to extract and internalize deeper insights from domain-specific datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how continual pre-training can enhance LLMs' capacity for insight learning across three distinct forms: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic insights. Focusing on two critical domains: medicine and finance, we employ LoRA to train LLMs on two existing datasets. To evaluate each insight type, we create benchmarks to measure how well continual pre-training helps models go beyond surface-level knowledge. We also assess the impact of document modification on capturing insights. The results show that, while continual pre-training on original documents has a marginal effect, modifying documents to retain only essential information significantly enhances the insight-learning capabilities of LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Learning Beyond the Surface: How Far Can Continual Pre-Training with LoRA Enhance LLMs' Domain-Specific Insight Learning?" explores the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in deriving in-depth knowledge from domain-specific datasets by utilizing continual pre-training techniques. The authors concentrate on enhancing three types of insight learning: declarative, statistical, and probabilistic. Using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for training LLMs on medical and financial datasets, they develop benchmarks to evaluate how well these models can transcend superficial understanding. The study finds that while continual pre-training on original documents yields minimal improvements, significant gains in insight learning arise when documents are modified to emphasize essential information. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** The investigation into continual pre-training, especially its combination with LoRA, represents a relevant advance in the field of LLMs. The focus on three distinct forms of insight learning addresses an underexplored area in the literature, where much existing research tends to prioritize model performance on standard evaluations rather than how these models learn to internalize deeper domain knowledge. **Strengths:** 1. **Practical Application:** The choice of domains (medicine and finance) demonstrates practical relevance, as these fields require sophisticated knowledge extraction capabilities. 2. **Methodological Rigor:** The use of benchmarks to measure insight learning enhances the empirical robustness of their findings, providing a clear framework for evaluation. 3. **Insightful Findings:** The paper highlights the significant impact of document modification on insight extraction, adding an important dimension to research on pre-training strategies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Marginal Improvements:** The findings indicate that while modification of documents leads to better outcomes, the overall enhancement from continual pre-training alone appears limited. This raises questions about the scalability of the proposed methods across different contexts or datasets. 2. **Generalizability:** The study seems to be primarily focused on two domains, which could limit the applicability of the findings to other fields. Further research is needed to determine if similar strategies yield benefits in other areas. 3. **Lack of Theoretical Framework:** While practical insights are provided, the paper would benefit from a stronger theoretical underpinning to contextualize the significance of the findings within existing literature. **Overall Influence:** The conclusions drawn in this paper could influence future research directions surrounding LLMs, especially with regard to the methodologies for preparing training data for deeper insight acquisition. By demonstrating the potential of document modification, this work could encourage further exploration of alternative pre-training techniques and their effects on learning capabilities. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's substantial contribution to understanding continual pre-training and insight learning in LLMs but also highlights the technical limitations and the need for broader applicability to enhance its overall impact.

### Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17858v1)
- **Authors**: Rui Min, Tianyu Pang, Chao Du, Qian Liu, Minhao Cheng, Min Lin
- **Abstract**: Chatbot Arena is a popular platform for evaluating LLMs by pairwise battles, where users vote for their preferred response from two randomly sampled anonymous models. While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM ranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve (or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a straightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles involving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and exclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically inefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average only about $1\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we propose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of Chatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the target model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle. We conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the Chatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve model rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes. While we have evaluated several defense mechanisms, our findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to prevent vote rigging. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/Rigging-ChatbotArena.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Improving Your Model Ranking on Chatbot Arena by Vote Rigging" addresses vulnerabilities in the Chatbot Arena, a platform for evaluating large language models (LLMs) through user-generated pairwise voting. The authors demonstrate that crowdsourced voting can be manipulated to artificially boost the ranking of a specific target model ($m_{t}$), proposing two types of rigging strategies. The first, a target-only rigging strategy, focuses on directly influencing battles involving $m_{t}$ but is limited due to low engagement—only about 1% of new battles include $m_{t}$. To enhance efficacy, the authors introduce omnipresent rigging strategies that leverage the platform's Elo rating system, allowing any vote within the ecosystem to impact $m_{t}$'s ranking. Their experiments on approximately 1.7 million historical votes demonstrate that a relatively small number of votes can significantly alter rankings, raising concerns about the integrity of the Chatbot Arena voting process. The paper also discusses defensive mechanisms against vote rigging, underlining the need for ongoing efforts to address these exploitative practices. **Rigorous Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance**:  1. **Novelty**: The primary novelty of this paper lies in its demonstration of vote rigging within a specific evaluation platform for LLMs, a topic that has substantial implications for the integrity of model evaluation in machine learning. The introduction of the omnipresent rigging strategy enhances the original concept by showing how a model's rank can be manipulated indirectly, representing a significant extension beyond the straightforward manipulation indicated in prior methodologies. However, while the concept of rigging itself is not new (fraudulent practices exist in various fields), the application to the field of LLMs within a gamified environment provides a fresh perspective. 2. **Significance**: This work highlights a critical vulnerability in the evaluation mechanisms used in LLM benchmarking, urging developers and researchers to be aware of potential manipulations to ensure trust in comparisons and rankings. Given the growing reliance on such platforms, the implications are not just theoretical but highly practical. **Strengths**: - **Comprehensive Analysis**: The authors provide a detailed exploration of the modeling aspects and practical experimentation, showcasing significant findings relevant to stakeholders in AI. - **Data-Driven**: The use of 1.7 million historical votes adds robustness to their arguments, underpinning their claims with empirical evidence. - **Actionable Insights**: The identification of defensive strategies against vote rigging fosters a proactive approach to maintaining platform integrity. **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Scope**: The focus on one platform's voting mechanism may limit the generalizability of the findings to other evaluation contexts, although the principles of rigging could apply elsewhere. - **Ethical Implications**: The discussion of rigging strategies, while important for raising awareness, needs more emphasis on the ethical ramifications of employing such tactics, especially when considering potential misuse by individuals or organizations. **Conclusion**: Overall, this paper demonstrates significant contributions to the field, particularly in emphasizing the importance of integrity in LLM evaluations. Its implications may drive future research into robust ranking systems, inspiring more secure methodologies for evaluating AI models. **Score: 8**. The paper is impactful and presents novel findings that articulate important vulnerabilities within a sought-after evaluation setting. However, it could enhance its significance with a broader discussion of ethical considerations and implications beyond the specific case studied.
