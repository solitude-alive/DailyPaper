- **Authors**: Allard Oelen, Sören Auer
- **Abstract**: The number of published scholarly articles is growing at a significant rate, making scholarly knowledge organization increasingly important. Various approaches have been proposed to organize scholarly information, including describing scholarly knowledge semantically leveraging knowledge graphs. Transforming unstructured knowledge, presented within articles, to structured and semantically represented knowledge generally requires human intelligence and labor since natural language processing methods alone typically do not render sufficient precision and recall for many applications. With the recent developments of Large Language Models (LLMs), it becomes increasingly possible to provide truly intelligent user interfaces guiding humans in the transformation process. We present an approach to integrate non-intrusive LLMs guidance into existing user interfaces. More specifically, we integrate LLM-supported user interface components into an existing scholarly knowledge infrastructure. Additionally, we provide our experiences with LLM integration, detailing best practices and obstacles. Finally, we evaluate the approach using a small-scale user evaluation with domain experts.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper discusses the increasing importance of organizing scholarly knowledge due to the rapid growth of published articles. It highlights traditional challenges in transforming unstructured knowledge from scholarly articles into structured, semantically rich formats, historically requiring considerable human intervention. The authors propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent user interfaces that assist in this transformation, enhancing existing scholarly knowledge infrastructures. They share insights from their integration of LLMs into these interfaces, including best practices and encountered obstacles, and conclude with a small-scale evaluation involving domain experts to assess the effectiveness of their approach. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its application of LLMs to enhance user interfaces for scholarly knowledge organization, which is a relatively innovative approach in the context of information retrieval and data curation. By addressing the gulf between unstructured text and structured knowledge representation, the paper presents a timely contribution to the fields of natural language processing and scholarly communication. However, the paper does have some limitations. While it proposes a practical integration strategy and reports on experiences, the details of these integrations and the evaluation methodologies lack depth. The user evaluation appears small-scale and may not be sufficient to substantiate broader claims about the effectiveness and generalizability of the LLM-supported components. Additionally, the obstacles encountered during LLM integration are minimally addressed, leaving the reader wanting more insight into the practical challenges. The significance of the research is notable as it connects advanced artificial intelligence techniques with tangible applications in scholarly communication, an area ripe for innovation. However, the abstract and results would benefit from clearer exposition on how their findings can influence future work in the field and whether such integrations could reshape scholarly practices on a larger scale. In summary, while the paper provides a fresh perspective on utilizing LLMs for creating intelligent user interfaces, it does not fully capitalize on its potential impact due to limitations in evaluation scope and depth. **Score: 6**

- **Authors**: Daniel Garibi, Shahar Yadin, Roni Paiss, Omer Tov, Shiran Zada, Ariel Ephrat, Tomer Michaeli, Inbar Mosseri, Tali Dekel
- **Abstract**: We present TokenVerse -- a method for multi-concept personalization, leveraging a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Our framework can disentangle complex visual elements and attributes from as little as a single image, while enabling seamless plug-and-play generation of combinations of concepts extracted from multiple images. As opposed to existing works, TokenVerse can handle multiple images with multiple concepts each, and supports a wide-range of concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, pose, and lighting. Our work exploits a DiT-based text-to-image model, in which the input text affects the generation through both attention and modulation (shift and scale). We observe that the modulation space is semantic and enables localized control over complex concepts. Building on this insight, we devise an optimization-based framework that takes as input an image and a text description, and finds for each word a distinct direction in the modulation space. These directions can then be used to generate new images that combine the learned concepts in a desired configuration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenVerse in challenging personalization settings, and showcase its advantages over existing methods. project's webpage in https://token-verse.github.io/
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces TokenVerse, a novel framework for multi-concept personalization using a pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model. TokenVerse can successfully disentangle intricate visual elements from a single image, allowing users to generate new images that combine concepts derived from multiple images. The key innovation is the utilization of a DiT-based T2I model where text input influences the image generation process through attention and modulation techniques. The authors note that their modulation space is semantic, providing localized control over various complex concepts, including objects, accessories, materials, poses, and lighting. The framework functions by optimizing the relationship between image input and text descriptions to map specific words to distinct directions in this modulation space, effectively allowing for the generation of personalized images. The effectiveness of TokenVerse is demonstrated in challenging personalization scenarios, outperforming existing methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of TokenVerse lies in its approach to handling multiple images that can embody multiple concepts, which is a notable advancement over previous methods. This ability to combine and modulate concepts semantically and effectively through a pre-trained model suggests significant potential for fine-tuned personalization in image generation. Additionally, the identification of distinct directions for different concepts in the modulation space is a progressive step that may inspire future research in T2I tasks and personalized content creation. However, while the technical advances are impressive, the paper may not sufficiently explore the limitations of the method or its applicability in real-world scenarios. For example, while the framework claims to provide localized control, it remains to be seen how it performs in a broader range of contexts or with more complex scenes that may not fit neatly into the defined modulation categories. Furthermore, the practical usability of the method needs clarification, including the computational efficiency and the resources required for leveraging such a framework in everyday applications. In terms of impact, the paper seems to be positioned well within the evolving field of AI-driven image generation, particularly with increasing demand for personalized content across various platforms. However, it would benefit from a deeper discussion of future work or potential challenges that may arise in extending the framework. In summary, the strengths of TokenVerse include its innovative approach to multi-concept personalization and the practical utility demonstrated through its application. However, the paper somewhat under-reports the challenges and future directions necessary for broader implementation. Based on these considerations, I would assign the paper a score of 8. **Score: 8**

### CDW-CoT: Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12226v1)
- **Authors**: Yuanheng Fang, Guoqing Chao, Wenqiang Lei, Shaobo Li, Dianhui Chu
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved impressive results in complex reasoning tasks through Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. However, most existing CoT methods rely on using the same prompts, whether manually designed or automatically generated, to handle the entire dataset. This one-size-fits-all approach may fail to meet the specific needs arising from the diversities within a single dataset. To solve this problem, we propose the Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain of Thought (CDW-CoT) method, which dynamically constructs prompts tailored to the characteristics of each data instance by integrating clustering and prompt optimization techniques. Our method employs clustering algorithms to categorize the dataset into distinct groups, from which a candidate pool of prompts is selected to reflect the inherent diversity within the dataset. For each cluster, CDW-CoT trains the optimal prompt probability distribution tailored to their specific characteristics. Finally, it dynamically constructs a unique prompt probability distribution for each test instance, based on its proximity to cluster centers, from which prompts are selected for reasoning. CDW-CoT consistently outperforms traditional CoT methods across six datasets, including commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. Specifically, when compared to manual CoT, CDW-CoT achieves an average accuracy improvement of 25.34% on LLaMA2 (13B) and 15.72% on LLaMA3 (8B).
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper presents Clustered Distance-Weighted Chain-of-Thoughts Reasoning (CDW-CoT), a novel method aimed at enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Traditional Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting methods tend to employ a uniform set of prompts for an entire dataset, which may not effectively address the diverse needs presented by different instances within the dataset. CDW-CoT overcomes this limitation by clustering the dataset to identify distinct groups and tailoring prompt construction to reflect characteristics specific to each group. The method trains a prompt probability distribution for each cluster and dynamically selects prompts for individual test instances based on their proximity to cluster centers. The evaluation shows that CDW-CoT significantly outperforms standard CoT techniques, with notable accuracy improvements on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in commonsense, symbolic, and mathematical reasoning tasks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**:  CDW-CoT introduces a new paradigm in approaching CoT prompting by integrating clustering and prompt optimization, which is a distinct advancement from traditional uniform prompt strategies. By recognizing the diversity within datasets and tailoring prompts accordingly, the authors exhibit a nuanced understanding that has the potential to drive improvements in the application of LLMs. **Strengths**: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The combination of clustering and distance-weighted selection of prompts represents a creative solution to address the limitations of generic CoT methods. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The thorough experimentation across six diverse datasets bolsters the claims made, providing robust evidence of effectiveness. 3. **Significant Results**: The reported accuracy improvements over both standard CoT and manual prompting illustrate the potential for practical application and real-world relevance. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Clustering Limitations**: The effectiveness of clustering methods can vary significantly based on the underlying algorithm and parameters chosen, which may limit the approach if certain datasets are difficult to cluster effectively. 2. **Generalizability**: While promising results are shown, the paper does not discuss the applicability of CDW-CoT across different domains extensively, which raises questions about its generalizability. 3. **Complexity**: The added complexity of implementing clustering and customizing prompts may pose challenges in terms of scalability and ease of use, especially for practitioners without extensive ML backgrounds. **Impact**: The contribution of CDW-CoT is relevant and significant, as it could set a precedent for developing more context-sensitive reasoning frameworks in LLMs. This can lead to improved performance in applications requiring nuanced understanding, although its adaptation by the broader community will depend on overcoming the cited weaknesses. **Score**: 8 This score reflects the paper's considerable novelty and potential impact on the field of LLMs and reasoning tasks while acknowledging its limitations regarding clustering and generalizability, which leave room for further research and refinement.

- **Authors**: Pha Nguyen, Sailik Sengupta, Girik Malik, Arshit Gupta, Bonan Min
- **Abstract**: The improved competence of generative models can help building multi-modal virtual assistants that leverage modalities beyond language. By observing humans performing multi-step tasks, one can build assistants that have situational awareness of actions and tasks being performed, enabling them to cater assistance based on this understanding. In this paper, we develop a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant with Multi-modal Large Language Models (InsTALL) that leverages an online visual stream (e.g. a user's screen share or video recording) and responds in real-time to user queries related to the task at hand. To enable useful assistance, InsTALL 1) trains a multi-modal model on task videos and paired textual data, and 2) automatically extracts task graph from video data and leverages it at training and inference time. We show InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance across proposed sub-tasks considered for multimodal activity understanding -- task recognition (TR), action recognition (AR), next action prediction (AP), and plan prediction (PP) -- and outperforms existing baselines on two novel sub-tasks related to automatic error identification.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents InsTALL, a Context-aware Instructional Task Assistant that utilizes multi-modal large language models to enhance task assistance by incorporating visual data and understanding context. InsTALL is trained using both task videos and corresponding textual data, which enables it to recognize and predict actions within tasks effectively. The model notably extracts task graphs from video data, integrating this information throughout training and inference processes. Results indicate that InsTALL achieves state-of-the-art performance on various sub-tasks such as task and action recognition, next action prediction, and plan prediction. Furthermore, InsTALL demonstrates superior capabilities in automated error identification tasks compared to existing methods. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the intersection of multimodal learning and task assistance technologies. By integrating visual modalities with language input to create context-aware assistants, it addresses a current gap in the literature where many existing systems primarily focus on text or audio inputs without fully utilizing visual context. The notion of constructing task graphs from video data is particularly innovative, as it suggests a structured approach to understanding complex tasks - an area that has seen limited exploration in prior research.  **Strengths:** - **Innovative Approach:** The use of multi-modal inputs for context-aware assistance signifies a novel approach that could enhance user interaction and support in various applications, particularly those involving complex, multi-step processes. - **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper rigorously evaluates InsTALL across several sub-tasks, demonstrating its capability to outperform existing models.

### FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12243v1)
- **Authors**: Yizhou Liu, Ziming Liu, Jeff Gore
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance, and improving their pre-training process appears to be key to enhancing their capabilities further. Based on the documented success of Adam, learning rate decay, and weight decay, we hypothesize that the pre-training loss landscape features a narrowing valley structure. Through experiments with synthetic loss functions, we discover that when gradient query noise is high relative to the valley's sharpness, Adam's performance falls behind that of Signum because Adam reduces the effective step size too drastically. This observation led us to develop FOCUS, an optimizer that enhances Signum by incorporating attraction toward moving averaged parameters, allowing it to handle noise better while maintaining larger step sizes. In training GPT-2, FOCUS proves to be more stable than Signum and faster than Adam. These results suggest that gradient noise may be an underappreciated limiting factor in LLM training, and FOCUS offers promising solutions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "FOCUS: First Order Concentrated Updating Scheme" explores methods to enhance the pre-training of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the limitations found in existing optimizers such as Adam when faced with gradient noise. The authors hypothesize that the loss landscape during pre-training behaves like a narrowing valley, where noise levels can significantly impact optimization performance. Experiments with synthetic loss functions reveal that under conditions of high gradient query noise, Adam's reduction of effective step size contributes to suboptimal performance compared to the Signum optimizer. To address this issue, the authors introduce FOCUS, an optimizer that combines features from Signum with an attraction mechanism towards moving average parameters, promoting larger step sizes while maintaining stability in the presence of noise. Their empirical results, particularly in training GPT-2, show that FOCUS outperforms Signum in stability and is faster than Adam. The findings encourage further investigation into the role of gradient noise in LLM training. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Novelty:** 1. **Innovative Approach to Noise Handling:** The introduction of FOCUS represents a significant innovation by combining the strengths of existing optimization techniques (Signum and Adam) while also addressing a notable gap regarding gradient noise. 2. **Experimental Insights:** The use of synthetic loss functions to investigate optimizer performance under varying conditions of noise adds a unique dimension to the understanding of how different optimizers behave, which is not commonly addressed in the literature. **Significance:** 1. **Potential Impact on LLM Training:** By postulating that gradient noise is an underappreciated factor in the performance of optimizers, the paper opens avenues for future research that could lead to more efficient training approaches for LLMs. 2. **Practical Applications:** The demonstration of FOCUS’s effectiveness, particularly with a widely-used model like GPT-2, indicates practical implications for trainers and researchers in improving performance and stability in various machine learning applications. **Strengths:** - The alignment of theoretical insights with empirical results enhances the validity of the proposed method. - Clear motivation and justification for exploring new optimization strategies in LLM training, rooted in established concepts. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper discusses the implications of gradient noise, it could provide a more detailed analysis of varying noise levels in real-world scenarios, beyond the synthetic benchmarks. - Additional comparisons with other emerging optimizers and more extensive experiments on different models would strengthen the claims made about performance improvements. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field, particularly for those involved in the optimization challenges of LLMs. Its combination of theoretical exploration, empirical validation, and focus on a relevant problem makes it a meaningful addition to current research. **Score: 8**  ### Justification for the Score: The score of 8 reflects a robust contribution but acknowledges areas that could benefit from further elaboration and evidence. The novelty is significant in terms of exploring an often-overlooked aspect (gradient noise), and the results demonstrate clear performance benefits of the proposed optimizer, FOCUS. However, the paper could be strengthened by more comprehensive analysis and wider exploratory comparisons, which somewhat limit its overall impact. Therefore, while it provides a noteworthy step forward, there remains room for additional development and verification within the broader optimization landscape for LLMs.

### VipDiff: Towards Coherent and Diverse Video Inpainting via Training-free Denoising Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12267v1)
- **Authors**: Chaohao Xie, Kai Han, Kwan-Yee K. Wong
- **Abstract**: Recent video inpainting methods have achieved encouraging improvements by leveraging optical flow to guide pixel propagation from reference frames either in the image space or feature space. However, they would produce severe artifacts in the mask center when the masked area is too large and no pixel correspondences can be found for the center. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating diverse and high-quality images, and have been exploited in a number of works for image inpainting. These methods, however, cannot be applied directly to videos to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, named VipDiff, for conditioning diffusion model on the reverse diffusion process to produce temporal-coherent inpainting results without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the pre-trained diffusion models. VipDiff takes optical flow as guidance to extract valid pixels from reference frames to serve as constraints in optimizing the randomly sampled Gaussian noise, and uses the generated results for further pixel propagation and conditional generation. VipDiff also allows for generating diverse video inpainting results over different sampled noise. Experiments demonstrate that VipDiff can largely outperform state-of-the-art video inpainting methods in terms of both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces VipDiff, a novel framework for video inpainting that employs training-free denoising diffusion models. Addressing the limitations of traditional video inpainting techniques that rely on optical flow for pixel propagation, VipDiff effectively handles large masked areas, which often suffer from artifacts due to the absence of pixel correspondences in their centers. This framework uniquely conditions diffusions on the reverse process, utilizing optical flow to extract valid pixels from reference frames. As a result, it optimizes randomly sampled Gaussian noise into temporally coherent inpainted outputs, allowing for diverse results by sampling different noise patterns. Experimental results indicate that VipDiff surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in both spatial-temporal coherence and fidelity in video inpainting. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  VipDiff presents an innovative approach by integrating diffusion models into video inpainting without requiring extensive training or fine-tuning, which is a notable departure from existing methods that necessitate predefined training data. The idea of conditioning the diffusion process utilizing optical flow for coherent results is also a fresh perspective, highlighting the interoperability of diffusion models with temporal constraints in video data. **Significance:**  The significance of VipDiff lies in its potential to alleviate common pitfalls in video inpainting—namely, the generation of artifacts in regions where large areas need reconstruction. This addresses crucial practical challenges faced in video editing and restoration fields, potentially leading to applications in film post-production, archival video restoration, and real-time streaming enhancements. **Strengths:**  - The approach is innovative and leverages cutting-edge techniques in the realm of generative models without the burdensome requirements of training. - The focus on temporal coherence addresses a substantial gap in existing methods. - The experimental results provided are quantitative, showcasing significant improvements over current technologies. **Weaknesses:** - While the framework is compelling, the lack of a comprehensive training component may limit its application versatility compared to methods that can be fine-tuned for specific visual characteristics in different types of videos. - The paper could benefit from more qualitative assessments or comparisons, such as user studies, to confirm perceptions of fidelity beyond numerical results. - Depending on the experimental setup and random noise sampling, there may be limitations on the diversity of results, which warrants further exploration in various contexts. Based on these considerations, VipDiff is assessed as a notable contribution to the field of video inpainting, particularly in terms of addressing existing weaknesses in coherence and fidelity. However, the reliance on a purely training-free methodology may present long-term performance concerns in specialized applications. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Maosong Cao, Taolin Zhang, Mo Li, Chuyu Zhang, Yunxin Liu, Haodong Duan, Songyang Zhang, Kai Chen
- **Abstract**: The quality of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) data plays a critical role in enhancing the conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, as LLMs become more advanced, the availability of high-quality human-annotated SFT data has become a significant bottleneck, necessitating a greater reliance on synthetic training data. In this work, we introduce Condor, a novel two-stage synthetic data generation framework that incorporates World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement to produce high-quality SFT data at scale. Our experimental results demonstrate that a base model fine-tuned on only 20K Condor-generated samples achieves superior performance compared to counterparts. The additional refinement stage in Condor further enables iterative self-improvement for LLMs at various scales (up to 72B), validating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, our investigation into the scaling for synthetic data in post-training reveals substantial unexplored potential for performance improvements, opening promising avenues for future research.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Condor: Enhance LLM Alignment with Knowledge-Driven Data Synthesis and Refinement" addresses the challenge of inadequately available high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for Large Language Models (LLMs) as they become increasingly sophisticated. The authors propose a two-stage synthetic data generation framework called Condor, which leverages a World Knowledge Tree and a Self-Reflection Refinement mechanism to create scalable, high-quality SFT data. Experimental results indicate that a base model fine-tuned on just 20,000 Condor-generated samples outperforms those trained on larger sets of traditional data. Furthermore, the paper highlights the iterative self-improvement potential of LLMs using the additional refinement stage, demonstrating effectiveness across different model sizes—up to 72 billion parameters. The authors also explore the significant but underutilized potential for performance enhancements through synthetic data post-training, suggesting interesting paths for future research. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its structured approach to synthetic data generation, specifically through its two intertwined components—World Knowledge Tree and Self-Reflection Refinement. By explicitly addressing the current bottleneck of human-annotated data, the framework has the potential to significantly mitigate this issue in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs. The claim that models fine-tuned on Condor data can outperform those with traditional data configurations at small scales presents not only a practical advancement but also an intriguing method to maximize the use of synthetic data. However, while the methods proposed appear innovative, the paper could benefit from a more rigorous comparison with existing synthetic data generation techniques, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or traditional augmentation methods. Without sufficient benchmarks against these methods, it may be challenging to ascertain the absolute efficacy of Condor over prior approaches. Moreover, the scope of the experiments could be expanded to include a more varied set of tasks to fully validate the generalizability of their findings. Another point to consider is the potential risk of reliance on synthetic data, particularly regarding biases and misalignments that can arise from inadequate modeling of complex human language and knowledge structures. Such issues, while recognized in the paper, warrant a more detailed discussion on the implications of using synthetics extensively. In conclusion, Condor presents a significant contribution to the field by introducing a scalable method for generating high-quality synthetic data, with possibilities for iterative self-improvement in LLMs. Its promise is tempered, however, by the need for deeper analysis against existing frameworks and potential challenges in applicability. Given these strengths and weaknesses, I assign a score of 7. Score: 7

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12281v1)
- **Authors**: Qishen Zhou, Yifan Zhang, Michail A. Makridis, Anastasios Kouvelas, Yibing Wang, Simon Hu
- **Abstract**: Given a partially observed road network, how can we predict the traffic state of unobserved locations? While deep learning approaches show exceptional performance in traffic prediction, most assume sensors at all locations of interest, which is impractical due to financial constraints. Furthermore, these methods typically require costly retraining when sensor configurations change. We propose MoGERNN, an inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model, to address these challenges. Inspired by the Mixture of Experts approach in Large Language Models, we introduce a Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block to model complex spatial dependencies through multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network. This block estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are then processed by a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates a graph message aggregator to capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict future states. Experiments on two real-world datasets show MoGERNN consistently outperforms baseline methods for both observed and unobserved locations. MoGERNN can accurately predict congestion evolution even in areas without sensors, offering valuable information for traffic management. Moreover, MoGERNN is adaptable to dynamic sensing networks, maintaining competitive performance even compared to its retrained counterpart. Tests with different numbers of available sensors confirm its consistent superiority, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of its key modules.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces MoGERNN, a novel inductive spatio-temporal graph representation model designed for predicting traffic states in partially observed road networks—a scenario where sensor coverage is limited due to financial constraints. Traditional traffic prediction models often require extensive retraining when sensor setups change and typically assume complete sensor data, which is unrealistic in practice. MoGERNN tackles these challenges by incorporating the Mixture of Graph Expert (MoGE) block, which uses multiple graph message aggregators and a sparse gating network to effectively model complex spatial relationships. This approach estimates initial states for unobserved locations, which are further refined through a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder that integrates spatial and temporal dependencies for predicting future traffic states. The effectiveness of MoGERNN was validated through experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms baseline methods in traffic prediction, including in areas without sensors, thereby enhancing its utility for traffic management. The model also adapts well to changing sensor networks, maintaining performance comparable to retrained alternatives. Ablation studies affirm the contributions of its critical components to overall predictive performance. **Critical Evaluation and Score:** **Novelty and Contribution:** MoGERNN presents a meaningful advancement in the field of traffic prediction, particularly for scenarios involving limited sensor availability. By integrating principles from Large Language Models through the Mixture of Experts paradigm into traffic modeling, it establishes a new approach that tackles the inherent challenges of sparsity in sensor data. This innovation potentially shifts the way researchers and practitioners approach traffic state predictions, emphasizing adaptability and efficiency. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Architecture:** The introduction of the MoGE block offers a fresh perspective on incorporating multiple data aggregators, which may significantly enhance predictive accuracy across diverse scenarios. 2. **Real-World Relevancy:** The focus on unobserved locations reflects a real-world challenge, making the model applicable and valuable for urban traffic management. 3. **Robust Testing:** The use of real-world datasets and comprehensive testing (including ablation studies) provides confidence in the model's performance and reliability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalization Limitations:** While the paper demonstrates effectiveness on two datasets, it remains uncertain how well the model generalizes across various urban environments and sensor configurations that were not explored. 2. **Model Complexity:** The incorporation of multiple components increases the model’s complexity, which may lead to challenges in deployment and real-time application. 3. **Assessment of Scalability:** The paper does not extensively address how the model scales with significantly larger networks or with more dynamic changes in sensor setups. **Overall Assessment:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of traffic prediction by addressing practical limitations associated with sensor availability and model retraining. However, the model's generalizability and complexity could be further explored in future work. Nonetheless, the advancements made by MoGERNN represent a noteworthy step in improving traffic management systems through innovative modeling techniques. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: While learning personalization offers great potential for learners, modern practices in higher education require a deeper consideration of domain models and learning contexts, to develop effective personalization algorithms. This paper introduces an innovative approach to higher education curriculum modelling that utilizes large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion, with the goal of creating personalized learning-path recommendations. Our research focuses on modelling university subjects and linking their topics to corresponding domain models, enabling the integration of learning modules from different faculties and institutions in the student's learning path. Central to our approach is a collaborative process, where LLMs assist human experts in extracting high-quality, fine-grained topics from lecture materials. We develop a domain, curriculum, and user models for university modules and stakeholders. We implement this model to create the KG from two study modules: Embedded Systems and Development of Embedded Systems Using FPGA. The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to curriculum modeling in personalized higher education by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph (KG) completion. The authors argue that effective learning personalization requires a thorough understanding of domain models and learning contexts. By linking university subjects and their topics to domain models, they aim to create a cohesive learning path that integrates modules across different faculties. The methodology involves a collaborative process where LLMs aid experts in extracting detailed educational content from lecture materials. The authors develop comprehensive models that encompass domain, curriculum, and user aspects, specifically implementing their approach in two modules related to Embedded Systems. The study evaluates the constructed KG through expert validation and graph quality metrics, demonstrating that their method significantly enhances interdisciplinary course connections for personalized learning experiences. Feedback from domain experts indicates a strong acceptance of the proposed approach for concept extraction and classification. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper asserts a unique application of LLMs in enhancing knowledge graph completion for higher education curriculum modeling, which is a relatively underexplored area. Traditionally, curriculum design has relied heavily on expert knowledge without leveraging computational methods to connect disparate topics across domains. By integrating LLMs in this process, the approach demonstrates an innovative blend of technology and pedagogy that is timely and relevant in today's educational landscape. **Significance:** The significance of this work lies in its potential to reshape the personalization of learning paths in higher education. The creation of a comprehensive KG linking various disciplines can facilitate tailored educational experiences, possibly improving student engagement and retention. Additionally, the collaborative nature of the model development highlights the potential for stakeholder involvement, which is critical for the acceptance and effectiveness of educational technologies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration**: The combination of LLMs with expert human curation presents a fresh perspective on curriculum design. 2. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: The ability to connect courses across faculties promotes an integrated educational approach, which is increasingly relevant. 3. **Validation Framework**: The dual evaluation method (qualitative expert feedback and quantitative metrics) adds robustness to the findings. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scalability Concerns**: While the model was developed for two specific modules, the scalability of this approach to larger academic programs or institutions is not discussed thoroughly. 2. **Dependence on Expert Input**: The reliance on human experts for concept extraction may introduce bias or limit the model's efficacy if expert perspectives are narrow or inconsistent. 3. **Limited Generalizability**: The findings, if only applied within the contexts of the two chosen modules, may not necessarily be applicable across all fields of higher education. In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the intersection of technology and education, with a focus on enhancing learning personalization.

- **Authors**: Thomas Walshe, Sae Young Moon, Chunyang Xiao, Yawwani Gunawardana, Fran Silavong
- **Abstract**: Acquiring labelled training data remains a costly task in real world machine learning projects to meet quantity and quality requirements. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, have shown great promises in labelling data with high accuracy. However, privacy and cost concerns prevent the ubiquitous use of GPT-4. In this work, we explore effectively leveraging open-source models for automatic labelling. We identify integrating label schema as a promising technology but found that naively using the label description for classification leads to poor performance on high cardinality tasks. To address this, we propose Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC) for which LLM performs inferences for one label at a time using corresponding label schema; we start with the most related label and iterates until a label is chosen by the LLM. We show that our method, which dynamically integrates label description, leads to performance improvements in labelling tasks. We further show that by focusing only on the most promising labels, RAC can trade off between label quality and coverage - a property we leverage to automatically label our internal datasets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Automatic Labelling with Open-source LLMs using Dynamic Label Schema Integration" addresses the challenge of acquiring high-quality labeled training data in machine learning, which is often expensive and time-consuming. The authors investigate the potential of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatic data labeling, given the limitations and concerns associated with proprietary models like GPT-4. They introduce a novel approach called Retrieval Augmented Classification (RAC), which focuses on using label schema dynamically during the labeling process. This technique allows the LLM to consider one label at a time, starting from the most relevant, thus improving performance in high-cardinality labeling tasks. The results indicate that RAC enhances labeling accuracy while balancing label quality and coverage, providing a viable solution for automating the labeling of internal datasets. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several significant strengths. Firstly, the choice to explore open-source LLMs addresses crucial concerns regarding privacy and cost, which are barriers to the widespread application of advanced machine learning techniques in industry. The introduction of the RAC method represents a thoughtful innovation; by dynamically integrating label descriptions, the paper shifts away from traditional, less efficient methods of label classification that can struggle with high cardinality. However, the paper has some limitations. While the approach demonstrates improvements, the experimental details, such as the datasets used and metrics for evaluation, are not discussed in depth, which may impede reproducibility and limit the understanding of the method's applicability across different scenarios. Additionally, although the paper claims performance improvements, it would benefit from a stronger comparative analysis with existing methods to quantify the advantages more convincingly. The novelty of the study lies not only in the application of RAC but also in its broader implications for how LLMs can manage label integration in machine learning tasks. The concept of dynamically iterating through labels to enhance classification mirrors emerging trends towards more interactive and user-influenced AI systems. Overall, the paper has a meaningful impact on the field of automated machine learning and the use of LLMs for data labeling. Given the significant concerns it addresses, alongside its innovative approach, I would rate the paper as follows: **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's solid contributions to open-source LLM application and labeling methodologies while noting certain areas for improvement in clarity and comparative analysis. The work provides valuable insights and lays a foundation for further exploration in enhancing the efficacy of label integration in machine learning.

### Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352v1)
- **Authors**: Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi, Emily B. Fox
- **Abstract**: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a unifying framework for understanding various architectures used in sequence modeling through the lens of associative memory and regression at test-time. The authors argue that effective sequence models must have the capability for associative recall, which they show is linked to the ability to memorize input tokens. They analyze numerous contemporary architectures, such as linear attention models and state-space models, framing them as different strategies for performing test-time regression. The paper outlines three design choices that dictate an architecture's performance: the weight of associations, the nature of the regressor function, and the optimization method used. This approach not only provides insights into model design but also offers theoretical validation for existing methods, paving the way for advanced developments in sequence modeling. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper's central thesis provides a significant contribution to the field by proposing a coherent framework that connects a variety of seemingly disparate sequence modeling techniques. The emphasis on associative memory as a key component in sequence modeling is innovative and highlights an often-overlooked aspect of model performance—recall of learned inputs. One of the strengths of the paper is its ability to derive insights from existing models and establish connections that may inspire further research. The treatment of models like linear attention and softmax attention is particularly notable, as it contextualizes these methods within a broader theoretical framework. Additionally, the authors' introduction of regression as a critical function at test-time could stimulate new research directions aimed at more effective design principles. However, while the framework is unifying, it risks oversimplifying the complexities inherent in the design and behavior of advanced sequence models. Moreover, the empirical validation of the framework and its propositions could be stronger; the paper largely relies on theoretical underpinnings without detailed experiments to substantiate the claims regarding model performance or efficiency. The theoretical connections drawn in the paper, such as the justification for QKNorm, are valuable but could be built upon with more rigorous analytical or empirical studies. As a result, while the framework is promising, the actual application of it in new model development and real-world scenarios remains to be fully tested. In summary, while the paper articulates a compelling vision for understanding and integrating sequence models, the potential impact may be somewhat tempered by the need for more empirical grounding.  **Score: 8**

### Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372v1)
- **Authors**: Yeounoh Chung, Gaurav T. Kakkar, Yu Gan, Brenton Milne, Fatma Ozcan
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information. In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve a strong performance with 67.41\% on BIRD benchmark (dev) without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL" investigates how the extended context capabilities of large language models (LLMs), specifically Google's gemini-1.5-pro, can enhance the natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) transformation task. NL2SQL is inherently complex due to the ambiguity of natural language questions and the precise requirements for SQL syntax in relation to complex data schemas. The authors explore various forms of contextual information—including column example values, question and SQL pairs, user hints, and SQL documentation—to assess their impact on the model's performance and latency. This research is unique in its comprehensive analysis of how extended context and additional contextual elements contribute to accuracy and efficiency in NL2SQL tasks. The results indicate that the long-context capabilities of LLMs are effective, as demonstrated by a benchmark score of 67.41% on the BIRD dataset without needing finetuning or complex techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a novel exploration of the relationship between extended context usage in LLMs and the efficiency of NL2SQL generation. This is highly relevant due to the increasing importance of automated querying systems, especially with the growth of data-centric applications.  Strengths: 1. **Timeliness and Relevance**: The exploration of long context in LLMs aligns with current trends in NLP and data querying, offering insights that reflect the advancements in model architecture and capabilities. 2. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The paper provides a thorough examination of various types of contextual prompts, which could benefit further research and practical implementations in NL2SQL tasks. 3. **Strong Performance Results**: Achieving a 67.41% accuracy on the BIRD benchmark with minimal additional techniques is impressive and suggests significant potential for real-world applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Benchmark Comparisons**: While the BIRD benchmark is relevant, further comparisons with other NL2SQL benchmarks or datasets could strengthen the validity of the results and generalizability to different contexts. 2. **Lack of Finetuning Analysis**: The paper mentions the lack of finetuning and more sophisticated methods, which raises questions about the model's scalability and adaptability in different scenarios with more complex datasets. 3. **Potential Overlook of Complexity**: The simplifying assumption that longer context alone yields better results may overlook other crucial factors impacting model performance, such as the nature of the queries or inherent biases in data schema representations. Overall, while the paper provides valuable insights and has potential implications for the field, its empirical analysis feels somewhat limited in scope when considering the diverse nature of real-world NL2SQL applications. Given these points, I would rate the paper as a **7** out of 10.  **Score: 7**

### Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1)
- **Authors**: Hongjun Wang, Wonmin Byeon, Jiarui Xu, Jinwei Gu, Ka Chun Cheung, Xiaolong Wang, Kai Han, Jan Kautz, Sifei Liu
- **Abstract**: We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a new attention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2D spatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linear attention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as 1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomes these limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data and forming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central to GSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-aware propagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and no reliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity and state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNet classification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation. Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ when generating 16K images.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), an innovative attention mechanism designed to address limitations faced by existing models in efficiently processing multi-dimensional, spatially coherent image data. Unlike conventional methods that transform multi-dimensional data into 1D sequences, GSPN retains 2D spatial structures and deploys a line-scan approach to establish dense pairwise connections. This mechanism implements the Stability-Context Condition to maintain stable, context-aware data propagation, effectively reducing the sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for square maps, thereby improving computational efficiency. The GSPN operates with learnable, input-dependent weights and eliminates the need for positional embeddings, resulting in enhanced spatial fidelity. Its performance outstrips current standards in several vision tasks, exemplified by accelerated generation in SD-XL models by more than 84 times for 16K image outputs. **Critical Evaluation:** The introduction of GSPN marks a notable advancement in the field of attention mechanisms, particularly for vision tasks where spatial coherence is crucial. The emphasis on maintaining 2D spatial structures while reducing computational demands presents a compelling challenge to traditional transformer models that typically flatten data for processing. The Stability-Context Condition represents a novel conceptual framework that aims to optimize propagation across 2D sequences, which could inspire further research into context-aware models for various applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** GSPN introduces a fundamentally new way to approach attention mechanisms that can directly benefit tasks uniquely tied to spatial representational fidelity. 2. **Computational Efficiency:** The significant reduction in effective sequence length and improved speed for high-resolution image generation highlights GSPN's practical advantages, potentially enabling faster workflows in real-world applications. 3. **Performance Metrics:** Achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse vision tasks lends credibility to the methodologies adopted and underscores the competitive edge of GSPN over prior models. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Scalability:** While GSPN shows promise, how it scales with even larger datasets or more intricate tasks remains an open question. The multi-fold increase in computational performance should be weighed against potential complexities arising from its dense connection strategy. 2. **Dependence on Specific Context:** The reliance on the Stability-Context Condition may pose challenges in varied applications with highly dynamic spatial relationships; additional empirical evidence across a broader spectrum of tasks would strengthen its validity. 3. **Comparison with Existing Models:** While claimed improvements in specific tasks are impressive, a more exhaustive comparison against contemporary models in diverse settings and datasets would provide a better insight into its overall effectiveness. This paper represents a substantial contribution to the field of deep learning and computer vision. Its novel approach could inspire future research, although the practical implications of broader applications still need to be evaluated.

### DiffDoctor: Diagnosing Image Diffusion Models Before Treating
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12382v1)
- **Authors**: Yiyang Wang, Xi Chen, Xiaogang Xu, Sihui Ji, Yu Liu, Yujun Shen, Hengshuang Zhao
- **Abstract**: In spite of the recent progress, image diffusion models still produce artifacts. A common solution is to refine an established model with a quality assessment system, which generally rates an image in its entirety. In this work, we believe problem-solving starts with identification, yielding the request that the model should be aware of not just the presence of defects in an image, but their specific locations. Motivated by this, we propose DiffDoctor, a two-stage pipeline to assist image diffusion models in generating fewer artifacts. Concretely, the first stage targets developing a robust artifact detector, for which we collect a dataset of over 1M flawed synthesized images and set up an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation process, incorporating a carefully designed class-balance strategy. The learned artifact detector is then involved in the second stage to tune the diffusion model through assigning a per-pixel confidence map for each synthesis. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness of our artifact detector as well as the soundness of our diagnose-then-treat design.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces **DiffDoctor**, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to enhance image diffusion models by reducing the production of artifacts. The first stage involves creating a robust artifact detection system, supported by a dataset of over 1 million flawed synthesized images and an efficient human-in-the-loop annotation strategy that ensures a balanced representation of defects. The second stage integrates the developed artifact detector to generate per-pixel confidence maps for the image generation process, allowing for more focused refinement of the diffusion model. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments that their approach effectively reduces artifacts in text-to-image diffusion models, supporting the proposed diagnose-then-treat paradigm. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  The novelty of DiffDoctor lies in its dual approach—first diagnosing the specific locations of artifacts and then treating them rather than relying solely on holistic quality assessments. This targeted methodology is a marked advancement over existing strategies that do not account for spatial variations in defects. Additionally, the creation of a large dataset specifically for artifact detection contributes to the field by providing necessary resources for development and evaluation. **Significance:** In the context of the rapidly evolving field of image synthesis, as seen with the growing interest in diffusion models, producing cleaner images is paramount. The proposed methodology addresses a significant issue—artifacts—that hinder the full potential of these technologies in practical applications. By introducing a systematic process for detecting and correcting defects, DiffDoctor could enhance the reliability of image generation tools, which may lead to wider adoption in various fields such as gaming, film, and virtual reality. **Strengths:** - The large-scale dataset and human-in-the-loop annotation process are well-conceived and likely to yield high-quality training for the artifact detection model. - The rigorous experimental setup provides compelling evidence for the proposed method's effectiveness, enhancing confidence in the results. **Weaknesses:** - The study focuses exclusively on text-to-image diffusion models, which may limit the general applicability of the findings to other diffusion tasks or models. - The potential computational overhead introduced by the two-stage process may raise concerns about efficiency and feasibility in real-time applications. **Potential Influence:** Given the growing importance of mitigating artifacts in image synthesis, DiffDoctor could set a precedent for future research focused on defect identification and correction in generative models. It highlights the importance of not only generating high-quality images but also understanding and managing the failures of these models. **Score: 8** This score reflects a balanced view of the paper's contributions and limitations. While indeed innovative and addressing a relevant problem within the field of image diffusion models, there remains a gap in applicability across various contexts and model types that future research will need to address. The strong methodological approach and the potential impact on the domain bolster its overall significance, yet further generalization and efficiency improvements would enhance its utility.

### Audio Texture Manipulation by Exemplar-Based Analogy
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12385v1)
- **Authors**: Kan Jen Cheng, Tingle Li, Gopala Anumanchipalli
- **Abstract**: Audio texture manipulation involves modifying the perceptual characteristics of a sound to achieve specific transformations, such as adding, removing, or replacing auditory elements. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based analogy model for audio texture manipulation. Instead of conditioning on text-based instructions, our method uses paired speech examples, where one clip represents the original sound and another illustrates the desired transformation. The model learns to apply the same transformation to new input, allowing for the manipulation of sound textures. We construct a quadruplet dataset representing various editing tasks, and train a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised manner. We show through quantitative evaluations and perceptual studies that our model outperforms text-conditioned baselines and generalizes to real-world, out-of-distribution, and non-speech scenarios. Project page: https://berkeley-speech-group.github.io/audio-texture-analogy/
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel method for audio texture manipulation using an exemplar-based analogy model. Rather than relying on text-based commands, the technique utilizes pairs of audio clips: one representing the original sound and another exemplifying the desired transformation. The model is designed to learn this transformation and apply it to new inputs, successfully enabling various modifications to audio textures. A curated quadruplet dataset was created for different editing tasks, and the authors trained a latent diffusion model in a self-supervised way. Evaluation results, both quantitative and perceptual, demonstrate that this approach exceeds the performance of traditional text-conditioned models and can adapt to real-world and non-speech scenarios. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its shift from conventional text-based audio manipulation to a more intuitive and example-driven approach. This is significant because audio manipulation often struggles with subjective interpretations of text-based instructions, leading to less effective or less controllable outputs. By using audio pairs, the model allows for clearer transformation guidance, potentially making it more user-friendly and applicable in practical scenarios, such as sound design and music production. One strength of the paper is its emphasis on a self-supervised learning paradigm, which enhances the model's ability to generalize across diverse audio domains. This is particularly relevant given the abundance of unlabeled audio data available. Additionally, the construction of a quadruplet dataset for training highlights the authors' approach to addressing the complexity of audio transformations, which may not map neatly to textual representations. However, there are also several weaknesses and areas for improvement. The scope of the evaluation could benefit from a larger variety of conditions and scenarios beyond speech, particularly concerning different genres of music or environmental sounds. Moreover, while the paper claims to outperform existing models, the specific metrics used for comparison and the extent of this performance gap should be detailed with clearer visualizations to substantiate the claims made, thus reinforcing the arguments presented. Furthermore, the direct applicability and computational efficiency of the model in real-time scenarios remain to be assessed, an essential factor for broader adoption in production environments. Overall, the paper contributes valuable insight into a potentially transformative method for audio manipulation, balancing novelty with practical applications. However, due to the current limitations in evaluation scope and depth, as well as a lack of extensive comparative analysis, I assign the following score: Score: 7

Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM. Code and models are available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo/tree/main/InternVideo2.5
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "InternVideo2.5: Empowering Video MLLMs with Long and Rich Context Modeling" presents an advancement in video multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with the introduction of long and rich context (LRC) modeling. The authors develop a new iteration of InternVideo, which enhances the model's ability to interpret fine-grained details and understand long-term temporal structures in videos. This is achieved by integrating dense task-specific annotations through direct preference optimization, and creating compact spatiotemporal representations via adaptive hierarchical token compression. The experimental results indicate that this approach significantly improves the model's performance across various video understanding benchmarks, extending its capacity to process inputs at least six times longer than previous versions, while also enhancing capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. The study emphasizes the critical role of multimodal context richness in enhancing the effectiveness of MLLMs, providing valuable insights for subsequent research. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents several strengths: 1. **Technical Innovation**: The integration of long and rich context modeling addresses a notable limitation in existing video MLLMs, where processing long video sequences and appreciating fine details often pose significant challenges. The novel use of dense annotations and adaptive token compression represents a useful contribution to the field. 2. **Empirical Validation**: The demonstration of improved performance benchmarks lends credibility to the proposed methods. The results showing a sixfold increase in input memory are particularly significant, indicating a substantial advancement in the model’s capabilities. 3. **Potential for Further Research**: By emphasizing multimodal context richness, the paper opens pathways for future explorations in video understanding and MLLM architectures. However, there are some weaknesses to consider: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the results are compelling, a more rigorous comparative analysis with other leading MLLM frameworks could strengthen the paper by positioning the contributions more clearly against existing state-of-the-art models. 2. **Generalizability**: The focus on specific benchmarks may limit the perceived robustness of the findings. It would benefit the authors to validate their model across a broader set of datasets and tasks to ensure versatility in diverse real-world applications. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The methods proposed, given their innovative nature, may introduce computational complexity that could hinder practical application. A discussion on computational trade-offs and efficiency could further substantiate the impact of their work. Overall, while the paper contributes important insights and methodologies to the field of video MLLMs, the relative novelty and significance could be assessed further through comparative frameworks and broader validation.  **Score: 8**

### GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12390v1)
- **Authors**: Chao Feng, Ziyang Chen, Aleksander Holynski, Alexei A. Efros, Andrew Owens
- **Abstract**: We show that the GPS tags contained in photo metadata provide a useful control signal for image generation. We train GPS-to-image models and use them for tasks that require a fine-grained understanding of how images vary within a city. In particular, we train a diffusion model to generate images conditioned on both GPS and text. The learned model generates images that capture the distinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. We also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillation sampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of the reconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that our GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation" explores the utility of GPS data embedded in photo metadata as a control signal for generating images. The authors train models that convert GPS coordinates into images, particularly focusing on a diffusion model that generates images conditioned on both GPS locations and text. This allows for the generation of images that authentically reflect the unique characteristics of different city neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. Furthermore, the study details a method for extracting three-dimensional models from the two-dimensional GPS-to-image outputs by employing score distillation sampling, accentuating how GPS conditioning facilitates the quality of reconstructed images from various viewpoints. Evaluations demonstrate that the models infused with GPS data are adept at producing location-specific images and enhancing the accuracy of estimated 3D structures. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:** The paper presents a compelling novel approach by integrating GPS data with image generation processes through a diffusion model. While the application of GPS in image modeling has been touched upon in previous studies, the authors add value by demonstrating how GPS can serve as a control signal for generating highly localized images and reconstructing 3D structures. The combination of text and GPS data to condition image generation creates a new avenue for high-fidelity synthetic media that reflects real-world variations, which is a significant contribution. **Significance:** The significance lies in the practical implications of the research, especially in fields such as urban planning, tourism, and virtual simulations, where realistic representations of varying locales are essential. The ability to generate images that accurately convey the essence of different geographic areas opens new possibilities for user-guided imagery and interactive applications. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The use of diffusion models for conditioning on GPS and text is an innovative approach that can inspire future research. 2. **Multidimensional Output:** The ability to extract 3D models from the generated images is a noteworthy advancement that goes beyond image generation to spatial representation. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The evaluation results suggest that the models effectively learn location-based characteristics, providing solid empirical support for the claims made. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Contextual Application:** While the results are promising, the application seems primarily urban-centric, which could limit broader generalizability to diverse environments (e.g., rural areas) where GPS data may not carry the same significance. 2. **Complexity of Model Training:** The addition of GPS and text as conditioning elements may complicate the model training process, requiring substantial computational resources and potentially influencing accessibility for broader research engagement. 3. **Lack of Wider Comparisons:** The paper could improve its impact by comparing its outcomes directly to other state-of-the-art techniques in the image generation field, thereby contextualizing its contributions more sharply. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper makes a notable contribution by addressing an innovative intersection of geographical information systems and image generation technologies. It enhances depth in understanding spatial variations through data-driven methodologies, suggesting potential future avenues for applied research. However, the limitations in broader applicability and direct comparative evaluations weaken the impact somewhat. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovative aspect and practical significance, while also acknowledging the limitations in scope and comparative analysis, which are essential for positioning advancements within an evolving research landscape.

### Towards Affordance-Aware Articulation Synthesis for Rigged Objects
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12393v1)
- **Authors**: Yu-Chu Yu, Chieh Hubert Lin, Hsin-Ying Lee, Chaoyang Wang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Ming-Hsuan Yang
- **Abstract**: Rigged objects are commonly used in artist pipelines, as they can flexibly adapt to different scenes and postures. However, articulating the rigs into realistic affordance-aware postures (e.g., following the context, respecting the physics and the personalities of the object) remains time-consuming and heavily relies on human labor from experienced artists. In this paper, we tackle the novel problem and design A3Syn. With a given context, such as the environment mesh and a text prompt of the desired posture, A3Syn synthesizes articulation parameters for arbitrary and open-domain rigged objects obtained from the Internet. The task is incredibly challenging due to the lack of training data, and we do not make any topological assumptions about the open-domain rigs. We propose using 2D inpainting diffusion model and several control techniques to synthesize in-context affordance information. Then, we develop an efficient bone correspondence alignment using a combination of differentiable rendering and semantic correspondence. A3Syn has stable convergence, completes in minutes, and synthesizes plausible affordance on different combinations of in-the-wild object rigs and scenes.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Towards Affordance-Aware Articulation Synthesis for Rigged Objects" addresses the challenge of articulating rigged objects in a way that is both realistic and context-sensitive. These objects, prevalent in the artistic and animation pipelines, can be difficult to pose naturally without extensive input from skilled artists. The authors introduce a novel system called A3Syn, which automates the synthesis of articulation parameters for various rigged objects based on specific contexts defined by environment meshes and text prompts. A3Syn employs a 2D inpainting diffusion model and advanced control techniques to generate affordance-aware postures. It also innovates a robust bone correspondence alignment approach using differentiable rendering and semantic matching. The process is designed to operate efficiently, delivering results in minutes without the need for extensive training data or rigid topological constraints on the rigs used. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance The paper makes several notable contributions to the field of computer graphics and animation. The approach of synthesizing articulation based on environmental context and affordance awareness is quite innovative, addressing a significant limitation in current rigged object manipulation systems. The use of a 2D inpainting diffusion model for generating complex poses is a fresh perspective that suggests potential for broader applications beyond the specific case of rigged objects. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty of Approach**: The integration of inpainting diffusion models and the lack of strict topological assumptions represent a significant advancement. This opens doors for more flexible and varied applications in animations and simulations. 2. **Efficiency**: The ability of A3Syn to produce results within minutes while maintaining stability and plausibility in output is a strong advantage, particularly in high-demand creative environments. 3. **Broad Applicability**: The system’s compatibility with a wide range of rigged objects found online enhances its practical relevance and usability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Training Data Limitations**: The claim of operating with limited training data, while ambitious and beneficial, may lead to challenges in the robustness of the models, especially in edge cases where unique rig variations are presented. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could fall short regarding the quantitative evaluation of the synthesized articulations; stronger metrics could reinforce claims about convergence and plausibility. 3. **Lack of Comparative Analysis**: There is minimal discussion on how A3Syn compares to existing methods in terms of both qualitative output and computational efficiency, which could leave some questions around its relative performance. **Potential Influence**: This work has the potential to significantly impact fields such as game design, animation, and virtual reality, where the need for dynamic and realistic representations of objects is increasing. If the methodologies presented in A3Syn are adopted and further developed, they could change the landscape of rigged object utilization in these areas. ### Conclusion Overall, while the paper presents a compelling foundation and a clear advancement in affordance-aware articulation for rigged objects, it has room for improvement in terms of validation and comparative analysis. Its innovative aspect, particularly with the synthesis methods and operational efficiency, however, positions it as a noteworthy contribution to the field of computer graphics. **Score: 8**
