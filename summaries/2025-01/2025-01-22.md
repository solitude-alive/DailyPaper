- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10200v1)
- **Authors**: Azat Abdullin, Pouria Derakhshanfar, Annibale Panichella
- **Abstract**: Generating tests automatically is a key and ongoing area of focus in software engineering research. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.
- **Summary**: ### Detailed Summary The paper titled "Test Wars: A Comparative Study of SBST, Symbolic Execution, and LLM-Based Approaches to Unit Test Generation" addresses the evolving landscape of automated unit test generation, particularly through the lens of three distinct methodologies: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) represented by EvoSuite, Symbolic Execution represented by Kex, and a novel approach utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) represented by TestSpark. The authors begin by positioning automated test generation as a crucial task in software engineering, seeking efficacy and efficiency in identifying bugs and ensuring software reliability. The surge in interest around LLMs has prompted exploration into their application for this purpose; however, a comparative evaluation against established techniques remains sparse. This study bridges this gap by performing an extensive evaluation using the GitBug Java dataset, which contains a variety of Java projects. #### Methodology 1. **Tools Used**:     - **EvoSuite**: A tool implementing SBST, focusing on generating test cases based on search strategies.    - **Kex**: A symbolic execution tool that aims to generate precise test cases by exploring all feasible paths through program code.    - **TestSpark**: An LLM-based approach leveraging the semantic capabilities of modern machine learning models to generate unit tests. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The comparison is made using execution-based metrics (e.g., coverage, fault detection) and feature-based metrics (complexity, CUT dependencies). #### Results - **Coverage**: LLM-based generation yielded lower code coverage compared to SBST and symbolic execution. This suggests that while LLMs can write tests, they may not explore the codebase as thoroughly as their traditional counterparts.    - **Mutation Scores**: The LLM-based approach exhibited higher mutation scores, indicating that these tests better detect subtle semantic issues—a potential strength due to the models' understanding of programming semantics. - **Fault Detection**: LLMs were found to underperform relative to SBST and symbolic execution methods when it came to identifying faults, indicating a potential weakness in the ability to generate extensive test cases that adequately cover error scenarios. - **Feature Sensitivity**: The performance of all tools was impacted by the complexity of the class under test, with LLM-based approaches particularly sensitive to the size and complexity of the CUT.  ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation #### Strengths 1. **Timeliness**: The exploration of LLMs in the context of a rapidly advancing area of AI and software engineering is relevant and timely. 2. **Comparative Approach**: The paper's comparative study involving prominent testing methodologies provides valuable insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of these systems. 3. **Comprehensive Dataset**: The use of the GitBug Java dataset allows for a robust empirical evaluation, which enhances the reliability of the findings. #### Weaknesses 1. **Limited Scope**: The evaluation focuses primarily on three tools and may not capture the full range of capabilities or performance of all LLM-based test generation tools. More tools could be included to give a broader perspective. 2. **Narrow Metrics**: While the selected metrics offer insights, additional metrics—such as maintainability of generated tests or execution time—might present a more holistic view of the performance. 3. **Specificity of Results**: The findings indicate that LLMs underperform in certain metrics; however, no clear pathway is provided for improving their effectiveness, which could limit the paper's actionability for practitioners wishing to integrate such tools into their workflows. #### Overall Impact While the paper provides novel insights into the capabilities of LLMs compared to traditional methods of automatic test generation, it does not sufficiently challenge or redefine methodologies but rather serves more as a point of comparison. Its contributions to the field are significant but not groundbreaking enough to catalyze major shifts in practices or paradigms. ### Score: 6 This score reflects a good contribution to the field with valuable insights into the comparison of legacy techniques with emerging LLM-based approaches, while also highlighting areas for future exploration. However, the study's limited scope and the lack of actionable outcomes to enhance LLM efficacy substantially reduce its novelty and potential impact on practices and theories within software engineering.

- **Authors**: Wenqi Fan, Yi Zhou, Shijie Wang, Yuyao Yan, Hui Liu, Qian Zhao, Le Song, Qing Li
- **Abstract**: Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing & generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.
- **Summary**: ### Detailed Summary The paper "Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)" explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, specifically large language models, and computational protein science. The authors acknowledge the foundational importance of proteins in biological systems and highlight how computational approaches have traditionally aimed to elucidate the relationships among protein sequences, structures, and functions. While previous AI models showed promise in niche applications, they often struggled with understanding the semantic complexities of protein sequences and exhibited limited generalizability across diverse protein-related tasks. The emergence of large language models represents a paradigm shift, offering enhanced language processing and generalization capabilities. This innovation enables a more comprehensive advancement across multiple areas within computational biology instead of being confined to discrete tasks. Consequently, researchers have started to develop protein Language Models (pLMs) that leverage these capabilities, allowing for a deeper understanding of proteins and enabling a versatile approach to solving a wide array of sequence-structure-function challenges. ### Key Contributions of the Paper: 1. **Categorization of Existing pLMs:** The authors provide a systematic classification of various protein language models based on their competencies, including understanding sequence patterns, structural and functional insights, and the ability to work with external scientific languages. 2. **Utilization and Adaptation of pLMs:** The paper highlights practical applications of pLMs, showcasing their effectiveness in protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and studies in protein design. 3. **Application Domains:** The authors detail the contributions of pLMs in specific areas such as antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery, underscoring their impact in translating protein science findings into practical applications. 4. **Future Directions:** The authors conclude with a discussion on potential future trajectories of this research field, suggesting a roadmap for further advancements enabled by LLM techniques. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Strengths:**    - The paper makes a compelling argument for the integration of LLMs in computational protein science. The systematic overview and categorization of pLMs present a valuable resource for researchers entering this area.    - It intelligently links the evolution of AI in protein science with recent advancements in LLMs, marking a significant turning point where broader capabilities can be applied to complex biological questions.    - The detailed examples of practical applications illustrate the transformative potential of pLMs, providing a concrete basis for future research directions. 2. **Weaknesses:**    - While the paper summarizes existing pLMs effectively, it does not delve deeply into the limitations and challenges these models face. Issues such as data bias, overfitting, and the need for large, high-quality datasets are overlooked, which are critical considerations in any model building.    - The discussion on future directions is more aspirational than concrete, lacking specific methodologies or experimental frameworks that could be pursued to harness the potential of LLMs in computational protein science.    - The paper could also benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the interplay between biological realism and computational models, exploring how these models can be validated in real-world biological scenarios. ### Score Justification Given the strengths and weaknesses outlined, the paper is deemed to contribute significantly to the field of computational protein science through its timely exploration of LLM applications. However, due to its surface-level treatment of certain critical aspects, a balanced score is warranted. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution with promising implications for future research while also highlighting areas that require further exploration and critical analysis. The paper serves as a useful entry point into the rapidly evolving intersection of protein science and AI but would benefit from deeper considerations of the limitations and complexities involved in such advancements.

## Addressing Popularity Bias in Third-Party Library Recommendations Using LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10313v1)
- **Authors**: Claudio Di Sipio, Juri Di Rocco, Davide Di Ruscio, Vladyslav Bulhakov
- **Abstract**: Recommender systems for software engineering (RSSE) play a crucial role in automating development tasks by providing relevant suggestions according to the developer's context. However, they suffer from the so-called popularity bias, i.e., the phenomenon of recommending popular items that might be irrelevant to the current task. In particular, the long-tail effect can hamper the system's performance in terms of accuracy, thus leading to false positives in the provided recommendations. Foundation models are the most advanced generative AI-based models that achieve relevant results in several SE tasks. This paper aims to investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to address the popularity bias in recommender systems of third-party libraries (TPLs). We conduct an ablation study experimenting with state-of-the-art techniques to mitigate the popularity bias, including fine-tuning and popularity penalty mechanisms. Our findings reveal that the considered LLMs cannot address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, even though fine-tuning and post-processing penalty mechanism contributes to increasing the overall diversity of the provided recommendations. In addition, we discuss the limitations of LLMs in this context and suggest potential improvements to address the popularity bias in TPL recommenders, thus paving the way for additional experiments in this direction.
- **Summary**: ### Detailed Summary The paper titled "Addressing Popularity Bias in Third-Party Library Recommendations Using LLMs" explores a significant challenge in software engineering recommender systems: popularity bias. This bias often skews recommendations towards popular items, overshadowing potentially more relevant but less popular options. This long-tail effect can adversely affect the accuracy of the recommendations provided to developers, leading to false positives that may not align with the current development task. The authors target the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as a possible remedy to this issue, given LLMs' recent advancements and their successful application across various software engineering tasks. They conduct an ablation study that involves several state-of-the-art techniques aimed at mitigating popularity bias. These techniques include fine-tuning the LLMs on relevant data and employing a popularity penalty mechanism designed to prioritize less popular, yet potentially more pertinent, libraries. The results of their study indicate that while employing fine-tuning and popularity penalty mechanisms can enhance the diversity of recommendations, these methodologies do not effectively address the root of popularity bias in recommenders for third-party libraries (TPLs). The authors acknowledge the limitations of current LLMs in overcoming this issue and propose that further research could explore other methodologies or enhancements that might deepen their effectiveness in this domain. The paper ends with discussions on future directions and improvements that could lead to more effective solutions for handling popularity bias, thereby fostering further experimental investigations. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The novelty of this paper is rooted in its exploration of an essential issue—popularity bias—within TPL recommender systems using LLMs as a proposed solution. Despite the growing interest in LLMs, this specific application to address popularity bias provides a unique angle. However, it does not introduce a groundbreaking methodology or a new theoretical framework. The results reaffirm existing knowledge that popularity bias is a significant challenge in recommendation systems. **Significance**:  From a practical viewpoint, the insights generated by the study bear significance for practitioners in software development, particularly in the intricacies of developing effective recommender systems. Nevertheless, the findings that LLMs currently do not resolve the popularity bias in TPL recommenders concurrently highlight limitations, which may deter some readers expecting affirmative solutions. **Strengths**: 1. **Structured Methodology**: The ablation study provides a rigorous approach to understanding the impact of various techniques on the performance of LLMs in mitigating popularity bias. 2. **Relevance**: The topic is pertinent given the increased reliance on third-party libraries in software development, making the implications of addresses popularity bias critical for improving developer productivity. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Scope**: The focus narrowly on LLMs might limit broader insights; alternative models or hybrid approaches could have also been investigated. 2. **Outcome Limitations**: The inability of fine-tuning and penalty mechanisms to fully address the issue leaves the paper lacking a compelling resolution or concrete suggestions for practical implementation. 3. **Future Directions**: While the authors propose potential improvements, these suggestions lack specificity and could benefit from a more detailed exploration. ### Overall Rationale and Score While the paper raises a critical issue within the context of software engineering and provides a structured methodology for investigating it, its failure to deliver conclusive solutions diminishes its impact. The narrow focus on LLMs, combined with the paper's acknowledgment of their limitations without in-depth exploration of alternative methodologies, weakens its overall contributions. Given these considerations, I would assign the paper a **Score: 5**. This reflects a moderate level of novelty and significance; it addresses an important topic but falls short of offering a profound or transformative insight or solution to the problem at hand.

## HiMix: Reducing Computational Complexity in Large Vision-Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10318v1)
- **Authors**: Xuange Zhang, Dengjie Li, Bo Liu, Zenghao Bao, Yao Zhou, Baisong Yang, Zhongying Liu, Yujie Zhong, Zheng Zhao, Tongtong Yuan
- **Abstract**: Benefiting from recent advancements in large language models and modality alignment techniques, existing Large Vision-Language Models(LVLMs) have achieved prominent performance across a wide range of scenarios. However, the excessive computational complexity limits the widespread use of these models in practical applications. We argue that one main bottleneck in computational complexity is caused by the involvement of redundant vision sequences in model computation. This is inspired by a reassessment of the efficiency of vision and language information transmission in the language decoder of LVLMs. Then, we propose a novel hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism called Hierarchical Vision injection for Mixture Attention (HiMix). In HiMix, only the language sequence undergoes full forward propagation, while the vision sequence interacts with the language at specific stages within each language decoder layer. It is striking that our approach significantly reduces computational complexity with minimal performance loss. Specifically, HiMix achieves a 10x reduction in the computational cost of the language decoder across multiple LVLM models while maintaining comparable performance. This highlights the advantages of our method, and we hope our research brings new perspectives to the field of vision-language understanding. Project Page: https://xuange923.github.io/HiMix
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper **Title:** HiMix: Reducing Computational Complexity in Large Vision-Language Models **Abstract Recap:** The paper presents HiMix, a new hierarchical vision-language interaction mechanism aimed at addressing the computational complexity associated with Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The authors identify redundancy in the vision sequences used during model computations as a critical factor contributing to this complexity. They propose that vision sequences interact with language sequences selectively during certain stages of the language decoder, instead of undergoing full forward propagation. This selective focus enables HiMix to achieve a drastic reduction in computational costs—up to 10x in the language decoder—while maintaining performance levels comparable to existing models. The research seeks to influence the field of vision-language understanding by introducing a more efficient framework for model interaction. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:** 1. **Redundancy Identification:** The paper's identification of the redundancy in vision sequences in LVLMs as a source of computational complexity is a significant contribution. This reassessment opens up discussions about efficiency in multi-modal models, which is sorely needed in the current landscape dominated by resource-intensive architectures. 2. **Hierarchical Interaction Mechanism:** HiMix introduces a hierarchical method for vision and language interaction that is innovative. By allowing selective interaction rather than full propagation, the proposed method challenges conventional approaches in model architectures that do not consider hierarchical processing effectively. This mechanism is presented as a novel solution that could pave the way for more efficient designs in the future. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper reportedly provides empirical results showcasing the effectiveness of HiMix across multiple LVLMs while demonstrating the claimed reductions in computational cost. However, the extent of performance loss (described as "minimal") needs rigorous empirical backing across diverse datasets and scenarios.  **Significance and Impact:** 1. **Practical Applications:** A noteworthy aspect of the paper is its focus on reducing computational complexity. In an era where model deployment is increasingly constrained by resource availability, providing a solution that makes LVLMs more practical for real-world applications is a significant step forward. 2. **Potential for Future Research:** By offering a new perspective on vision-language interaction, the work has potential implications for future research in both enhancing these models and exploring new architectures that capitalize on the insights presented. **Strengths:** - Clear identification of a common issue in the field and proposal of a thoughtful solution. - Significant empirical results indicating a substantial reduction in computational costs. - Accessible writing style that makes complex ideas understandable. **Weaknesses:** - Limited exploration of the types of tasks or datasets where performance might differ more significantly, raising questions about generalizability. - Absence of in-depth comparative analyses with leading edge architectures that have already optimized other facets (such as sparsity or dynamic computation), which might affect the perceived impact. - The term “minimal performance loss” could benefit from quantification or statistical analysis to provide clearer assurance of model robustness across a variety of tasks. ### Score: 7 **Rationale:** The score of 7 reflects the paper’s solid contributions to the field, particularly in addressing a pressing issue of computational complexity that limits practical application of LVLMs. While it offers novel mechanisms with promising empirical results, the lack of deeper analysis into performance degradation across different contexts prevents it from reaching the highest tiers. The work is commendable and moves the discourse forward, yet it must be accompanied by broader validation to firmly establish its significance and impact on future research trajectories in vision-language models.

## Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformers: Combining Byte-~and Word-Level Processing for Robust, Adaptable Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10322v1)
- **Authors**: Pit Neitemeier, Björn Deiseroth, Constantin Eichenberg, Lukas Balles
- **Abstract**: Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking text into units that computational models can process. While learned subword tokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and sensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations, we investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language modelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a lightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word embeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded back into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains the sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on a rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion parameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task performance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly greater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued pretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as fast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of its previously learned knowledge. Hierarchical transformers pave the way for NLP systems that are more robust, flexible, and generalizable across languages and domains.
- **Summary**: ### Detailed Summary The paper titled "Hierarchical Autoregressive Transformers: Combining Byte- and Word-Level Processing for Robust, Adaptable Language Models" addresses fundamental challenges in natural language processing (NLP) associated with tokenization. Tokenization is vital as it involves segmenting text into manageable units that language models can efficiently process. The authors highlight issues with current subword tokenizers, which, despite being widely adopted, face problems linked to large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new languages or domains, and vulnerabilities to spelling errors. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language modeling that integrates both character-level and word-level processing. The structure consists of three main components: 1. **Character-Level Encoder**: This component is lightweight and converts input character sequences into word embeddings, creating a bridge between raw text and the more abstract word-level representations. 2. **Word-Level Backbone Model**: This model processes the embeddings generated from the character-level encoder. It lays the groundwork for capturing more extensive contextual relations, thereby leveraging the strengths of traditional word-level approaches. 3. **Character-Level Decoder**: After processing the word embeddings, the model decodes the information back into characters, thus maintaining flexibility in generating outputs without being countered by a strict vocabulary. The authors conducted extensive experiments with this hierarchical transformer architecture at parameter scales up to 7 billion. Their findings reveal that the proposed models not only achieve performance on par with traditional subword-tokenizer-based models across various downstream tasks but also demonstrate significantly enhanced robustness to input perturbations, such as spelling mistakes. Moreover, when researchers applied continued pretraining on out-of-domain languages, the hierarchical transformers showcased a much faster training process and superior performance on thereafter trained languages while retaining previously learned knowledge. ### Critical Evaluation #### Strengths 1. **Novel Framework**: The paper introduces a novel approach by combining character-level and word-level processing to form a hierarchical model, addressing several key limitations of existing tokenization methods. This level of innovation is necessary for advancing the field. 2. **Performance Metrics**: It presents concrete empirical evidence at a significant scale (up to 7 billion parameters) that exhibits strong performance and robustness, which is critical for real-world applications in NLP. 3. **Adaptability**: The ability of the model to adapt quickly and effectively to new languages or domains is particularly relevant in today's multilingual and dynamic data landscape. 4. **Robustness**: By showing robustness to minor input errors, this paper responds to a key need in NLP systems, providing a pathway to more resilient applications. #### Weaknesses 1. **Complexity of Implementation**: While the hierarchical architecture is promising, the practical implementation of such models may involve higher operational complexities and computational resources, which could turn into barriers for wider adoption. 2. **Lack of Benchmark Comparisons**: Although the paper claims competitive performance, a more comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art models would strengthen its claims. It is unclear how this proposed method stands against other cutting-edge techniques, particularly in edge cases. 3. **Generalization Claims**: There is a heavy emphasis on adaptability; however, the paper could benefit from a deeper discussion on how this architecture might deal with languages with vastly different syntax or structure that deviate from the training targets. 4. **Theoretical Justification**: While the practical outcomes are promising, there is less exploration of the theoretical underpinnings supporting why hierarchical models outperform their flat counterparts at a more granular level. ### Score Considering the paper's substantial contributions alongside its noted weaknesses, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects the paper's innovative approach to addressing existing challenges in tokenization and language robustness, although it still leaves room for improvement in clarity of its comparative performance, practical implications, and theoretical foundation. Overall, it has the potential to influence future developments in NLP but may not be transformative without further validation and refinement.  **Score: 7**

## DiffStereo: High-Frequency Aware Diffusion Model for Stereo Image Restoration
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10325v1)
- **Authors**: Huiyun Cao, Yuan Shi, Bin Xia, Xiaoyu Jin, Wenming Yang
- **Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved promising performance in image restoration but haven't been explored for stereo images. The application of DM in stereo image restoration is confronted with a series of challenges. The need to reconstruct two images exacerbates DM's computational cost. Additionally, existing latent DMs usually focus on semantic information and remove high-frequency details as redundancy during latent compression, which is precisely what matters for image restoration. To address the above problems, we propose a high-frequency aware diffusion model, DiffStereo for stereo image restoration as the first attempt at DM in this domain. Specifically, DiffStereo first learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) of HQ images. DM is then trained in the learned space to estimate LHFR for stereo images, which are fused into a transformer-based stereo image restoration network providing beneficial high-frequency information of corresponding HQ images. The resolution of LHFR is kept the same as input images, which preserves the inherent texture from distortion. And the compression in channels alleviates the computational burden of DM. Furthermore, we devise a position encoding scheme when integrating the LHFR into the restoration network, enabling distinctive guidance in different depths of the restoration network. Comprehensive experiments verify that by combining generative DM and transformer, DiffStereo achieves both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality on stereo super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement compared with state-of-the-art methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper: "DiffStereo: High-Frequency Aware Diffusion Model for Stereo Image Restoration"** The paper presents DiffStereo, a novel diffusion model (DM) designed specifically for restoring stereo images—a task that has not been explored thoroughly in the context of diffusion models. The authors identify several challenges associated with applying DMs for stereo image restoration, particularly the high computational costs that arise from reconstructing two images. Additionally, they critique existing latent DMs that tend to focus on semantic detail while discarding high-frequency information, which is integral to effective image restoration. To overcome these challenges, DiffStereo operates in a two-phase approach. First, it learns latent high-frequency representations (LHFR) from high-quality (HQ) images. This is an important step as it ensures that the high-frequency details that are often lost during the standard latent compression are captured effectively. Subsequently, the DM is trained in this learned latent space to estimate the LHFR for stereo images. Key features of DiffStereo include: 1. **Preservation of Texture**: By keeping the resolution of LHFR the same as the input images, DiffStereo ensures the retention of inherent textures that might otherwise be obscured in the restoration process. 2. **Computational Efficiency**: The model alleviates the computational burden often associated with DMs through channel compression, which allows for a more efficient processing of stereo images. 3. **Position Encoding**: The authors introduce a unique position encoding scheme to enhance the integration of LHFR into the restoration network. This encoding offers distinctive guidance at varying depths of the network, thereby improving the restoration quality at different levels of abstraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffStereo outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various stereo image restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, providing both higher reconstruction accuracy and better perceptual quality. **Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance** The paper's contributions lie primarily in its application of diffusion models to stereo image restoration, an area that is underexplored, making it novel in that regard. The approach of preserving high-frequency details through LHFR is innovative and demonstrates potential applicability to other areas of image processing where texture preservation is critical. The incorporation of a transformer-based network further enriches the model's architecture, merging the generative capabilities of diffusion models with the localization strengths usually associated with transformers. However, several critical aspects warrant attention: 1. **Limited Scope of Experiments**: While the paper asserts improvements over existing methods, the comparison metrics and benchmarks should be rigorously examined. It would strengthen the claims of superiority if additional datasets and noise conditions were explored. 2. **Theoretical Underpinnings**: The theoretical justification of why LHFR significantly enhances performance remains somewhat vague. More rigorous detail on the underpinnings of why high-frequency representations are critical in this context could further support the claims. 3. **Generalizability**: The model’s performance in stereo image restoration is established, but broader assessments on other forms of multi-image restoration (such as multi-view imaging) would help evaluate the model's versatility. Overall, while the paper offers a compelling advancement in stereo image restoration through innovative use of a diffusion model, some points of theoretical support and experimental coverage could be improved for a more robust contribution to the field. **Score: 7** This score reflects a strong foundation in novel application but acknowledges the need for more comprehensive validation and theoretical detail. The potential influence on the field is noteworthy, especially as stereo imaging becomes increasingly relevant in applications such as virtual reality and depth sensing. However, given the existing gaps in experimental depth and theoretical clarity, a score of 7 fairly represents its impact relative to higher-tier contributions.

- **Authors**: Zhenzhen Zhuang, Jiandong Chen, Hongfeng Xu, Yuwen Jiang, Jialiang Lin
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted human society, influencing various domains. Among them, academia is not simply a domain affected by LLMs, but it is also the pivotal force in the development of LLMs. In academic publications, this phenomenon is represented during the incorporation of LLMs into the peer review mechanism for reviewing manuscripts. We proposed the concept of automated scholarly paper review (ASPR) in our previous paper. As the incorporation grows, it now enters the coexistence phase of ASPR and peer review, which is described in that paper. LLMs hold transformative potential for the full-scale implementation of ASPR, but they also pose new issues and challenges that need to be addressed. In this survey paper, we aim to provide a holistic view of ASPR in the era of LLMs. We begin with a survey to find out which LLMs are used to conduct ASPR. Then, we review what ASPR-related technological bottlenecks have been solved with the incorporation of LLM technology. After that, we move on to explore new methods, new datasets, new source code, and new online systems that come with LLMs for ASPR. Furthermore, we summarize the performance and issues of LLMs in ASPR, and investigate the attitudes and reactions of publishers and academia to ASPR. Lastly, we discuss the challenges associated with the development of LLMs for ASPR. We hope this survey can serve as an inspirational reference for the researchers and promote the progress of ASPR for its actual implementation.

- **Authors**: Zizhou Zhang, Xinshi Li, Yu Cheng, Zhenrui Chen, Qianying Liu
- **Abstract**: Credit risk management within supply chains has emerged as a critical research area due to its significant implications for operational stability and financial sustainability. The intricate interdependencies among supply chain participants mean that credit risks can propagate across networks, with impacts varying by industry. This study explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance credit risk identification in supply chains. GANs enable the generation of synthetic credit risk scenarios, addressing challenges related to data scarcity and imbalanced datasets. By leveraging GAN-generated data, the model improves predictive accuracy while effectively capturing dynamic and temporal dependencies in supply chain data. The research focuses on three representative industries-manufacturing (steel), distribution (pharmaceuticals), and services (e-commerce) to assess industry-specific credit risk contagion. Experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-based model outperforms traditional methods, including logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks, achieving superior accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. The findings underscore the potential of GANs in proactive risk management, offering robust tools for mitigating financial disruptions in supply chains. Future research could expand the model by incorporating external market factors and supplier relationships to further enhance predictive capabilities.

- **Summary**: ### Detailed Summary: The paper titled "Credit Risk Identification in Supply Chains Using Generative Adversarial Networks" addresses a crucial issue in supply chain management: credit risk. The authors highlight that credit risk management has gained importance due to its implications for operational stability and financial sustainability across interconnected supply chain networks. The study focuses on how credit risks can propagate within supply chains, with these effects varying significantly by industry. To tackle the issue of credit risk identification, the authors propose the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs are a type of machine learning model that consists of two neural networks— a generator and a discriminator— that work against each other to produce synthetic data that mimics real-world data. This approach helps overcome common challenges in risk modeling such as data scarcity and imbalanced datasets, which are pertinent in credit risk evaluation. The research evaluates the GAN-based model within three diverse industries— manufacturing (specifically steel), distribution (pharmaceuticals), and services (e-commerce)— providing a comprehensive assessment of how credit risk contagion manifests across different sectors. The findings indicate improvements in predictive accuracy when utilizing GAN-generated synthetic data compared to traditional methodologies like logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The GAN approach notably achieved enhanced performance metrics including accuracy, recall, and F1 scores, suggesting that the model effectively captures the dynamic and temporal nature of supply chain data. The authors conclude by advocating for the potential of GANs as valuable tools for proactive risk management, arguing that their integration can lead to more robust mitigation strategies for financial disruptions in supply chains. They point out possible avenues for further research, such as incorporating external market factors and deeper analysis of supplier relationships to strengthen predictive capabilities. ### Rigorous and Critical Evaluation: #### Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The application of GANs to credit risk identification is a unique contribution, as GANs are typically associated with image generation and other fields, not directly with financial risk assessment in supply chains. 2. **Practical Implications**: By demonstrating the utility of GANs in enhancing predictive accuracy, the study has practical implications for industry stakeholders looking to minimize financial disruptions. 3. **Robust Methodology**: The study’s evaluation across three diverse industries adds credibility to its findings, showcasing the model’s adaptability and potential for broad application. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the results are promising, the study is limited by its focus on only three industries. There may be unique factors influencing credit risk in other sectors that are not captured in this research. 2. **Data Requirements**: The success of GANs heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. The lack of empirical validation on real-world data could reduce the perceived effectiveness of the model. 3. **Complexity**: GANs are notoriously difficult to train and can produce unstable outputs. The study should be cautious in claiming impressive improvements without a thorough discussion of model training, validation, and potential shortcomings. #### Influence on the Field: The integration of advanced machine learning techniques, such as GANs, into credit risk identification in supply chains represents a significant step forward in risk management strategies. The paper encourages further exploration of data-driven techniques in logistical finance, indicating a trend towards more sophisticated modeling practices. ### Score Justification: Given the paper's novel approach, its strong methodological backbone, and its potential implications for both academia and industry, it deserves recognition. However, its limitations regarding generalizability, data dependency, and GAN training challenges suggest that while it is a valuable contribution, it does not fully revolutionize the field.  **Score: 7**  This score reflects its solid contributions while acknowledging the areas that require further validation and exploration before it could be considered transformative in the domain of credit risk management within supply chains.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10360v1)
- **Authors**: Kartik Narayan, Vibashan VS, Vishal M. Patel
- **Abstract**: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities across a wide range of tasks and domains. However, their capacity for face understanding has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we introduce FaceXBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs on complex face understanding tasks. FaceXBench includes 5,000 multimodal multiple-choice questions derived from 25 public datasets and a newly created dataset, FaceXAPI. These questions cover 14 tasks across 6 broad categories, assessing MLLMs' face understanding abilities in bias and fairness, face authentication, recognition, analysis, localization and tool retrieval. Using FaceXBench, we conduct an extensive evaluation of 26 open-source MLLMs alongside 2 proprietary models, revealing the unique challenges in complex face understanding tasks. We analyze the models across three evaluation settings: zero-shot, in-context task description, and chain-of-thought prompting. Our detailed analysis reveals that current MLLMs, including advanced models like GPT-4o, and GeminiPro 1.5, show significant room for improvement. We believe FaceXBench will be a crucial resource for developing MLLMs equipped to perform sophisticated face understanding. Code: https://github.com/Kartik-3004/facexbench
