- **Abstract**: Generative AI has had a profound impact on biomedicine and health, both in professional work and in education. Based on large language models (LLMs), generative AI has been found to perform as well as humans in simulated situations taking medical board exams, answering clinical questions, solving clinical cases, applying clinical reasoning, and summarizing information. Generative AI is also being used widely in education, performing well in academic courses and their assessments. This review summarizes the successes of LLMs and highlights some of their challenges in the context of education, most notably aspects that may undermines the acquisition of knowledge and skills for professional work. It then provides recommendations for best practices overcoming shortcomings for LLM use in education. Although there are challenges for use of generative AI in education, all students and faculty, in biomedicine and health and beyond, must have understanding and be competent in its use.
- **Summary**: **Detailed Summary:** The paper titled "Generative Artificial Intelligence: Implications for Biomedical and Health Professions Education" explores the transformative impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), on biomedical and health education.

- **Abstract**: Generating tests automatically is a key and ongoing area of focus in software engineering research. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities, given their ability to perform a wide spectrum of tasks. However, the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches compared to traditional techniques such as search-based software testing (SBST) and symbolic execution remains uncertain. In this paper, we perform an extensive study of automatic test generation approaches based on three tools: EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based test generation. We evaluate tools performance on the GitBug Java dataset and compare them using various execution-based and feature-based metrics. Our results show that while LLM-based test generation is promising, it falls behind traditional methods in terms of coverage. However, it significantly outperforms them in mutation scores, suggesting that LLMs provide a deeper semantic understanding of code. LLM-based approach also performed worse than SBST and symbolic execution-based approaches w.r.t. fault detection capabilities. Additionally, our feature-based analysis shows that all tools are primarily affected by the complexity and internal dependencies of the class under test (CUT), with LLM-based approaches being especially sensitive to the CUT size.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper **Title**: Test Wars: A Comparative Study of SBST, Symbolic Execution, and LLM-Based Approaches to Unit Test Generation The paper explores the evolving landscape of automated test generation methodologies in software engineering, specifically contrasting three distinct approaches: Search-Based Software Testing (SBST), Symbolic Execution, and Large Language Model (LLM)-based techniques. The research is anchored on a practical evaluation using three tools—EvoSuite for SBST, Kex for symbolic execution, and TestSpark for LLM-based generation—against a standard dataset, the GitBug Java dataset. #### Key Findings: 1. **Testing Coverage**: The results reveal that LLM-based test generation, while innovative, does not match the test coverage provided by traditional methods such as SBST and symbolic execution. 2. **Mutation Scores**: Interestingly, LLM approaches demonstrate superior mutation scores, indicating a potentially richer semantic comprehension of the code compared to their traditional counterparts. 3. **Fault Detection**: LLM-based methods were also less effective in detecting faults compared to SBST and symbolic execution. 4. **Complexity Sensitivity**: A feature-based analysis indicates that all tools are influenced by the complexity and internal dependencies of the Class Under Test (CUT), with LLM approaches showing heightened sensitivity to CUT size, suggesting limitations in scalability. The authors conclude that while LLM-based testing presents a promising avenue due to its semantic capabilities, traditional methods still outperform it in critical metrics like coverage and fault detection. ### Critical Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths**: - **Timely Comparison**: The paper provides a timely and relevant comparison of emerging LLM technologies with established testing methodologies. This is crucial as LLMs are increasingly being integrated into various software engineering tasks. - **Methodological Rigor**: The methodology utilized in the empirical evaluation, grounded in the GitBug dataset, lends credence to the findings and allows for reproducibility. - **Broader Implications**: The discussions surrounding the capabilities and limitations of LLM-based testing contribute valuable insights to the field of automated software testing, paving the way for future research on improving LLM applications in this domain. **Weaknesses**: - **Limited Scope**: The paper primarily focuses on only three tools. While these tools are representative, a broader analysis including more diverse methodologies could have yielded richer insights and context. - **Surface-Level Analysis**: Although the differences in coverage and mutation scores are discussed, the paper could provide a deeper analysis into why LLM-based techniques underperform in fault detection, possibly highlighting inherent limitations in LLM training or data bias. - **Comparative Metrics**: The reliance on execution-based and feature-based metrics alone may not fully encapsulate the effectiveness of testing approaches. Consideration of additional metrics, such as the time efficiency of test generation or ease of use for developers, would provide a more holistic view. Overall, the contributions of the paper are significant in the ongoing dialogue regarding automation in software testing but do not present a paradigm shift due to the limitations highlighted.  **Potential Impact**: The implications of this study could inform both academic research and industry practices, especially as the field continues to grapple with the inclusion of AI in software engineering tasks. **Score**: 7 - **Justification for Score**: The paper's contributions are notable and represent a valuable and current investigation into a highly relevant topic within software engineering. Nonetheless, the limitations in scope, depth of analysis, and the lack of groundbreaking conclusions reduce its novelty and impact relative to other works in the field. A score of 7 reflects a solid contribution that is above average but stops short of being transformative.
