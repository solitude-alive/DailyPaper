- **Abstract**: Cybersecurity education is challenging and it is helpful for educators to understand Large Language Models' (LLMs') capabilities for supporting education. This study evaluates the effectiveness of LLMs in conducting a variety of penetration testing tasks. Fifteen representative tasks were selected to cover a comprehensive range of real-world scenarios. We evaluate the performance of 6 models (GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Llama 3.1 405B, Mixtral 8x7B and WhiteRabbitNeo) upon the Metasploitable v3 Ubuntu image and OWASP WebGOAT. Our findings suggest that GPT-4o mini currently offers the most consistent support making it a valuable tool for educational purposes. However, its use in conjonction with WhiteRabbitNeo should be considered, because of its innovative approach to tool and command recommendations. This study underscores the need for continued research into optimising LLMs for complex, domain-specific tasks in cybersecurity education.

- **Authors**: Wooyoung Kim, Byungyoon Park, Wooju Kim
- **Abstract**: Graph-structured data plays a vital role in numerous domains, such as social networks, citation networks, commonsense reasoning graphs and knowledge graphs. While graph neural networks have been employed for graph processing, recent advancements have explored integrating large language models for graph-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), which addresses the limitations of the scalability issues in node-level projection and information loss in graph-level projection. LGPT enables flexible and efficient graph representation by introducing learnable parameters that act as tokens in large language models, balancing fine-grained and global graph information. Additionally, we investigate an Early Query Fusion technique, which fuses query context before constructing the graph representation, leading to more effective graph embeddings. Our method achieves a 4.13\% performance improvement on the GraphQA benchmark without training the large language model, demonstrating significant gains in handling complex textual-attributed graph data.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Learnable Graph Pooling Token (LGPT), a novel approach addressing scalability and information loss in graph processing using large language models. By employing learnable parameters as tokens, LGPT enables a flexible representation of graph data, balancing fine-grained and global information. The authors also propose an Early Query Fusion technique to enhance query context integration prior to graph construction. Their method demonstrates a 4.13% improvement on the GraphQA benchmark, achieving better performance without the need for additional training of the language model, which shows promise for handling complex graph-data situations. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the intersection of graph neural networks and language models, an area of increasing importance as graph-structured data proliferates across various domains. The introduction of LGPT as a mechanism to tackle the challenges faced in node-level and graph-level projections is an innovative step. The method's ability to use learnable tokens that enhance both granularity and abstraction in graph representation is an intriguing development that could improve the adaptability and effectiveness of large language models in graph-centric applications. Another strength is the Early Query Fusion technique, which adds a layer of efficiency by ensuring that the query context is linearly integrated into graph representation before any further transformations. This addition has the potential to streamline processing and provide insights that are crucial for tasks reliant on effective graph embeddings. However, there are some weaknesses worth noting. While the performance improvement reported is significant, the practical implications of LGPT, such as its scalability in real-world applications, need more extensive empirical validation. Furthermore, since the improvement is predicated on a specific benchmark (GraphQA), broader applicability and comparative studies against other state-of-the-art methods could strengthen the paper's claims. Despite these weaknesses, the innovative approach and the potential impact on both the fields of graph processing and language model utilization merit a favorable assessment of this work.  **Score: 7**  Justification for this score incorporates the paper's strong novelty in introducing learnable tokens for graph representations and the complementing query fusion technique. However, the score reflects a critical analysis of the need for further empirical validation and exploration beyond benchmark-specific results, indicating room for improvement in establishing broader significance in practical applications.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17581v1)
- **Authors**: Amey Hengle, Aswini Kumar, Anil Bandhakavi, Tanmoy Chakraborty
- **Abstract**: Counterspeech has been popular as an effective approach to counter online hate speech, leading to increasing research interest in automated counterspeech generation using language models. However, this field lacks standardised evaluation protocols and robust automated evaluation metrics that align with human judgement. Current automatic evaluation methods, primarily based on similarity metrics, do not effectively capture the complex and independent attributes of counterspeech quality, such as contextual relevance, aggressiveness, or argumentative coherence. This has led to an increased dependency on labor-intensive human evaluations to assess automated counter-speech generation methods. To address these challenges, we introduce CSEval, a novel dataset and framework for evaluating counterspeech quality across four dimensions: contextual-relevance, aggressiveness, argument-coherence, and suitableness. Furthermore, we propose Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), a prompt-based method with auto-calibrated chain-of-thoughts (CoT) for scoring counterspeech using large language models. Our experiments show that ACE outperforms traditional metrics like ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore in correlating with human judgement, indicating a significant advancement in automated counterspeech evaluation.

The authors introduce a new dataset and a framework, CSEval, that assesses counterspeech quality through four dimensions: contextual relevance, aggressiveness, argument coherence, and suitability. To further improve evaluation accuracy, they propose a method called Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE), which utilizes large language models and a prompt-based approach for scoring. Their experiments demonstrate that ACE significantly outperforms commonly used evaluation metrics such as ROUGE, METEOR, and BertScore, correlating better with human judgments. --- **Evaluation of the Paper’s Novelty and Significance:** The paper presents several noteworthy contributions to the field of automated counterspeech generation.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Framework Introduction:** CSEval's multi-dimensional approach represents a significant advancement in the evaluation of counterspeech. By focusing on specific attributes like contextual relevance and aggressiveness, the framework acknowledges the complexity of effective counterspeech, which is often overlooked in conventional metrics. 2. **Innovative Methodology:** The Auto-Calibrated COT for Counterspeech Evaluation (ACE) offers a fresh take on prompts and chain-of-thought reasoning, harnessing the power of large language models to improve alignment with human evaluative standards. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide empirical evidence showing that ACE outperforms traditional metrics, which bolsters the credibility and usefulness of their proposed evaluation method. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** The dataset and evaluation framework’s robustness may be questioned; if the dataset is limited in diversity or context, it may affect the generalizability of ACE beyond the specific instances evaluated. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The prompt-based ACE method may require substantial tuning and understanding of large language models, which could limit accessibility for less experienced researchers or practitioners. **Impact and Potential Influence:** This work is poised to influence the field significantly by providing a structured way to evaluate the quality of counterspeech automatically. This not only addresses the urgent need for efficient and robust evaluation metrics in a rapidly evolving space of hate speech prevention but also encourages further research into automated evaluation across dimensions not previously considered. **Score Justification:** The combination of innovative framework design and empirical results indicates a notable contribution to the field. However, potential generalizability issues and the complexity of implementation are concerns that temper the overall impact. Balancing these strengths and weaknesses leads to a well-considered evaluation score. Score: 8

### Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models for Semi-supervised Sentiment Analysis
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17598v1)
- **Authors**: Kunrong Li, Xinyu Liu, Zhen Chen
- **Abstract**: Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market trends, and detecting public sentiment. However, manually annotating large sentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a semi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task. Although some methods have been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the intrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of the NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis scenario and may prone to overfit. Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text, we propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models (SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis. We introduce two prompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. The first is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities and numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual information. The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly queries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction. Subsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with confidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to provide additional supervision signals during training. Furthermore, to fully utilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling strategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem. Experiments show our method achieves remarkable performance over prior semi-supervised methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel semi-supervised method for sentiment analysis utilizing large language models (LLMs) through a framework known as Semantic Consistency Regularization (SCR). Given the challenges of manual annotation in sentiment analysis, the authors propose two prompting strategies to enhance the semantic quality of unlabeled text: Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE) and Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE). The SCR framework employs LLMs to reconstruct textual information, leveraging this improved data to establish a consistency loss that incorporates a confidence thresholding mechanism to focus on high-quality samples. Additionally, the paper introduces a class re-assembling strategy that optimally uses uncertain data samples. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing semi-supervised techniques for sentiment analysis. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper resides primarily in its innovative integration of LLMs for enhancing unlabeled text in the sentiment analysis domain, applying techniques that have not been extensively explored in previous semi-supervised methods. The two prompting strategies introduced provide a practical framework for capitalizing on the strengths of LLMs, making the approach relevant given the widespread reliance on textual data across industries. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The integration of semantic consistency via LLMs and the strategies to enhance unlabeled data are novel contributions that position the work at the forefront of sentiment analysis techniques. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The experimental results not only showcase superior performance but also provide insights into the effectiveness of the proposed methods over traditional semi-supervised approaches. 3. **Addressing Practical Challenges:** The proposed framework addresses the significant practical challenge of laborious data annotation, thereby advancing the applicability of sentiment analysis in real-world scenarios. However, there are notable weaknesses as well: 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the methods are promising, the generalizability to other domains beyond sentiment analysis is not fully explored, limiting the impact of the findings. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The reliance on LLMs may introduce complexity in terms of computational costs and resource requirements, which could hinder adoption in resource-constrained environments. 3. **Exploration of Overfitting:** The paper touches on issues of model overfitting with existing approaches but does not provide extensive empirical evidence or a detailed discussion on this front, which could strengthen the claims made about the advantages of SCR. Overall, the paper makes a credible contribution to the field of natural language processing by applying cutting-edge techniques to improve sentiment analysis. It sets the groundwork for further research into semi-supervised learning approaches but does leave room for exploration regarding broader applications and practical implementation challenges. **Score: 8**

### Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17617v1)
- **Authors**: Jonathan Teel, Jocasta Cumberbatch, Raphael Benington, Quentin Baskerville
- **Abstract**: Extended sequence generation often leads to degradation in contextual consistency due to the inability of conventional self-attention mechanisms to effectively retain long-range dependencies. Existing approaches, including memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning, introduce computational trade-offs that either increase inference latency or impose additional storage overhead. Structured Context Recomposition (SCR) introduces a probabilistic layer realignment strategy that dynamically adjusts learned representations within transformer layers, ensuring that semantically relevant embeddings persist throughout extended transformations. The proposed method enhances coherence retention through a recursive weighting function that redistributes representational emphasis based on inferred contextual relevance rather than relying on fixed token-level attention scores. Empirical results indicate that probabilistic realignment mitigates abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, particularly in scenarios where sequences exceed standard attention window constraints. Sequence-level entropy analysis further reveals that SCR moderates representational variability without introducing excessive output regularization, allowing models to sustain generative diversity while preserving contextual alignment. Attention head deviation measurements confirm that hierarchical reweighting contributes to smoother token dependency transitions across transformer layers, reinforcing the stability of multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning. Computational resource assessments show that while SCR incurs a moderate increase in processing time, memory overhead remains within feasible limits, making it suitable for practical deployment in autoregressive generative applications.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Structured Context Recomposition for Large Language Models Using Probabilistic Layer Realignment" addresses a significant limitation in large language models (LLMs) concerning the retention of contextual consistency during extended sequence generation. Traditional self-attention mechanisms struggle with maintaining long-range dependencies, leading to issues such as abrupt topic shifts and logical inconsistencies, which can degrade the quality of generated text.  The authors propose a novel technique called Structured Context Recomposition (SCR), which employs a probabilistic layer realignment strategy to dynamically adjust the representations within transformer layers. This approach focuses on ensuring that semantically relevant embeddings persist through extended transformations, contrasting with existing methods that often add computational overhead or increase latency. Key contributions of SCR include: 1. A recursive weighting function that prioritizes contextual relevance over static attention weights. 2. Empirical results showing improved coherence retention and reduced representational variability during long sequence generations. 3. Attention head deviation metrics indicating smoother transitions in token dependencies due to hierarchical reweighting. 4. An evaluation of computational resources showing SCR is feasible for practical applications despite a noted moderate increase in processing time. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: SCR's approach to dynamically adjusting representations is a fresh perspective on mitigating contextual degradation in LLMs. The probabilistic layer realignment introduces a novel mechanism that may provide significant advantages over traditional fixed attention mechanisms.    2. **Empirical Validation**: The empirical results are compelling, with clear evidence of improvements in coherence and context retention. This provides a robust foundation for the proposed methodology's effectiveness. 3. **Balanced Resource Management**: The paper thoughtfully addresses computational cost, which is a critical factor in deploying LLMs. By ensuring that memory overhead remains feasible, the authors suggest a pragmatic pathway for implementation. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity**: The probabilistic layer realignment and recursive weighting function may add complexity to model interpretation and deployment. The increased processing time, while manageable, still raises questions about efficiency compared to other state-of-the-art methods. 2. **Generality**: While the results are promising, the scope of evaluation appears narrow, potentially limiting the generalizability across various domains or different architectures of LLMs. Further validation in diverse contexts would strengthen the findings. 3. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art**: The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparative analysis against existing techniques, such as memory mechanisms and retrieval-augmented approaches, to better highlight the advantages of SCR. **Score Justification:** Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in addressing a well-recognized challenge in large language model architecture. The combination of theoretical innovation, empirical support, and practical considerations suggest a valuable contribution to the field of natural language processing. However, the complexity of the approach and the need for further validation limit the potential to achieve transformative results universally across models.  **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Sharon Temtsin, Diane Proudfoot, David Kaber, Christoph Bartneck
- **Abstract**: The current cycle of hype and anxiety concerning the benefits and risks to human society of Artificial Intelligence is fuelled, not only by the increasing use of generative AI and other AI tools by the general public, but also by claims made on behalf of such technology by popularizers and scientists. In particular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can pass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can "think". Large-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed examination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's original instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with GPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player imitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's instructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a Computer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and conducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one participant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most advanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent extravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either optimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "The Imitation Game According To Turing" critiques the recent claims that Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly GPT-4-Turbo, can pass the Turing Test, traditionally established by Alan Turing in the 1950s. The authors argue that many contemporary studies claiming success in this area have misapplied Turing's original parameters. To investigate, the authors conducted a methodologically sound study—an imitation game adhering closely to Turing's specifications—where they found that participants largely identified the LLM, suggesting it cannot genuinely pass the Turing Test. The authors conclude that the current claims regarding the capabilities and implications of LLMs are misguided and overly optimistic. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper addresses a timely and critical debate regarding the capabilities of AI, particularly LLMs. While discussions on the Turing Test are not new, the authors' decision to rigorously apply Turing's original criteria to contemporary technology presents a novel perspective. By conducting carefully designed tests to challenge recent claims, the paper fills an important gap in the literature. **Significance:** The implications of the findings are significant, as they challenge the prevailing narrative that LLMs exhibit human-like understanding or "thinking." The results can influence AI research, public discourse, and policy-making by tempering expectations about the socio-economic impacts of AI. **Strengths:** 1. **Rigorous Methodology:** The authors adhered closely to Turing's original test conditions and sought to address ambiguities in his instructions.  2. **Clarity and Relevance:** The paper is well-structured, making its arguments clear and relevant to ongoing debates in AI. 3. **Critical Engagement:** It engages critically with recent claims about AI's capabilities, contributing to a more scientifically grounded understanding. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Sample Size and Generalizability:** The details regarding the sample size and diversity of participants in the Turing Test are not provided, which may impact the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Limited Scope:** While the paper focuses on LLMs, it does not consider other AI models and methods that may exhibit different capabilities, which could offer a more nuanced view of AI performance. **Potential Influence:** The paper's findings could lead to a reevaluation of how AI capabilities are assessed and the validity of purported advancements in AI. It calls attention to the need for rigorous testing and verification of AI models, potentially influencing future research standards and public understanding. **Score: 8**   This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, as the paper not only critiques misconceptions about AI but also reinforces the importance of adhering to foundational algorithms and testing protocols. However, the arguments could be made even more robust with a broader assessment of AI capabilities beyond just LLMs, thus preventing a full score.

The authors propose a decomposition of predictive uncertainty into recommendation uncertainty and prompt uncertainty, allowing researchers to pinpoint the origins of uncertainty more effectively. The study includes extensive experiments that show how predictive uncertainty correlates with recommendation reliability, investigates the sources of this uncertainty through decomposed metrics, and introduces strategies for uncertainty-aware prompting to improve recommendation reliability. Additionally, the authors provide access to their source code and model weights online for further research. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a significant gap in the deployment of LLMs for recommendation tasks—specifically the uncertainty in their outputs. This focus on uncertainty quantification is both timely and relevant, particularly as reliance on LLMs across various applications has escalated. By proposing a structured approach to understanding and mitigating uncertainties, the authors contribute to the broader conversation around the responsible use of AI technologies, marking an important stride towards enhancing the robustness of AI-based systems. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Framework:** The introduction of a decomposition approach for uncertainty quantification is a novel contribution, providing a more granular understanding of where uncertainties arise. 2. **Experimental Validation:** The paper supports its theoretical propositions with empirical experiments, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed measures in indicating recommendation reliability. 3. **Practical Applications:** The suggestion of uncertainty-aware prompting has the potential to influence how LLMs can be effectively utilized in practice, making recommendations more trustworthy. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Experiments:** Although extensive, the experiments might benefit from diverse datasets and real-world contexts to validate the generalization of the findings. 2. **Limited Discussion on Implications:** The paper could delve deeper into the implications of its findings for practitioners and policymakers in the domain of AI ethics and reliable AI systems. 3. **Technical Complexity:** While the novelty is acknowledged, the technical framework may be complex for practitioners who are not deeply familiar with the intricacies of LLMs and uncertainty quantification, potentially limiting adoption. **Overall Influence:** The paper stands to make a meaningful impact on both academic research and practical deployment of LLMs in recommendation systems by shining a light on an underexplored area. Providing a pathway to evaluate and enhance the reliability of LLM outputs could lead to broader trust and acceptance of AI in recommendation tasks. **Score: 8** The score reflects the paper’s innovative framework and practical implications, balanced against some limitations in experimental breadth and practical accessibility.

- **Authors**: Yihua Shao, Minxi Yan, Yang Liu, Siyu Chen, Wenjie Chen, Xinwei Long, Ziyang Yan, Lei Li, Chenyu Zhang, Nicu Sebe, Hao Tang, Yan Wang, Hao Zhao, Mengzhu Wang, Jingcai Guo
- **Abstract**: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities for task specific fine-tuning. However, in scenarios that involve multiple tasks, training a separate LoRA model for each one results in considerable inefficiency in terms of storage and inference. Moreover, existing parameter generation methods fail to capture the correlations among these tasks, making multi-task LoRA parameter generation challenging. To address these limitations, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel approach that efficiently achieves task-specific customization of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we use training data from all tasks to train a tailored generator, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE). CVAE takes task descriptions as inputs and produces task-aware LoRA weights as outputs. These LoRA weights are then merged with LLMs to create task-specialized models without the need for additional fine-tuning. Furthermore, we utilize in-context meta-learning for knowledge enhancement and task mapping, to capture the relationship between tasks and parameter distributions. As a result, our method achieves more accurate LoRA parameter generation for diverse tasks using CVAE. ICM-LoRA enables more accurate LoRA parameter reconstruction than current parameter reconstruction methods and is useful for implementing task-specific enhancements of LoRA parameters. At the same time, our method occupies 283MB, only 1\% storage compared with the original LoRA.
- **Summary**: **Summary of "In-Context Meta LoRA Generation":** The paper introduces In-Context Meta LoRA (ICM-LoRA), a novel method aimed at enhancing the efficiency of Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models for multi-task scenarios involving large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches necessitate training separate LoRA models for each task, resulting in significant inefficiencies in storage and inference. In contrast, ICM-LoRA utilizes a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) trained with data from multiple tasks to generate task-specific LoRA weights based on task descriptions. This approach not only eliminates the requirement for additional fine-tuning but also employs in-context meta-learning to better understand task relationships and parameter distributions. ICM-LoRA stands out by achieving improved accuracy in reconstructing LoRA parameters while maintaining a significantly smaller storage footprint (283MB, or roughly 1% of traditional LoRA models). **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The concept of using CVAE for generating task-aware LoRA weights is innovative and addresses a crucial issue in the scalability of task-specific fine-tuning for LLMs. The integration of in-context meta-learning to enhance knowledge acquisition and task mapping adds an additional layer of sophistication that is not typically found in standard adaptation techniques. The ability to consolidate adaptations significantly bolsters the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world scenarios where multiple tasks must be managed without overwhelming resource requirements. **Strengths:** - **Efficiency**: The proposed method drastically reduces storage needs and computational overhead, making it more feasible to deploy LLMs across varied tasks. - **Task Correlation Handling**: By capturing task correlations, ICM-LoRA shows promise in producing more generalized and effective LoRA parameters. - **Practical Applicability**: The focus on minimizing additional fine-tuning aligns with the growing demands for agile model deployment in industry settings. **Weaknesses:** - **Scalability Beyond Multi-Task Problems**: While the method excels in multi-task scenarios, its performance in contexts where tasks are vastly different or underrepresented in training data remains to be seen. - **Complexity**: The introduction of meta-learning components may complicate the model training and deployment processes, potentially limiting accessibility for practitioners not versed in advanced ML techniques. **Conclusion:** In summary, "In-Context Meta LoRA Generation" provides an important contribution to the field of machine learning, particularly in the realm of fine-tuning methodologies for LLMs. Its innovative approach to generating task-specific adaptations while addressing efficiency issues holds significant promise for broader applications. Nevertheless, questions regarding its adaptability to diverse or unbalanced task distributions suggest the need for further research. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial advancements in efficiency and functionality for LoRA models, balanced by some concerns regarding the method's broader applicability and complexity in execution. Overall, it represents a commendable step forward in task-specific model adaptation techniques.

- **Authors**: Jakub Adamczyk, Piotr Ludynia, Wojciech Czech
- **Abstract**: We study the effectiveness of molecular fingerprints for peptide property prediction and demonstrate that domain-specific feature extraction from molecular graphs can outperform complex and computationally expensive models such as GNNs, pretrained sequence-based transformers and multimodal ensembles, even without hyperparameter tuning. To this end, we perform a thorough evaluation on 126 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on LRGB and 5 other peptide function prediction benchmarks. We show that models based on count variants of ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit molecular fingerprints and LightGBM as classification head are remarkably robust. The strong performance of molecular fingerprints, which are intrinsically very short-range feature encoders, challenges the presumed importance of long-range interactions in peptides. Our conclusion is that the use of molecular fingerprints for larger molecules, such as peptides, can be a computationally feasible, low-parameter, and versatile alternative to sophisticated deep learning models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the use of molecular fingerprints for predicting peptide functions, proposing that specialized feature extraction from molecular graphs can outperform more complicated models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformers. Through extensive evaluation across 126 datasets, it achieves state-of-the-art results in predicting peptide properties, notably outshining established benchmarks. The authors demonstrate that simple models using count variants of ECFP, Topological Torsion, and RDKit fingerprints combined with a LightGBM classifier yield strong performance, arguing that the dominance of short-range feature encoders challenges the traditional view of the significance of long-range interactions in peptides. Consequently, they assert that molecular fingerprints represent a computationally efficient and low-parameter alternative to complex deep learning approaches for larger biomolecules. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Performance Validation:** The study's thorough evaluation across 126 datasets gives a solid empirical foundation to its claims about the efficacy of molecular fingerprints. Achieving state-of-the-art results in peptide prediction is a significant contribution.    2. **Practical Implications:** By highlighting the efficiency of molecular fingerprints versus more resource-intensive models, the paper addresses a crucial concern in computational biology regarding the balance between model complexity and performance.  3. **Challenge to Existing Paradigms:** The authors present a compelling argument against the common sense that long-range interactions are pivotal for peptide function, suggesting that short-range interactions may suffice for effective prediction. This could shift research focus in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Novelty in Methodology:** While the findings are impactful, the use of molecular fingerprints is not inherently novel; existing literature has explored their effectiveness before. The paper does not propose fundamentally new methods but rather shows their superiority in a new context. 2. **Limited Discussion on Mechanisms:** The paper lacks depth in explaining why short-range feature encoders can be so effective. This omission leaves room for further investigation and could limit the theoretical understanding of peptide interactions. 3. **Hyperparameter Lack:** While avoiding hyperparameter tuning shows robustness, it also raises questions about the model's adaptability and generalizability across differing domains or applications. **Potential Influence:** The results may encourage researchers to reconsider their modeling strategies, especially in resource-constrained environments, but the reliance on established methodologies may restrict broader acceptance as a groundbreaking shift in the field. Additionally, the challenge to existing paradigms is significant, yet how it resonates within the wider computational biology community may take time to flourish. ### Score: 7 The paper makes an important contribution by showcasing the effectiveness of molecular fingerprints in peptide function prediction, asserting the necessity to reevaluate the role of molecular complexity in modeling. However, its methodological approach and the lack of novelty in the fundamental techniques used somewhat temper its impact. While the challenge to conventional thinking is valuable, the need for deeper mechanical explanations and theoretical insights presents areas for further research to reinforce the significance of the findings.

### DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17905v1)
- **Authors**: Mingkuan Feng, Jinyang Wu, Shuai Zhang, Pengpeng Shao, Ruihan Jin, Zhengqi Wen, Jianhua Tao, Feihu Che
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models" addresses the challenge of high computational and memory costs associated with the growing scale of large language models (LLMs). The authors highlight that existing pruning techniques, which generally utilize a prune-then-finetune approach, often lead to significant performance degradation because valuable information resides in the pruned components. To circumvent this issue, the authors introduce a novel paradigm where they first regularize, then prune, and finally finetune the models. The proposed method, DReSS, involves using a small dataset to guide the regularization of components prior to pruning, effectively retaining critical information and improving performance. The paper claims that DReSS achieves superior results in terms of language modeling performance, latency reduction, and increased throughput, especially under high pruning ratios, compared to traditional methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its proposed method of reordering the pruning process by incorporating regularization before pruning. This approach reflects an innovative problem-solving perspective, aiming to minimize information loss during the pruning phase. The method's reliance on a small amount of data for regularization is a beneficial feature, making the technique adaptable and potentially applicable in scenarios with limited data. The authors provide empirical evidence to support their claims and demonstrate that DReSS substantially outperforms existing techniques. However, some weaknesses are present. First, while the idea of pre-regularization is conceptually strong, the paper could benefit from more extensive analysis of different datasets and LLM architectures to validate the generalizability of DReSS. Additionally, the lack of comparison against other advanced compression techniques aside from traditional pruning methods may limit the scope of its claimed benefits. Furthermore, the practical implementation of DReSS may still involve computational overhead that could offset the advantages gained from reduced performance recovery time. Despite these limitations, the paper's contributions are significant, particularly in a field where efficiency and scalability are critical. By addressing a key challenge in LLMs, DReSS carries the potential to influence future research directions and applications in natural language processing. **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field, highlighting both innovation in methodology and practical implications. However, the scope of experimentation and comparative analysis could be broadened for an even higher impact assessment.

- **Abstract**: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into educational technology, their potential to assist in developing curricula has gained interest among educators. Despite this growing attention, their applicability in culturally responsive Indigenous educational settings like Hawai`i's public schools and Kaiapuni (immersion language) programs, remains understudied. Additionally, `Olelo Hawai`i, the Hawaiian language, as a low-resource language, poses unique challenges and concerns about cultural sensitivity and the reliability of generated content. Through surveys and interviews with kumu (educators), this study explores the perceived benefits and limitations of using LLMs for culturally revitalizing computer science (CS) education in Hawaiian public schools with Kaiapuni programs. Our findings highlight AI's time-saving advantages while exposing challenges such as cultural misalignment and reliability concerns. We conclude with design recommendations for future AI tools to better align with Hawaiian cultural values and pedagogical practices, towards the broader goal of trustworthy, effective, and culturally grounded AI technologies.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "I Would Never Trust Anything Western" investigates the perspectives of kumu (educators) on the use of large language models (LLMs) in revitalizing computer science (CS) education within Hawaiian public schools, particularly those that function in Kaiapuni programs. The study addresses the increasing integration of LLMs in educational technology, while specifically focusing on their application in culturally responsive Indigenous settings, which has been largely neglected in existing literature. Through a combination of surveys and interviews with educators, the research delineates both the benefits—such as time savings—and the limitations associated with LLMs, particularly the issues of cultural misalignment and content reliability when dealing with `Olelo Hawai`i, a language with limited resources. The study culminates in design recommendations aimed at enhancing the alignment of AI tools with Hawaiian cultural values and educational practices, ultimately targeting the development of trustworthy AI technologies. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Gap**: This paper tackles an under-explored area in educational technology by studying the application of LLMs in a specific Indigenous context. This is significant as most existing research focuses on mainstream educational frameworks that do not account for unique cultural considerations. 2. **Cultural Responsiveness**: The emphasis on culturally responsive pedagogy marks this paper as an important contribution, advocating for tools that not only assist in education but are also sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of the community. 3. **Multiple Perspectives**: Engaging directly with kumu through surveys and interviews enhances the credibility of the findings and allows for a more nuanced understanding of the educators' experiences and insights. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Discussion**: While it offers important insights, the paper would benefit from a broader discussion about the implications of LLMs across diverse Indigenous contexts, thus situating its findings within a wider framework of educational technology. 2. **Reliability Measures**: The paper identifies issues of reliability but does not provide sufficient detail on how these challenges can be effectively addressed or mitigated in practice. 3. **Focused On Limitations**: Much of the discussion revolves around the limitations and risks of LLMs, with less emphasis on practical integration strategies that educators could employ within their curricula. **Overall Impact**: This paper contributes valuable perspectives on the intersection of AI and culturally focused education, pushing forward the dialogue on the responsible use of technology in teaching. It holds potential for influencing design innovations in educational tools, tailored for Indigenous settings. Given the rigorous examination of cultural considerations, coupled with direct feedback from educators, the study makes a noteworthy contribution, particularly within the niche of educational technology in Indigenous contexts. However, its impact could be broadened by providing more actionable insights.  **Score**: 7

### Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17974v1)
- **Authors**: Zishun Yu, Tengyu Xu, Di Jin, Karthik Abinav Sankararaman, Yun He, Wenxuan Zhou, Zhouhao Zeng, Eryk Helenowski, Chen Zhu, Sinong Wang, Hao Ma, Han Fang
- **Abstract**: Solving mathematics problems has been an intriguing capability of large language models, and many efforts have been made to improve reasoning by extending reasoning length, such as through self-correction and extensive long chain-of-thoughts. While promising in problem-solving, advanced long reasoning chain models exhibit an undesired single-modal behavior, where trivial questions require unnecessarily tedious long chains of thought. In this work, we propose a way to allow models to be aware of inference budgets by formulating it as utility maximization with respect to an inference budget constraint, hence naming our algorithm Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO). In a nutshell, models fine-tuned through IBPO learn to ``understand'' the difficulty of queries and allocate inference budgets to harder ones. With different inference budgets, our best models are able to have a $4.14$\% and $5.74$\% absolute improvement ($8.08$\% and $11.2$\% relative improvement) on MATH500 using $2.16$x and $4.32$x inference budgets respectively, relative to LLaMA3.1 8B Instruct. These improvements are approximately $2$x those of self-consistency under the same budgets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Think Smarter not Harder: Adaptive Reasoning with Inference Aware Optimization" presents a novel algorithm called Inference Budget-Constrained Policy Optimization (IBPO) designed to enhance the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in mathematical reasoning tasks. The primary issue addressed in the paper is the inefficiency of long reasoning chains that arise in response to trivial questions, which can lead to unnecessary complexity in solutions. IBPO allows models to balance the difficulty of queries with the amount of reasoning effort by formulating reasoning as a utility maximization problem constrained by an inference budget. The results demonstrate that models fine-tuned with IBPO outperform existing models on the MATH500 dataset, achieving significant improvements under varying inference budgets, and these gains are notably higher than those accomplished via traditional self-consistency methods. **Evaluation:** **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The concept of an inference budget is a fresh addition to the field of LLMs, introducing a mechanism for adaptive reasoning. This approach allows the model to allocate its cognitive resources (inference budget) appropriately based on the complexity of the task, potentially revolutionizing how reasoning in LLMs is approached. 2. **Empirical Results**: The variation in performance improvements across different inference budgets showcases a clear validation of the proposed method, emphasizing its practical applicability and indicating substantial potential for enhancing LLM performance on complex tasks. 3. **Targeted Problem**: The paper addresses a specific limitation of existing models (tedious reasoning chains for simple questions), which is pertinent to both practitioners and researchers in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Implementation Generality**: While the approach is promising, the paper could further explore the generalizability of IBPO across different tasks and types of models, as its current focus on mathematical reasoning may limit the broader applicability of the findings. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: Although self-consistency is mentioned as a comparison, a more comprehensive evaluation against a wider array of benchmarks and existing optimization techniques would strengthen the argument for IBPO's superiority. 3. **Complexity vs. Performance Trade-off**: The paper does not delve deeply into potential trade-offs associated with this budget allocation strategy, such as computational overhead or operational limits that may arise in practice when implementing IBPO. Overall, the paper presents a significant advancement in adaptive reasoning for LLMs but leaves room for further exploration into its implications across various contexts. **Score: 8** The score reflects the innovative nature of the IBPO approach, alongside solid empirical validation that enhances mathematical problem-solving capability while addressing a prominent issue in LLM usage. However, the generalizability and comparative depth could be further explored to maximize its impact and relevance across a larger scope of applications within the field.

### InnerThoughts: Disentangling Representations and Predictions in Large Language Models

- **Authors**: Didier Chételat, Joseph Cotnareanu, Rylee Thompson, Yingxue Zhang, Mark Coates
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) contain substantial factual knowledge which is commonly elicited by multiple-choice question-answering prompts. Internally, such models process the prompt through multiple transformer layers, building varying representations of the problem within its hidden states. Ultimately, however, only the hidden state corresponding to the final layer and token position are used to predict the answer label. In this work, we propose instead to learn a small separate neural network predictor module on a collection of training questions, that take the hidden states from all the layers at the last temporal position as input and outputs predictions. In effect, such a framework disentangles the representational abilities of LLMs from their predictive abilities. On a collection of hard benchmarks, our method achieves considerable improvements in performance, sometimes comparable to supervised fine-tuning procedures, but at a fraction of the computational cost.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "InnerThoughts: Disentangling Representations and Predictions in Large Language Models" addresses the internal workings of large language models (LLMs) when faced with multiple-choice question-answering tasks. The authors highlight that LLMs contain rich factual knowledge but typically utilize only the final hidden state for prediction purposes. To improve performance, they propose a new approach by introducing a small separate neural network that leverages hidden states from all layers at the final timestep, allowing for a more nuanced representation that disentangles representational and predictive capabilities. Their experimental results demonstrate notable performance improvements on challenging benchmarks, rivaling those achieved through more computationally intensive supervised fine-tuning methods. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The core novelty of the paper lies in its approach to combine all hidden states from different transformer layers for prediction, rather than relying solely on the final layer's output. This method offers a fresh perspective in the analysis and utilization of the internal representations in LLMs. However, the idea of utilizing intermediate representations is not entirely new, as other research has touched on related concepts involving attention mechanisms or multi-layer outputs in various contexts. Therefore, while the proposal does present an innovative methodology, it can be seen as an evolution of established techniques in this area. **Significance:** The significance of the findings is substantial, especially for applications in natural language processing where computational efficiency and effectiveness are crucial. By achieving similar performance to fine-tuning but with less computational overhead, the work addresses a pressing need in the field for more efficient model utilization.  **Strengths:** 1. **Efficient Prediction Mechanism:** The proposed method demonstrates a clear path to enhancing predictive performance without extensive computational costs, making it attractive for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments. 2. **Strong Empirical Evidence:** The authors provide robust experimental results that validate their approach against established benchmarks, suggesting practical applicability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Exploration of Representational Richness:** While the method successfully disentangles representations and predictions, it does not extensively explore how varying representations could be leveraged under different contexts or tasks beyond multiple-choice questions. 2. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** Although the paper highlights its advantages, further comparison with other innovative methods in the literature could strengthen the argument for its novelty and efficacy.  **Potential Influence:** The work has the potential to influence further research on LLMs by encouraging a shift towards exploring intermediate representations. It also opens avenues for more efficient model design and training practices, addressing the constraints faced by many in deploying large-scale models. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's solid methodological contribution and empirical results, while acknowledging its reliance on an existing body of literature regarding the use of hidden representations. The significant performance improvements achieved in a cost-effective manner contribute positively, yet the work's overall impact would be enhanced through further exploration of its implications and more extensive comparative studies.

### Fault Localization via Fine-tuning Large Language Models with Mutation Generated Stack Traces
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18005v1)
- **Authors**: Neetha Jambigi, Bartosz Bogacz, Moritz Mueller, Thomas Bach, Michael Felderer
- **Abstract**: Abrupt and unexpected terminations of software are termed as software crashes. They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel approach for fault localization in software crashes, aiming to address the challenges of analyzing unexpected terminations in production environments, which provide limited data (e.g., only crash logs and stack traces). The authors fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on a dataset augmented with synthetic crash data generated from code mutations, allowing the model to learn to predict the root cause of software crashes solely using stack trace information. The methodology successfully predicts the root cause of crashes with an accuracy of 66.9%, significantly outperforming baseline methods (12.6% and 10.6%). The approach's generalizability is supported by evaluations on additional datasets—SQLite and DuckDB—demonstrating solid performance (63% and 74% accuracy, respectively). The results indicate that fine-tuning LLMs is more effective than using non-finetuned prompting methods for fault localization. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its unique approach to utilizing large language models for fault localization without requiring comprehensive runtime data, which is a common limitation in existing methods. The innovative use of synthetic data generated through code mutations to augment the training set is significant, as it enables the model to learn from a much larger and more diverse set of crash examples than would otherwise be available in historical data. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** Using LLMs for fault localization by focusing solely on stack traces represents a fresh perspective in tackling this longstanding problem. 2. **Data Augmentation Technique:** The paper’s strategy to create synthetic crashes through code mutations is well-conceived, addressing data scarcity effectively. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The reported accuracy improvements are compelling, and the validation on multiple datasets showcases the robustness and applicability of the approach beyond the initial setting. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability Concerns:** While the approach shows promising results on a few datasets, it is not clear how well the method would perform across various types of software applications or in different programming languages. 2. **Real-World Integration:** The paper may not sufficiently address the practical integration of this fault localization technique within existing software development workflows. 3. **Potential Overfitting:** There might be concerns regarding the model's reliance on synthetic data that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world crashes, possibly leading to overfitting. Overall, the paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the field by advancing the use of LLMs in the specific domain of software fault localization through an innovative, data-driven approach. The results are promising, suggesting that this methodology could influence future research and practices within software engineering.  Based on these strengths and weaknesses, I would assign a score of **8**.

### Large Language Models Think Too Fast To Explore Effectively
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18009v1)
- **Authors**: Lan Pan, Hanbo Xie, Robert C. Wilson
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models have emerged many intellectual capacities. While numerous benchmarks assess their intelligence, limited attention has been given to their ability to explore, an essential capacity for discovering new information and adapting to novel environments in both natural and artificial systems. The extent to which LLMs can effectively explore, particularly in open-ended tasks, remains unclear. This study investigates whether LLMs can surpass humans in exploration during an open-ended task, using Little Alchemy 2 as a paradigm, where agents combine elements to discover new ones. Results show most LLMs underperform compared to humans, except for the o1 model, with those traditional LLMs relying primarily on uncertainty driven strategies, unlike humans who balance uncertainty and empowerment. Representational analysis of the models with Sparse Autoencoders revealed that uncertainty and choices are represented at earlier transformer blocks, while empowerment values are processed later, causing LLMs to think too fast and make premature decisions, hindering effective exploration. These findings shed light on the limitations of LLM exploration and suggest directions for improving their adaptability.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the exploration capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on their performance in an open-ended task using the game Little Alchemy 2. This research contrasts LLMs' exploration strategies, predominantly driven by uncertainty, with those of humans, who utilize a combination of uncertainty and empowerment. The study finds that while most LLMs underperform relative to human participants, the o1 model shows some superiority. The authors use Sparse Autoencoders to analyze model representations, revealing that LLMs process uncertainty and choice at earlier stages than empowerment, leading to hasty decision-making that obstructs effective exploration. The findings illuminate inherent limitations in LLMs' exploratory behavior and propose potential improvements for enhancing adaptability in novel tasks. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its exploration of the intersection between LLM capabilities and their exploration strategies, an area that has received limited attention in existing literature. By using a specific application (Little Alchemy 2), the authors provide a concrete framework to evaluate and compare the exploratory abilities of LLMs to those of humans. The distinction drawn between uncertainty-driven and empowerment-driven exploration offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of model performance. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Original Framework**: The choice of an open-ended task allows for a nuanced assessment of exploratory behavior rather than simply classifying LLMs based on standard benchmarks. 2. **Empirical Findings**: The results provide clear evidence of LLMs' inefficiencies in exploration, contributing a relevant perspective on their operational limits. 3. **Mechanistic Insights**: The use of Sparse Autoencoders lends a deeper understanding of how LLMs process information, highlighting critical delays in decision-making processes. However, there are notable weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: The findings may be limited to the specific game used. Lacking diverse tasks could restrict broader applicability or realizations of the observed behaviors in varied contexts. 2. **Model Comparison**: More detailed comparisons across a broader range of LLMs could strengthen the arguments regarding the o1 model's unique capabilities versus others. 3. **Impact on Future Research**: While the paper identifies limitations, it offers only vague suggestions for improvement, which may hinder future studies from effectively addressing the issues presented. Overall, the paper makes a significant contribution to understanding the limitations of LLMs in exploratory tasks, shedding light on an under-researched area with important implications for future AI development. **Score: 7**   This score reflects the paper's clear originality and contributions to the field while acknowledging limitations in generalizability and depth of future directions for research.

- **Abstract**: Recent hardware advancements in AI Accelerators and GPUs allow to efficiently compute sparse matrix multiplications, especially when 2 out of 4 consecutive weights are set to zero. However, this so-called 2:4 sparsity usually comes at a decreased accuracy of the model. We derive a regularizer that exploits the local correlation of features to find better sparsity masks in trained models. We minimize the regularizer jointly with a local squared loss by deriving the proximal operator for which we show that it has an efficient solution in the 2:4-sparse case. After optimizing the mask, we use maskedgradient updates to further minimize the local squared loss. We illustrate our method on toy problems and apply it to pruning entire large language models up to 70B parameters. On models up to 13B we improve over previous state of the art algorithms, whilst on 70B models we match their performance.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper addresses the challenge of inducing 2:4 sparsity in neural network models, which is desirable for efficient computation on AI accelerators and GPUs. The authors propose a novel regularization technique that leverages local feature correlation to enhance the discovery of sparsity masks. They derive a proximal operator tailored for this regularization that enables efficient optimization specifically in the context of 2:4-sparsity. The optimization process involves minimizing the regularizer in conjunction with a local squared loss function. The proposed method improves the sparsity patterns through masked gradient updates and demonstrates its effectiveness on benchmark toy problems. Furthermore, it is successfully applied to prune large-scale language models with up to 70 billion parameters, achieving competitive performance against existing state-of-the-art methods and improving results on smaller models up to 13 billion parameters. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper presents a unique approach by combining the notions of a proximal operator and 2:4 sparsity, a relatively under-explored area in current machine learning research. The integration of a regularization term that efficiently exploits local correlations is a meaningful step forward in enhancing the sparsity structure while aiming to retain model accuracy.  #### Significance  The significance of this work lies in its practical implications for improving the efficiency of deep learning models without drastically compromising their performance. Given the rising need for resource-efficient models, especially for deployment on edge devices, the proposed methodology fills a crucial gap. The application to large language models further highlights its relevance in contemporary AI research, where model size and efficiency are critical. #### Strengths 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The development of a proximal operator specific to 2:4 sparsity is a noteworthy contribution, highlighting an interesting intersection of optimization and sparsity. 2. **Strong Experimental Results**: The paper provides comprehensive experiments showcasing its method against existing algorithms, demonstrating tangible improvements in both small and large models. 3. **Practical Relevance**: The focus on large-scale models aligns with current trends in AI, making the proposed solution not only theoretically significant but also practically impactful. #### Weaknesses 1. **Limited Theoretical Insights**: While the practical results are compelling, the theoretical foundation could be strengthened. There is less discussion on the mathematical implications or guarantees of performance regarding the derived proximal operator or regularizer. 2. **Generality of Application**: The focus on 2:4 sparsity may limit the broader applicability of the findings. Future research might consider extending this framework to other sparsity patterns for a broader audience. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: Although the results are impressive, a more extensive comparative analysis against a wider array of benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods could further substantiate claims of superiority or parity. ### Final Score Considering the novelty in approach, significance for efficient model deployment, strong experimental results, and the noted weaknesses, the paper deserves recognition for its contribution to the field.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18052v1)
- **Authors**: Bartosz Cywiński, Kamil Deja
- **Abstract**: Recent machine unlearning approaches offer promising solution for removing unwanted concepts from diffusion models. However, traditional methods, which largely rely on fine-tuning, provide little insight into the changes they introduce to the base model, making it unclear whether concepts are truly removed or only masked. In this work, we introduce SAeUron, a novel method leveraging features learned by sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to unlearn unwanted concepts in text-to-image diffusion models. First, we demonstrate that SAEs, trained in an unsupervised manner on activations from multiple denoising timesteps of the diffusion model, capture sparse and interpretable features corresponding to specific concepts. Building on this, we propose a method of selecting concept-specific features. This enables precise interventions on the model's activations to block targeted content while preserving the model's overall performance. Evaluation on the competitive UnlearnCanvas benchmark on object and style unlearning highlights SAeUron's state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we show that with a single SAE, we can remove multiple concepts simultaneously and that in contrast to other methods, SAeUron dismisses the possibility of generating unwanted content, even under adversarial attack.
- **Summary**: **Summary of Paper:** The paper titled "SAeUron: Interpretable Concept Unlearning in Diffusion Models with Sparse Autoencoders" presents a new approach to machine unlearning aimed specifically at modifying diffusion models to eliminate unwanted concepts without compromising overall model performance. Traditional unlearning techniques often utilize fine-tuning but lack interpretability regarding the adjustments made to the base model. SAeUron addresses these limitations by employing sparse autoencoders (SAEs) that are trained on the activations of the diffusion model at different denoising steps. These SAEs capture interpretable, sparse features linked to individual concepts. The authors detail a process for selecting these specific features, thereby allowing for targeted modifications to the model's activations. The effectiveness of the SAeUron method is evaluated using the UnlearnCanvas benchmark, demonstrating its superiority in object and style unlearning tasks. Notably, SAeUron can eliminate multiple unwanted concepts simultaneously while ensuring that the diffusion model does not produce undesirable content, even under adversarial conditions. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** SAeUron stands out in the field of machine unlearning, particularly for diffusion models, through its innovative use of sparse autoencoders. The ability to interpret and selectively unlearn specific concepts offers a novel approach that goes beyond mere fine-tuning. The method introduces a spatial layer of understanding about which features are tied to specific concepts and how they can be executed—an essential aspect of interpretability currently lacking in existing approaches. **Significance:** The significance of the paper lies in its implications for practical applications of diffusion models, especially regarding safety and ethical considerations. The idea of ensuring that a model cannot generate unwanted content has far-reaching consequences in various domains, such as content moderation, image generation, and AI ethics. Furthermore, by addressing the challenge of concept unlearning robustly and effectively, SAeUron aligns with ongoing research trends focused on accountability in AI systems. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of SAEs for unlearning concepts is relatively novel and could lead to more interpretable AI systems. 2. **State-of-the-Art Results:** The demonstration of superior performance on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark is compelling evidence of its effectiveness. 3. **Highly Relevant:** The topic is timely and significant in light of increasing concerns about AI-generated content and model interpretability. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Evaluation:** While the benchmarks used are competitive, the paper could benefit from additional evaluations across a wider variety of diffusion models and concepts to strengthen its claims. 2. **Complexity of Implementation:** The method's reliance on sparse autoencoders may present accessibility challenges for practitioners who may lack experience with this technique. **Conclusion:** SAeUron presents a significant advancement in interpretability and effectiveness of machine unlearning approaches in diffusion models. Its implications for AI safety and performance make it a relevant and timely contribution to the field. However, the evaluation could be broadened and possibly simplified to boost practical applicability. Based on these considerations, I assign a score of **8**. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18056v1)
- **Authors**: Duy A. Nguyen, Rishi Kesav Mohan, Van Yang, Pritom Saha Akash, Kevin Chen-Chuan Chang
- **Abstract**: Query rewriting (QR) is a critical technique in e-commerce search, addressing the lexical gap between user queries and product descriptions to enhance search performance. Existing QR approaches typically fall into two categories: discriminative models and generative methods leveraging large language models (LLMs). Discriminative models often struggle with natural language understanding and offer limited flexibility in rewriting, while generative LLMs, despite producing high-quality rewrites, face high inference latency and cost in online settings. These limitations force offline deployment, making them vulnerable to issues like information staleness and semantic drift. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid pipeline for QR that balances efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach combines offline knowledge distillation to create a lightweight but efficient student model with online reinforcement learning (RL) to refine query rewriting dynamically using real-time feedback. A key innovation is the use of LLMs as simulated human feedback, enabling scalable reward signals and cost-effective evaluation without manual annotations. Experimental results on Amazon ESCI dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, as well as positive feedback from the LLM simulation. This work contributes to advancing LLM capabilities for domain-specific applications, offering a robust solution for dynamic and complex e-commerce search environments.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel hybrid approach for query rewriting (QR) in e-commerce search systems, combining offline knowledge distillation with online reinforcement learning (RL). Existing QR methods, either discriminative or generative, face challenges in terms of performance, flexibility, and scalability. The authors propose a lightweight student model created through knowledge distillation to enhance efficiency while utilizing RL for dynamic updating based on real-time user feedback. This approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) as a source of simulated feedback, allowing for effective reward signal generation without the need for extensive manual annotation. Experimental results indicate substantial enhancements in query relevance, diversity, and adaptability, validating the proposed methodology primarily within the context of the Amazon ESCI dataset. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a significant contribution to the field of query rewriting for e-commerce systems, effectively addressing the limitations of existing models. Its hybrid framework represents a thoughtful integration of techniques that leverage both the strengths of LLMs and the advantages of reinforcement learning, offering a more dynamic solution for real-time applications. By incorporating simulated human feedback from LLMs, the methodology effectively reduces the need for costly and slow manual evaluations, enhancing scalability. However, while the proposed approach shows promise, some weaknesses are present. The reliance on LLMs for simulation may introduce biases reflective of the underlying model's limitations, thus compromising the generalizability of the results. Moreover, the paper's results, although promising, are tested against a specific dataset (Amazon ESCI), which may not comprehensively represent broader e-commerce search scenarios. Furthermore, detailed comparison with other contemporary approaches could provide a clearer picture of the relative performance and novelty of this method. The lack of thorough exploration into the potential drawbacks of the model when deployed in varied real-world settings may also be a concern, as the proposed hybrid model's efficacy may vary across different e-commerce environments or languages. Despite these weaknesses, the innovative blending of distillation and RL sets a new direction in QR research and has potential implications for broader applications in NLP and e-commerce.  Considering all aspects, the paper merits a score reflecting its strong contributions balanced against its limitations. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Spencer Mateega, Carlos Georgescu, Danny Tang
- **Abstract**: FinanceQA is a testing suite that evaluates LLMs' performance on complex numerical financial analysis tasks that mirror real-world investment work. Despite recent advances, current LLMs fail to meet the strict accuracy requirements of financial institutions, with models failing approximately 60% of realistic tasks that mimic on-the-job analyses at hedge funds, private equity firms, investment banks, and other financial institutions. The primary challenges include hand-spreading metrics, adhering to standard accounting and corporate valuation conventions, and performing analysis under incomplete information - particularly in multi-step tasks requiring assumption generation. This performance gap highlights the disconnect between existing LLM capabilities and the demands of professional financial analysis that are inadequately tested by current testing architectures. Results show that higher-quality training data is needed to support such tasks, which we experiment with using OpenAI's fine-tuning API. FinanceQA is publicly released at [this https URL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AfterQuery/FinanceQA).

### Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18081v1)
- **Authors**: Pratik S. Sachdeva, Tom van Nuenen
- **Abstract**: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive research into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of this research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess how well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or political ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to relatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and nuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along more detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better assess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this end, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on everyday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to assign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We then compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to each other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results demonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral judgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit. LLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model agreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in how models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the complexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and the need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical judgment. As LLMs continue to be used in roles requiring ethical decision-making such as therapists and companions, careful evaluation is crucial to mitigate potential biases and limitations.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Normative Evaluation of Large Language Models with Everyday Moral Dilemmas" addresses the limitations of current methods used to assess the moral reasoning of large language models (LLMs). It critiques existing approaches that rely on standardized survey-style questions, arguing that these approaches oversimplify complex moral dilemmas. The authors propose evaluating LLMs using nuanced moral dilemmas sourced from the Reddit "Am I the Asshole" (AITA) community, where individuals seek advice on everyday conflicts. They prompted seven different LLMs to analyze over 10,000 dilemmas, assessing their moral judgments and explanations against those of Redditors and each other. Key findings indicate that LLMs exhibit distinct patterns in moral judgment, with moderate to high consistency within each model but low agreement between models. Furthermore, the models invoke differing moral principles in their reasoning. The paper emphasizes the necessity for detailed evaluations of LLMs to understand their ethical decision-making capabilities, especially as these models are increasingly applied in sensitive roles. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper presents a notable advancement in understanding how LLMs engage with complex ethical reasoning. The novelty lies in its approach to utilize real-world moral dilemmas rather than abstract questions, offering deeper insights into the models' moral alignment with human judgments.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** Leveraging real-world dilemmas from a specific community provides a more authentic context for evaluating LLMs' moral reasoning abilities. 2. **Rich Data Set:** The use of over 10,000 dilemmas enriches the analysis, allowing for substantial comparisons and conclusions about LLM behavior. 3. **Key Findings on Model Agreement:** The discovery of low inter-model agreement is significant, raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in ethical contexts and encouraging further exploration of their limitations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the AITA community offers relevant dilemmas, the findings may not fully represent the diversity of moral reasoning across different cultural or demographic contexts. 2. **Lack of Human Perspective:** The comparison focuses mainly on the LLMs' outputs without thoroughly engaging with the depth of human moral reasoning, which could provide richer insights into contrasts and potential biases. 3. **Limited Scope of Dilemmas:** The complexity and variance in human moral dilemmas cannot be entirely captured by a dataset from one source; thus, the findings may be too narrow. Given these considerations, the paper effectively addresses a critical gap in auditing AI systems while offering a compelling methodology. However, the limitations in scope and context suggest that while the findings are valuable, they should be interpreted cautiously. **Score: 8** This score reflects the paper’s significant contribution to the field by introducing a novel evaluation method and providing crucial insights into LLM moral reasoning. It is a strong increment in the understanding of LLM behavior in ethical contexts but is tempered by concerns regarding generalizability and depth of analysis. It has the potential to influence future research on LLM applications in sensitive roles, but more expansive studies will be needed to fully grasp their implications in diverse real-world scenarios.

### AlphaAdam:Asynchronous Masked Optimization with Dynamic Alpha for Selective Updates
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18094v1)
- **Authors**: Da Chang, Yu Li, Ganzhao Yuan
- **Abstract**: In the training of large language models (LLMs), updating parameters more efficiently and stably has always been an important challenge. To achieve efficient parameter updates, existing methods usually achieve performance comparable to full parameter updates through methods such as low-dimensional decomposition or layer-wise selective updates. In this work, we propose AlphaAdam, an optimization framework for LLM from the perspective of intra-layer parameter updates. By decoupling parameter updates and dynamically adjusting their strength, AlphaAdam accelerates convergence and improves training stability. We construct parameter masks based on the consistency of historical momentum and gradient direction and combine them with an adaptive mask strength strategy to ensure efficient optimization and theoretical convergence guarantees, which is also applicable to most momentum-based optimizers. Extensive experiments show that AlphaAdam outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as AdamW in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency across tasks, including GPT-2 pre-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa and Llama-7B. Our AlphaAdam implements an optimizer enhancement framework for LLMs through intra-layer asynchronous masked adaptive updates. Our code is available in this \href{https://github.com/MaeChd/AlphaAdam}{link}
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces AlphaAdam, an advanced optimization framework designed to enhance the training of large language models (LLMs) through asynchronous masked updates. Traditional methods in LLM training often involve full parameter updates, which can be inefficient. AlphaAdam addresses this challenge by introducing intra-layer parameter updates that dynamically adjust update strength based on historical momentum and gradient direction. The proposed method employs consistency checks to create parameter masks, leading to improved convergence speed and enhanced training stability. Experiments indicate that AlphaAdam surpasses existing optimizers such as AdamW in both convergence performance and computational efficiency across various LLM tasks, including those involving GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Llama-7B. The authors make the implementation of their framework available in a public repository. **Evaluation:** AlphaAdam presents a novel approach to optimizing LLM training by focusing on intra-layer updates and the adaptive adjustment of update strengths. This contrasts with traditional methods that often treat all parameters equally, providing a new perspective that could lead to more efficient parameter updates. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The decoupling of parameter updates and the introduction of adaptive masks show creative thinking around parameter optimization, offering a new mechanism for potentially improving training stability and speed. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The thorough experimentation across multiple high-profile models (GPT-2, RoBERTa, Llama-7B) strengthens the claims made regarding the effectiveness of AlphaAdam, indicating a practical application of the theory. 3. **Code Availability:** By providing accessible code, the authors enhance the reproducibility and applicability of their findings within the research community, fostering further research and development. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Application:** While the paper claims broad applicability, it primarily tests AlphaAdam on a limited number of LLM architectures. The generalizability of the approach to other types of models or training scenarios may be limited. 2. **Comparison Depth:** Although AlphaAdam is shown to outperform AdamW, details on how it compares against other modern optimizers (like LAMB or AdaFactor) are sparse. A more comprehensive comparison could potentially strengthen the argument for its superiority. 3. **Theoretical Analysis:** While convergence guarantees are mentioned, the theoretical foundation could be further articulated, providing deeper insights into the conditions under which AlphaAdam excels. **Potential Influence:** AlphaAdam's focus on efficient and adaptive parameter updates addresses significant challenges in LLM training, which could have implications for future research in this area. If adopted widely, this framework might inspire a shift towards more sophisticated and context-sensitive optimization methods in machine learning. Given these strengths and weaknesses, the paper points to meaningful contributions but also acknowledges limitations in scope and depth of comparative analysis with existing methods. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial novelty in the context of LLM training optimization, robust empirical support, and the potential influence on future research, tempered by certain limitations in theoretical grounding and comprehensiveness in comparisons.

- **Abstract**: We present MILS: Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver, a surprisingly simple, training-free approach, to imbue multimodal capabilities into your favorite LLM. Leveraging their innate ability to perform multi-step reasoning, MILS prompts the LLM to generate candidate outputs, each of which are scored and fed back iteratively, eventually generating a solution to the task. This enables various applications that typically require training specialized models on task-specific data. In particular, we establish a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot image, video and audio captioning. MILS seamlessly applies to media generation as well, discovering prompt rewrites to improve text-to-image generation, and even edit prompts for style transfer! Finally, being a gradient-free optimization approach, MILS can invert multimodal embeddings into text, enabling applications like cross-modal arithmetic.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents MILS (Multimodal Iterative LLM Solver), a novel technique that enhances the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to handle multimodal tasks without requiring specialized training. By leveraging the innate multi-step reasoning abilities of LLMs, MILS iteratively prompts the model to produce candidate outputs, which are then scored and refined to generate optimal solutions. This methodology allows for significant advancements in zero-shot captioning for images, videos, and audio, while also improving text-to-image generation through smart prompt rewrites. Furthermore, MILS facilitates cross-modal tasks, enabling the inversion of multimodal embeddings into text, which opens up new possibilities for cross-modal arithmetic and creative media generation. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper introduces an interesting and innovative approach to integrating multimodal capabilities into existing LLMs without additional training, which is a significant step forward in the field of artificial intelligence. The idea of using iterative prompting and feedback showcases the potential for improving the performance of LLMs on multimodal tasks—traditionally a challenging area requiring extensive model training and task-specific datasets. Strengths: 1. **Novelty**: The concept of a training-free approach for enhancing LLM multimodality is remarkable and showcases a fresh perspective in a highly active research area. It challenges the norm of needing specialized training for similar tasks. 2. **Performance**: The authors claim a new state-of-the-art in several zero-shot tasks, indicating strong practical implications and potential for adoption in real-world applications. 3. **Versatility**: The ability of MILS to be applied across various media types (text, image, video, audio) indicates its broad applicability and relevance. Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the paper provides promising results, it does not thoroughly test MILS across diverse datasets or conditions, which raises questions about its robustness and reliability in more complex scenarios. 2. **Evaluation Metrics**: The paper could benefit from a more rigorous discussion of the evaluation metrics used to establish its state-of-the-art performance. A deeper analysis of the comparative results against existing methods would strengthen the validity of their claims. 3. **Dependency on LLMs**: The approach hinges heavily on the underlying capabilities of current LLMs, which may change with future developments in AI. This reliance could potentially limit the longevity of the approach's effectiveness as technology evolves. Overall, while the paper presents significant contributions and an innovative approach that challenges traditional training paradigms, it would benefit from a more rigorous examination of its capabilities and potential limitations.  **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper's clear contribution to methodological advancements in multimodal integration with LLMs while acknowledging areas where more robust validation is needed. The novelty of its training-free approach and its applicability in various tasks strongly positions it in the current research landscape, making it a noteworthy contribution, albeit with some caveats regarding generalizability and depth of evaluation.

### Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18099v1)
- **Authors**: Swarnadeep Saha, Xian Li, Marjan Ghazvininejad, Jason Weston, Tianlu Wang
- **Abstract**: LLM-as-a-Judge models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) sequences intended to capture the step-bystep reasoning process that underlies the final evaluation of a response. However, due to the lack of human annotated CoTs for evaluation, the required components and structure of effective reasoning traces remain understudied. Consequently, previous approaches often (1) constrain reasoning traces to hand-designed components, such as a list of criteria, reference answers, or verification questions and (2) structure them such that planning is intertwined with the reasoning for evaluation. In this work, we propose EvalPlanner, a preference optimization algorithm for Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge that first generates an unconstrained evaluation plan, followed by its execution, and then the final judgment. In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner iteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and executions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with a score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically generated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like RM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both planning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper, "Learning to Plan & Reason for Evaluation with Thinking-LLM-as-a-Judge," introduces EvalPlanner, a novel preference optimization algorithm aimed at enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in evaluating responses through a structured reasoning process. The authors identify shortcomings in existing models, which often rely on predefined reasoning components and integrate planning with evaluation reasoning. EvalPlanner distinctly separates the generation of an evaluation plan from its execution and final judgment. It employs a self-training loop that iteratively improves the evaluation plans and outputs based on synthetically created preference pairs. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the RewardBench and showcases its effectiveness across other benchmarks, underscoring the importance of planning and reasoning in evaluating model performances. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper must be considered through several lenses. First, the approach of disentangling evaluation planning from reasoning for judgment is a significant step forward. Previous models often mixed these processes without sufficient clarity or flexibility. By implementing a preference optimization algorithm, EvalPlanner brings a structured and iterative method to the evaluation process, which is commendable. Moreover, achieving state-of-the-art performance with less reliance on human-annotated data enriches the field of LLM evaluations, particularly as the community faces challenges with data scarcity. However, the reliance on synthetically generated data raises questions about the generalizability of the results. While the paper eloquently showcases improvements on various benchmarks, the underlying synthetic data creation process might not fully capture the nuances present in real-world evaluations, potentially limiting the applicability of the findings. In terms of its significance, the paper pushes forward the discussion on transparency and effectiveness in LLM evaluations. It introduces an innovative methodology that could influence future research directions on model judgment frameworks. However, the paper could have benefited from a more robust analysis of potential failures or biases introduced by the synthetic data approach, which would provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's limitations. In summary, the paper exhibits strong contributions in methodology with reasonable empirical validation. Yet, the concerns regarding the reliance on synthetic data and a relative lack of detailed analysis on its implications somewhat detracts from the overall impact. **Score: 7**

### Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18100v1)
- **Authors**: Yibo Wang, Tiansheng Huang, Li Shen, Huanjin Yao, Haotian Luo, Rui Liu, Naiqiang Tan, Jiaxing Huang, Dacheng Tao
- **Abstract**: Harmful fine-tuning attack introduces significant security risks to the fine-tuning services. Mainstream defenses aim to vaccinate the model such that the later harmful fine-tuning attack is less effective. However, our evaluation results show that such defenses are fragile -- with a few fine-tuning steps, the model still can learn the harmful knowledge. To this end, we do further experiment and find that an embarrassingly simple solution -- adding purely random perturbations to the fine-tuned model, can recover the model from harmful behavior, though it leads to a degradation in the model's fine-tuning performance. To address the degradation of fine-tuning performance, we further propose Panacea, which optimizes an adaptive perturbation that will be applied to the model after fine-tuning. Panacea maintains model's safety alignment performance without compromising downstream fine-tuning performance. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different harmful ratios, fine-tuning tasks and mainstream LLMs, where the average harmful scores are reduced by up-to 21.5%, while maintaining fine-tuning performance. As a by-product, we analyze the optimized perturbation and show that different layers in various LLMs have distinct safety coefficients. Source code available at https://github.com/w-yibo/Panacea
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "Panacea: Mitigating Harmful Fine-tuning for Large Language Models via Post-fine-tuning Perturbation" addresses the security risks associated with harmful fine-tuning attacks on large language models (LLMs). Traditional defenses focus on making the model resilient to such attacks, but results show these defenses can be undermined through further fine-tuning. The authors propose a new approach called Panacea, which involves applying adaptive random perturbations after the fine-tuning process. This method effectively reduces harmful behavior in models by up to 21.5% without significantly degrading their performance in downstream tasks. The authors also analyze how different layers and models respond to these perturbations, revealing varying safety coefficients across architectures. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty**: The approach presented in the paper distinguishes itself by introducing a straightforward yet effective solution to a complex problem—harmful fine-tuning attacks. While the idea of perturbing models is not entirely new, the specific implementation of adaptive perturbation post-fine-tuning is a unique contribution. Moreover, the authors provide empirical evidence across multiple tasks and LLM architectures, emphasizing the impact and necessity of their method. **Significance**: The findings have critical implications for the field of secure AI, particularly concerning the deployment of large language models in production. As these models become integral to various applications, ensuring their robustness against harmful manipulations will become increasingly important. The results could help shape future defense strategies, leading to safer models. **Strengths**: - The paper presents a clear problem statement backed by robust experimental data. - It offers a practical solution that strikes a balance between safety and performance. - The comprehensive analysis of perturbation effects across multiple contexts adds depth to the findings. **Weaknesses**: - The simplicity of the solution, while effective, raises questions about its generalizability across all possible scenarios of harmful fine-tuning. - The potential trade-offs between safety and other performance metrics could be elaborated further; the paper mentions degradation but does not explore the wider implications comprehensively. - There's limited discussion on the broader implications of the findings for the field or possible future directions spawned by their work. In summary, while the paper has notable contributions, its weaknesses in generalizability and depth of discussion regarding trade-offs slightly inhibit its impact. However, given the increasing importance of security in machine learning and the innovative nature of the proposed solution, the paper makes a substantial contribution to the field. **Score: 8**

### Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18107v1)
- **Authors**: Song Bian, Minghao Yan, Shivaram Venkataraman
- **Abstract**: Scaling laws are powerful tools to predict the performance of large language models. However, current scaling laws fall short of accounting for inference costs. In this work, we first show that model architecture affects inference latency, where models of the same size can have up to 3.5x difference in latency. To tackle this challenge, we modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to co-optimize the model parameter count, the number of training tokens, and the model architecture. Due to the reason that models of similar training loss exhibit gaps in downstream evaluation, we also propose a novel method to train inference-efficient models based on the revised scaling laws. We perform extensive empirical studies to fit and evaluate our inference-aware scaling laws. We vary model parameters from 80M to 1B, training tokens from 1.6B to 30B, and model shapes, training a total of 63 models. Guided by our inference-efficient scaling law and model selection method, we release the Morph-1B model, which improves inference latency by 1.8x while maintaining accuracy on downstream tasks compared to open-source models, pushing the Pareto frontier of accuracy-latency tradeoff.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Scaling Inference-Efficient Language Models" addresses the limitations of existing scaling laws in predicting the performance of large language models, specifically regarding inference latency. The authors demonstrate that models of the same size can exhibit significant differences in latency due to architectural choices. To address this issue, they propose an adaptation of the Chinchilla scaling laws to jointly optimize model parameters, training token counts, and architectural designs. They introduce a new method for training inference-efficient models based on these revised scaling laws, conducting extensive empirical studies that include 63 different models with varying parameters and training tokens. Their findings culminate in the release of the Morph-1B model, which achieves a 1.8x improvement in inference latency while preserving accuracy on downstream tasks, thus advancing the trade-off between accuracy and latency. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper contributes to the field by expanding the understanding of scaling laws for language models, particularly by integrating inference cost considerations into the optimization process. This is a notable advancement, as most previous studies primarily focus on model size and training data without adequately addressing inference latency. The introduction of an inference-efficient training methodology and the development of the Morph-1B model illustrate significant innovations. **Strengths:** 1. **Comprehensive Study:** The evaluation of 63 models provides a robust empirical foundation for the proposed scaling laws and model selection strategy. 2. **Practical Application:** The release of the Morph-1B model, showing tangible improvements in real-world scenarios (e.g., inference latency), reflects the practical applicability of the research. 3. **Theoretical Advancement:** The modification of the Chinchilla scaling laws represents a valuable theoretical contribution that can guide future research and model development. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope Limitations:** While the paper innovates within the scope of language models, its findings may have limitations when generalized to other types of neural networks or tasks, which could affect wide applicability. 2. **Evaluation Metrics:** Relying heavily on latency and accuracy may overlook other important dimensions of model performance, such as robustness, generalizability, or resource consumption during training. **Potential Influence:** The paper could significantly influence the design and optimization strategies for future language models, making them not only larger but also more efficient in terms of inference costs. This is particularly relevant in settings where response times are critical, such as real-time applications. **Score:** 8 **Justification:** The paper provides substantial contributions to the field with its formulation of inference-efficient scaling laws and an empirical demonstration through the Morph-1B model. While there are some limitations concerning the generalizability of the findings and evaluation metrics used, the advancements made in model architecture considerations for inference latency are both novel and impactful. Hence, an 8 is a fair reflection of its contribution—significant, but with some caveats that prevent it from reaching the highest score.

- **Authors**: Qika Lin, Tianzhe Zhao, Kai He, Zhen Peng, Fangzhi Xu, Ling Huang, Jingying Ma, Mengling Feng
- **Abstract**: Due to the presence of the natural gap between Knowledge Graph (KG) structures and the natural language, the effective integration of holistic structural information of KGs with Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a significant question. To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (\ie, tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes. Further, the fine-tuned LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 also have superior performance on KG link prediction and triple classification tasks, utilizing only 16 tokens per entity instead of thousands in conventional prompting methods.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a two-stage framework that aims to address the challenge of integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) due to the inherent differences between their structures. The proposed method, called Self-supervised Quantized Representation (SSQR), compresses both structural and semantic knowledge from KGs into discrete codes that resemble language tokens. The first stage involves learning these quantized representations, while the second focuses on utilizing them as features to be input directly into LLMs, facilitating a seamless integration. Experimental results reveal that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised methods, yielding more distinguishable codes. Additionally, fine-tuning of models like LLaMA2 and LLaMA3.1 using SSQR achieves better performance on knowledge graph-related tasks with a significantly reduced number of tokens. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a relevant and timely challenge in the integration of KGs with LLMs, an area critical for advancing AI's understanding and utilization of structured knowledge within natural language processing tasks. The novelty of the SSQR method lies in its approach to compressing KG information into a format compatible with language models, which is a necessary step given the growing interest in making LLMs more knowledgeable and context-aware.  **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The self-supervised quantization process adds value by merging discrete representations with language-oriented processing, which can facilitate better model comprehension of complex domains. 2. **Performance Gains**: The demonstrated improvements in link prediction and triple classification tasks indicate that the method has practical implications and can more efficiently handle KGs using minimal token representation. 3. **Practicality**: Reducing the number of tokens needed for effective performance is appealing in terms of efficiency and scalability, which are critical in real-world applications. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope**: While SSQR shows improvements over existing methods, the experiments primarily focus on link prediction and classification. Broader testing across various tasks and domains would strengthen the claims. 2. **Clarity of Contributions**: The framework could benefit from a more explicit delineation of how the proposed method differs from and improves upon previous techniques in terms of methodology and results. 3. **Potential Overfitting**: Without established benchmarks to assess generalization across different KGs, there is a risk that the proposed method might work well in specific tested scenarios but may not scale or adapt effectively in diverse applications. **Overall Assessment**: This research makes a noteworthy contribution to the field by addressing the integration of KGs and LLMs through a novel approach and demonstrating effective results in specific tasks. However, its impact may be somewhat limited by the specificity of its applications and the generalizability of findings. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Wanlong Liu, Yichen Xiao, Dingyi Zeng, Hongyang Zhao, Wenyu Chen, Malu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for deploying large language models (LLMs) within resource-limited settings by significantly reducing resource demands. However, existing PTQ strategies underperform at low bit levels < 3 bits due to the significant difference between the quantized and original weights. To enhance the quantization performance at low bit widths, we introduce a Mixed-precision Graph Neural PTQ (MG-PTQ) approach, employing a graph neural network (GNN) module to capture dependencies among weights and adaptively assign quantization bit-widths. Through the information propagation of the GNN module, our method more effectively captures dependencies among target weights, leading to a more accurate assessment of weight importance and optimized allocation of quantization strategies. Extensive experiments on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets demonstrate that our MG-PTQ method outperforms previous state-of-the-art PTQ method GPTQ, setting new benchmarks for quantization performance under low-bit conditions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Mixed-Precision Graph Neural Post-Training Quantization (MG-PTQ), a novel approach to improve Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) performance for deploying large language models (LLMs) with low bit-width representations. Traditional PTQ techniques struggle to maintain performance below 3 bits due to notable discrepancies between quantized and original weights. The authors leverage a graph neural network (GNN) to effectively understand weight dependencies and dynamically assign quantization bit widths.

The introduction of a mixed-precision strategy, supported by a GNN, reflects a thoughtful integration of machine learning techniques to address existing challenges in the quantization landscape, particularly at low bit widths.  **Strengths:** - **Novel Approach:** The use of GNNs to capture weight dependencies and optimize quantization allocation is a creative and effective strategy, showcasing a blend of deep learning methodologies. - **Performance Benchmark:** The empirical results demonstrating superior performance of MG-PTQ compared to existing PTQ methods provide a solid foundation for the claims made, indicating practical applicability of the proposed technique. - **Relevance:** Given the increasing demand for efficient models in AI applications, this work directly addresses a critical barrier in deploying LLMs, contributing to the ongoing discourse on efficient AI. **Weaknesses:** - **Limited Scope of Evaluation:** While the experiments on the WikiText2 and C4 datasets are insightful, broader evaluations including diverse model architectures and real-world scenarios could enhance the paper’s validity and applicability. - **Technical Complexity:** The introduction of GNNs may introduce complexities that could hinder adoption in some practical scenarios, necessitating a trade-off between performance improvements and deployment simplicity. - **Comparative Analysis:** While MG-PTQ outperforms GPTQ, it would be beneficial to include a wider comparison with other leading quantization methods to contextualize the performance gains. Despite these weaknesses, the contribution of this paper is evident and impactful. By addressing a significant limitation in PTQ processes for low-bit deployments of LLMs, it opens pathways for further research and practical applications in efficient model deployment. Based on the clear innovation, empirical validation, and relevance to a pressing issue in the field, I assign the paper a score of **8**.

- **Authors**: Yuchen Lei, Yuexin Xiang, Qin Wang, Rafael Dowsley, Tsz Hon Yuen, Jiangshan Yu
- **Abstract**: Cryptocurrencies are widely used, yet current methods for analyzing transactions heavily rely on opaque, black-box models. These lack interpretability and adaptability, failing to effectively capture behavioral patterns. Many researchers, including us, believe that Large Language Models (LLMs) could bridge this gap due to their robust reasoning abilities for complex tasks. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by applying LLMs to real-world cryptocurrency transaction graphs, specifically within the Bitcoin network. We introduce a three-tiered framework to assess LLM capabilities: foundational metrics, characteristic overview, and contextual interpretation. This includes a new, human-readable graph representation format, LLM4TG, and a connectivity-enhanced sampling algorithm, CETraS, which simplifies larger transaction graphs. Experimental results show that LLMs excel at foundational metrics and offer detailed characteristic overviews. Their effectiveness in contextual interpretation suggests they can provide useful explanations of transaction behaviors, even with limited labeled data.

- **Authors**: Jinyao Guo, Chengpeng Wang, Xiangzhe Xu, Zian Su, Xiangyu Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code auditing is a code review process with the goal of finding bugs. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial potential in this task, offering the ability to analyze programs without compilation and enabling customized bug detection following specified prompts. However, applying LLMs to repository-level code auditing presents notable challenges. The inherent context limits and hallucinations of LLMs can lead to the low quality of bug reports. Meanwhile, the large size of software repositories introduces substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability in real-world scenarios. This work introduces an autonomous LLM-agent, RepoAudit, designed to enable precise and efficient repository-level code auditing. Equipped with the agent memory, RepoAudit explores the code repository on demand, analyzing data-flow facts along different feasible program paths in individual functions. It also introduces the validator to check the data-flow facts for hallucination mitigation and examine the satisfiability of path conditions of potential buggy paths, which enables RepoAudit to discard false positives in the code auditing. Our experiment shows that RepoAudit powered by Claude 3.5 Sonnet successfully finds 38 true bugs in 15 real-world systems, consuming 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project on average.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "RepoAudit: An Autonomous LLM-Agent for Repository-Level Code Auditing" presents an innovative tool named RepoAudit, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of code auditing across software repositories. RepoAudit addresses key challenges associated with repository-level auditing, such as the limitations in context and hallucinations that LLMs experience, which can compromise the quality of bug reports. The system employs agent memory to navigate code repositories dynamically and analyze data-flow facts across different program execution paths. An important feature is a validator that checks for hallucination errors and evaluates the feasibility of paths likely to contain bugs, allowing it to filter out false positives effectively. Experiments demonstrated RepoAudit's capability to identify 38 genuine bugs in 15 real-world systems, with minimal resource expenditure (0.44 hours and $2.54 per project). --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** RepoAudit presents a significant advancement by integrating memory and validation mechanisms to address common pitfalls in LLM-driven code audits, notably hallucinations and context limitations. The application of these concepts at the repository level, rather than individual code segments, showcases originality in the approach, as most existing tools focus on smaller code bases or lack efficacy in managing larger repositories. **Significance:** The potential impact of RepoAudit could be considerable, particularly for teams working with large codebases who face challenges due to resources and time constraints in code auditing. The quantifiable results (38 true bugs found in a relatively short time) underscore its practical applicability and effectiveness, suggesting it could serve as a valuable asset in software development practices. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The design incorporates memory and external validation mechanisms, which are not commonly utilized in existing LLM-based auditing tools. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors empirically establish the effectiveness of RepoAudit with results from real-world applications, lending credibility to their claims. 3. **Cost and Time Efficiency:** The results demonstrate a notable reduction in time and cost typically associated with code auditing, which could encourage wider adoption. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** The experiments are limited to 15 real-world systems, which raises questions about the generalizability of the findings across diverse programming environments or languages. 2. **Dependence on LLMs:** The reliance on Claude 3.5 Sonnet raises concerns regarding the scalability; any advancements in LLMs may necessitate adjustments or upgrades in RepoAudit, which may complicate future enhancements. 3. **Lack of Comprehensive Error Analysis:** Although the paper mentions hallucination mitigation, a deeper exploration of different types of errors and false positives could strengthen the understanding of RepoAudit's limitations. **Conclusion:**  RepoAudit is a notable contribution to the field of code auditing, particularly at the repository level, by intelligently utilizing advances in LLMs combined with overcoming existing limitations. Despite its initial success, the potential for limitations with scaling, generalizability, and dependency on specific models must be considered. Overall, this work progresses the intersection of machine learning and software engineering, but further exploration and validation across different contexts are necessary. **Score: 8**

### Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18177v1)
- **Authors**: Teddy Lazebnik, Labib Shami
- **Abstract**: Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a persistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications. Many socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing factors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the tax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as observed in the real world, neglecting the "big bang" of such activity in a population. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in computer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial intelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy appearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel computational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the emergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation powered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework is uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge organically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling agents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for exploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The experimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases, demonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic behaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external narratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public goods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal economic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision and robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is sufficient to curtail informal activity effectively.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "Investigating Tax Evasion Emergence Using Dual Large Language Model and Deep Reinforcement Learning Powered Agent-based Simulation" addresses the issue of tax evasion, a major facet of informal economies, through a novel computational framework. Unlike traditional studies that treat tax evasion behavior as a given, this research aims to understand how such behaviors can emerge organically within a population. The framework leverages an agent-based simulation that integrates Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, allowing for a nuanced exploration of socio-economic determinants influencing compliance behavior. Key elements of the study include: - The experimental design involved both model validation and exploratory phases, validating the framework's ability to replicate theoretical economic behaviors. - Findings reveal that personality traits, societal narratives, enforcement probabilities, and perceptions of public goods’ efficiency significantly affect the emergence of informal economic activity. - The study concludes that effective public goods provision and strong enforcement mechanisms are necessary yet insufficient on their own to prevent informal economic activities. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**   This paper presents a significant advancement in the study of tax evasion by utilizing cutting-edge AI methodologies and a computational approach that allows for the investigation of emergent behaviors rather than pre-defined ones. The integration of Large Language Models facilitates the modeling of complex narratives and social influences, while Deep Reinforcement Learning enhances agent decision-making processes, making the simulation more dynamic and realistic. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology**: The combination of AI techniques with agent-based modeling is a relatively new approach in the field, potentially setting a precedent for future research. 2. **Realistic Simulation**: By allowing informal economic behaviors to emerge rather than being prescribed, the framework provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of tax evasion. 3. **Robust Findings**: The identification of various socio-economic factors that influence tax evasion offers practical implications for policy-making. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Model Complexity**: While the integration of AI enhances the model, it may also lead to increased complexity that complicates interpretation and validation of results. 2. **Generalizability**: The findings, while insightful, may depend heavily on specific parameters and settings chosen in the simulations, potentially limiting their applicability across different contexts or cultures. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper would benefit from empirical validation incorporating real-world data to support the theoretical model outcomes and strengthen its conclusions. **Score: 8**   This score reflects the paper’s strong contribution to the field through its innovative approach and solid findings that could inform both academic discourse and practical policy. However, there are concerns regarding the intricacy of the models and validation procedures that slightly temper the overall impact, hence the score stops short of the highest marks.

### In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18187v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyuan Sun, Ali Jadbabaie, Navid Azizan
- **Abstract**: Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable ability in in-context learning (ICL), where they can adapt to unseen tasks from a prompt with a few examples, without requiring parameter updates. Recent research has provided insight into how linear Transformers can perform ICL by implementing gradient descent estimators. In particular, it has been shown that the optimal linear self-attention (LSA) mechanism can implement one step of gradient descent with respect to a linear least-squares objective when trained on random linear regression tasks. However, the theoretical understanding of ICL for nonlinear function classes remains limited. In this work, we address this gap by first showing that LSA is inherently restricted to solving linear least-squares objectives and thus, the solutions in prior works cannot readily extend to nonlinear ICL tasks. To overcome this limitation, drawing inspiration from modern architectures, we study a mechanism that combines LSA with GLU-like feed-forward layers and show that this allows the model to perform one step of gradient descent on a polynomial kernel regression. Further, we characterize the scaling behavior of the resulting Transformer model, highlighting the necessary model size to effectively handle quadratic ICL tasks. Our findings highlight the distinct roles of attention and feed-forward layers in nonlinear ICL and identify key challenges when extending ICL to nonlinear function classes.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "In-Context Learning of Polynomial Kernel Regression in Transformers with GLU Layers" explores the limits of in-context learning (ICL) in transformer architectures, specifically addressing the performance of linear self-attention (LSA) on nonlinear tasks. The authors highlight that existing ICL frameworks primarily cater to linear least-squares tasks, thus presenting a gap in their applicability to nonlinear function classes. To address this issue, they propose an innovative mechanism that integrates LSA with Gated Linear Units (GLU) to enable efficient one-step gradient descent for polynomial kernel regression tasks. The study further investigates the scaling requirements for transformers dealing with quadratic ICL tasks and elucidates the unique roles of attention and feed-forward layers in managing the challenges posed by nonlinear tasks. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper makes a significant contribution by tackling a previously under-explored area of ICL within transformer models—nonlinear tasks. By demonstrating the limitations of LSA on nonlinear objectives and proposing a new architecture that integrates GLU layers, the authors present an original approach that diverges from existing methodologies primarily focused on linear tasks. This pivot towards nonlinear function approximation is both innovative and relevant for advancing transformer capabilities in diverse applications. **Significance:** The work holds substantial relevance in the broader context of improving ICL for practical scenarios, where many tasks are inherently nonlinear. By establishing an understanding of how transformer architectures can successfully adapt to these challenges, the findings can pave the way for further research and development of more robust models that can tackle a wider range of problems without necessitating parameter updates. The discussion of scaling behaviors also adds practical insight into model design considerations for future research endeavors. **Strengths:**  1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The paper effectively bridges the theoretical gap regarding nonlinear ICL, advancing our understanding of transformer limitations and capabilities. 2. **Empirical and Practical Relevance:** By focusing on polynomial kernel regression, the authors present a relevant application that could be beneficial for numerous real-world tasks. 3. **Clear Framework:** The integration of GLU layers is a well-articulated approach that adds value to the transformer architecture, enhancing its flexibility and performance profile. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope:** While the exploration of polynomial kernel regression is valuable, it may limit the applicability of the results across broader nonlinear classes that may not fit the polynomial paradigm. 2. **Generalization Concerns:** The empirical validation of the proposed method over a diverse set of nonlinear tasks remains unaddressed, which could challenge the robustness of the conclusions drawn. Considering the innovative methodological approach, the theoretical advancements in understanding nonlinear ICL, and the practical implications for future applications, I assign the paper a score of 8.  **Score: 8**

### Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v1)
- **Authors**: James Blades, Frederick Somerfield, William Langley, Susan Everingham, Maurice Witherington
- **Abstract**: Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel encoding mechanism for token representation within large language models (LLMs), addressing limitations in conventional self-attention mechanisms that often fail to accurately preserve long-range hierarchical structures in text generation. The authors propose a dependency-aware token encoding strategy that embeds relational constraints into token representations from the outset rather than relying solely on attention dynamics. By employing dependency-weighted attention computations, their approach retains essential syntactic and semantic dependencies across layers, enhancing the coherence and consistency of autoregressive text generation. Empirical results indicate reduced perplexity on various linguistic tasks, suggesting improved contextual coherence, while also noting a moderate increase in memory usage and training time due to added matrix computations. The structured encoding results in better lexical variation and dependency retention, particularly benefiting longer sequences which traditional models struggle with. Overall, the findings advocate for a method that bolsters phrase generation structure without needing extra syntactic data or auxiliary objectives. **Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies in its approach to integrate structured relationships within token interactions at the representation level, rather than relying on learned dependencies through self-attention. This approach represents a significant shift in how LLMs can be constructed, potentially improving their performance in language tasks that require an understanding of complex dependencies. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Innovative Concept:** The introduction of dependency-aware token encoding is a fresh perspective within the landscape of token representation in LLMs. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The authors provide empirical evidence supporting their claims, showing improved perplexity and dependency alignment on various benchmarks. 3. **Practical Applications:** Since the method doesn’t require external annotations or auxiliary tasks, it is directly applicable in real-world scenarios, enhancing usability. However, there are weaknesses: 1. **Limited Exploration of Trade-offs:** While the paper mentions a moderate increase in resource consumption, it does not explore in-depth how this may affect the applicability of the approach in resource-constrained settings. 2. **Specificity of Improvements:** The focus on dependency retention may not generalize across all datasets and tasks; thus, further exploration across diverse linguistic stimuli could be beneficial. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** Although scalability is claimed to be feasible, the initial increase in computational demands could hinder widespread adoption without optimization. The overall potential influence of the work is considerable as it shifts paradigms in LLM representation approaches, but the applicability and efficiency of implementing such modifications need more exploration. Given the strengths in proposing a clear improvement concept in token representation, counterbalanced by concerns regarding implementation and generalizability, I assign this paper a score that reflects its contributions but also its limitations.

- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Li, Chunlong Sun, Xiangcheng Zheng
- **Abstract**: This work investigates both direct and inverse problems of the variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which attracts increasing attentions in both practical applications and theoretical aspects. Based on the perturbation method, which transfers the original model to an equivalent but more tractable form, the analytical extensibility of the solutions and the weak unique continuation principle are proved, which results in the uniqueness of the inverse space-dependent source problem from local internal observation. Then, based on the variational identity connecting the inversion input data with the unknown source function, we propose a weak norm and prove the conditional stability for the inverse problem in this norm. The iterative thresholding algorithm and Nesterov iteration scheme are employed to numerically reconstruct the smooth and non-smooth sources, respectively. Numerical experiments are performed to investigate their effectiveness.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores both the direct and inverse problems associated with a variable-exponent sub-diffusion model, which has gained attention in various practical and theoretical contexts. By applying a perturbation method, the authors successfully reformulate the original problem into a more manageable form. They demonstrate the analytical extensibility of the solutions and establish a weak unique continuation principle, leading to the conclusion that the inverse space-dependent source problem can be uniquely determined from local measurements. The authors develop a weak norm based on variational identities that provides conditional stability for the inverse problem. They utilize iterative algorithms, specifically an iterative thresholding algorithm and a Nesterov iteration scheme, to numerically reconstruct both smooth and non-smooth sources. Numerical experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of these methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies in addressing the specific challenge of variable-exponent sub-diffusion, a model that allows for a varied diffusion rate across different spatial domains, which is particularly relevant for applications in complex media. The use of a perturbation method to achieve analytical results and establish unique continuation principles adds depth to the existing literature on inverse problems in diffusion processes. The introduction of a weak norm tied to variational methods and the validation of stability results under such a framework are commendable contributions that could inspire further research. However, certain aspects merit critique. While the theoretical developments are robust, the paper could benefit from a more in-depth discussion on the implications of the conditional stability results, particularly how they compare with previous results in the literature. The numerical methods applied, though promising, could be augmented by a wider range of numerical experiments to test the methods' applicability across varying conditions and noise levels. Furthermore, the paper lacks an extensive review of the existing body of work on inverse problems, which would have provided context for the significance of the findings. Despite these critiques, the paper addresses a relevant and modern challenge in mathematical modeling, potentially influencing future theoretical developments and applications in fields like biology, materials science, and environmental engineering. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Rapid progress in text-to-motion generation has been largely driven by diffusion models. However, existing methods focus solely on temporal modeling, thereby overlooking frequency-domain analysis. We identify two key phases in motion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained improving stage**. To address these phases effectively, we propose **Fre**quency **e**nhanced **t**ext-**to**-**m**otion diffusion model (**Free-T2M**), incorporating stage-specific consistency losses that enhance the robustness of static features and improve fine-grained accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on StableMoFusion, our method reduces the FID from **0.189** to **0.051**, establishing a new SOTA performance within the diffusion architecture. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating frequency-domain insights into text-to-motion generation for more precise and robust results.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Free-T2M: Frequency Enhanced Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model With Consistency Loss" addresses a significant gap in the existing text-to-motion generation methods by introducing the Free-T2M model, which incorporates frequency-domain analysis alongside the traditional temporal modeling. It outlines the motion denoising process in two stages: **semantic planning** and **fine-grained improving**. The authors emphasized adding stage-specific consistency losses to enhance feature robustness while achieving finer accuracy in motion generation. Their experimental results reveal substantial improvements in performance on the StableMoFusion dataset, demonstrated by a decrease in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) from 0.189 to 0.051, marking a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the diffusion model framework.  **Rigorously Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper is notable as it successfully integrates frequency analysis into the text-to-motion generation framework, which is a relatively unexplored area in contrast to the temporal modeling that dominates existing approaches. By doing so, it identifies and formalizes distinct phases in motion denoising and proposes concrete strategies for enhancing each phase, which could serve as a foundation for future research in this domain. Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of frequency-domain insights adds a new dimension to text-to-motion models, potentially leading to more nuanced and effective motion generation processes. 2. **Robust Methodology:** The authors provide a clear framework and experimental validation, showcasing significantly improved performance metrics over previous models. 3. **Potential for Real-World Applications:** Enhanced precision in motion generation could have far-reaching implications in animation, gaming, and virtual reality applications. Weaknesses: 1. **Specificity of Results:** While the results are impressive, the paper could provide a broader contextualization of how these improvements translate to practical applications, particularly in diverse settings. 2. **Limited Scope of Analysis:** The focus on only two stages may overlook other relevant factors impacting the generated motion sequences. Further exploration of additional phases or variables could enhance the robustness of the model. 3. **Generalizability of Findings:** Application across various datasets beyond StableMoFusion would help to assess the model's robustness and generalizability better. Considering the novelty and significance of the contribution, alongside the well-articulated findings and potential applications, I would assign this paper a score of **8**. This score reflects a strong impact on the field while recognizing the need for broader validation and exploration beyond the initial findings.  **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18237v1)
- **Authors**: Malte Tölle, Mohamad Scharaf, Samantha Fischer, Christoph Reich, Silav Zeid, Christoph Dieterich, Benjamin Meder, Norbert Frey, Philipp Wild, Sandy Engelhardt
- **Abstract**: A patient undergoes multiple examinations in each hospital stay, where each provides different facets of the health status. These assessments include temporal data with varying sampling rates, discrete single-point measurements, therapeutic interventions such as medication administration, and images. While physicians are able to process and integrate diverse modalities intuitively, neural networks need specific modeling for each modality complicating the training procedure. We demonstrate that this complexity can be significantly reduced by visualizing all information as images along with unstructured text and subsequently training a conventional vision-text transformer. Our approach, Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM), not only simplifies data preprocessing and modeling but also outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping, as evaluated on 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The modalities include patient's clinical measurements, medications, X-ray images, and electrocardiography scans. We hope our work inspires advancements in multi-modal medical AI by reducing the training complexity to (visual) prompt engineering, thus lowering entry barriers and enabling no-code solutions for training. The source code will be made publicly available.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel approach to integrate diverse patient data modalities, including temporal measurements, administrative data, and images, using a framework called Vision Transformer for irregular sampled Multi-modal Measurements (ViTiMM). It addresses the challenge faced by neural networks in processing multi-modal data by converting all data into a visual format, alongside unstructured text, thereby allowing a vision-text transformer to be employed. The study demonstrates that this method significantly simplifies data preprocessing and training complexity while achieving superior performance in predicting in-hospital mortality and phenotyping compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, based on an analysis of 6,175 patients from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The authors aim to inspire advancements in multi-modal medical AI through their approach, which enables reduced entry barriers for practitioners and promotes no-code solutions. The source code is promised to be made publicly available. ### Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The notion of converting multi-modal patient data into a unified image format for processing is relatively novel. While there have been various attempts to tackle multi-modal data, the specific application of Vision Transformers, a technique primarily used in computer vision, to health data represents a significant adaptation. 2. **Impact on Complexity**: The reduction of training complexity by leveraging prompt engineering aims to democratize access to AI implementations in healthcare, potentially attracting a broader group of developers and researchers. This could foster further innovation and applications in the medical domain. 3. **Performance Metrics**: The reported performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in critical tasks, such as predicting in-hospital mortality, provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This indicates practical implications for clinical practice and decision-making, thereby enhancing the relevance of the work. 4. **Public Availability**: The commitment to providing public access to the source code enhances the replicability of the study, which is crucial for fostering trust and further research in the application of AI in healthcare. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Generality of Conclusions**: While the approach is evaluated on a substantial dataset, the specific focus on the MIMIC-IV dataset may limit the generalizability of the findings across different healthcare contexts or datasets. The effectiveness of the model may vary significantly with different data characteristics. 2. **Context and Comprehensibility**: The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of how the transformation of various modalities to a common visual format preserves the inherent information and relationships critical for clinical relevance. 3. **Technical Limitations**: While the vision-text transformer is effective, there could be concerns regarding how it handles temporal dynamics and irregular intervals explicitly, as these are critical in medical settings. If the methodology implicitly assumes uniformity in modality representation, important information might be lost. **Overall Impact**: The implications for simplifying multi-modal data handling in medical AI, combined with promising performance metrics, suggest that the work could significantly influence future research and applications. Yet, the necessity for further studies to validate results across diverse datasets remains essential. **Final score: Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong novel contribution with practical implications and the potential for significant impact on the informatics landscape of healthcare, tempered by a need for broader validation and clearer articulation of the methodology's generalizability.

### MAMS: Model-Agnostic Module Selection Framework for Video Captioning
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18269v1)
- **Authors**: Sangho Lee, Il Yong Chun, Hogun Park
- **Abstract**: Multi-modal transformers are rapidly gaining attention in video captioning tasks. Existing multi-modal video captioning methods typically extract a fixed number of frames, which raises critical challenges. When a limited number of frames are extracted, important frames with essential information for caption generation may be missed. Conversely, extracting an excessive number of frames includes consecutive frames, potentially causing redundancy in visual tokens extracted from consecutive video frames. To extract an appropriate number of frames for each video, this paper proposes the first model-agnostic module selection framework in video captioning that has two main functions: (1) selecting a caption generation module with an appropriate size based on visual tokens extracted from video frames, and (2) constructing subsets of visual tokens for the selected caption generation module. Furthermore, we propose a new adaptive attention masking scheme that enhances attention on important visual tokens. Our experiments on three different benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the performance of three recent video captioning models.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents MAMS, a model-agnostic framework designed to enhance video captioning by improving how visual tokens (or frames) are selected and utilized. Current methods often struggle with the trade-off between capturing enough frames for significant information and avoiding redundancy from consecutive frames. MAMS addresses this issue with two key innovations: (1) it selects a caption generation module proportional to the number of important visual tokens and (2) it constructs subsets of these visual tokens tailored for the chosen module. An adaptive attention masking technique is also introduced to prioritize crucial visual information during the captioning process. The effectiveness of MAMS is validated through experiments on three benchmark datasets, showing notable performance improvements compared to existing video captioning models. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Significance**:  1. **Innovation in Methodology**: MAMS introduces a novel approach to module selection and token construction in video captioning, addressing a critical gap in handling visual data. While others have made strides in attention mechanisms and frame selection, MAMS's model-agnostic design and adaptive attention masking provide meaningful advancements. 2. **Impact on Current Research**: The paper builds on existing multi-modal transformer models and pushes the boundaries by suggesting a versatile framework that can be applied across multiple architectures. This could influence the future of video captioning systems and promote further research into modular approaches and adaptive mechanisms. 3. **Practical Applications**: The improvements shown in the experiments indicate that MAMS could lead to better user experiences in applications requiring video understanding, such as automated content creation, accessibility features, and enhanced search functionalities. **Strengths**: - The framework directly addresses a common limitation in the field related to frame selection, thus improving potential outcomes for caption generation. - The inclusion of an adaptive mechanism for attention allocation reflects a sophisticated understanding of the problem space, which could set a precedent for future work. **Weaknesses**: - While the concept is compelling, the paper may benefit from a more extensive exploration of the limitations of the proposed method, such as how it performs with different types of videos (e.g., those with less formal structure or varying illumination). - The results, though showing improvements, should ideally be contextualized with a more thorough comparison against a wider range of existing methods, including those that might utilize different types of architectures or attention mechanisms. ### Score Considering the new contributions, practical applicability, and the methodology’s potential for future research, I would assign a score of **8**. This score reflects the paper’s strong foundation and clear advancements in addressing specific challenges within the video captioning domain, while also acknowledging the necessity for a broader evaluation of its limitations and comparative performance.  **Score: 8**

### Jailbreaking LLMs' Safeguard with Universal Magic Words for Text Embedding Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18280v1)
- **Authors**: Haoyu Liang, Youran Sun, Yunfeng Cai, Jun Zhu, Bo Zhang
- **Abstract**: The security issue of large language models (LLMs) has gained significant attention recently, with various defense mechanisms developed to prevent harmful outputs, among which safeguards based on text embedding models serve as a fundamental defense. Through testing, we discover that the distribution of text embedding model outputs is significantly biased with a large mean. Inspired by this observation, we propose novel efficient methods to search for universal magic words that can attack text embedding models. The universal magic words as suffixes can move the embedding of any text towards the bias direction, therefore manipulate the similarity of any text pair and mislead safeguards. By appending magic words to user prompts and requiring LLMs to end answers with magic words, attackers can jailbreak the safeguard. To eradicate this security risk, we also propose defense mechanisms against such attacks, which can correct the biased distribution of text embeddings in a train-free manner.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper addresses the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) regarding their safeguard mechanisms, particularly focusing on those reliant on text embedding models. The authors identify a significant bias in the output distributions of these models, which can be exploited using "universal magic words." These magic words, when appended to user prompts, manipulate the similarity scores and thus circumvent the protective measures. In response to this potential exploitation, the authors propose new defense strategies that aim to correct the biased outputs in a train-free method. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** The paper introduces a novel concept of "universal magic words" that target the biases of text embedding models, showcasing a substantial understanding of how these safeguards can be undermined. This approach contributes to the ongoing discourse about LLM security and highlights a previously overlooked vulnerability in existing safeguard designs. **Strengths:** 1. **Identification of Bias:** The recognition of biased output distributions in text embedding models is a critical insight, providing a tangible metric for evaluating model security. 2. **Innovative Attack Methodology:** The creation of a method that exploits this bias with universal magic words is a creative and potentially impactful strategy. 3. **Proposed Defenses:** The development of defenses against these types of attacks enriches the paper's contribution, showing a holistic approach to model security. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Empirical Validation:** While the theoretical underpinnings are sound, the paper's claims about the effectiveness of the proposed methods could be bolstered by more extensive empirical testing and case studies. 2. **Generalizability of Findings:** The specific targeting of text embedding models may limit the broader applicability of results to other types of LLM safeguards. 3. **Ethical Implications:** The paper could improve its discussion on the ethical considerations of developing such attack methods, particularly regarding potential malicious uses. Overall, while the paper introduces a novel attack vector and defensive strategies, the less robust empirical basis and potential ethical ramifications temper its impact somewhat. Given the innovative approach to vulnerability exploitation and the existence of proposed defenses, but taking into account the aforementioned weaknesses, I would assign the paper a moderate to high score. **Score: 7**

Specifically, we focus on extracting species names, their locations, associated habitats, and ecosystems, information that is critical for understanding species spread, predicting future invasions, and informing conservation efforts. Traditional text mining approaches often struggle with the complexity of ecological terminology and the subtle linguistic patterns found in these texts. By applying general-purpose LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning, we uncover both the promise and limitations of using these models for ecological entity extraction. In doing so, this study lays the groundwork for more advanced, automated knowledge extraction tools that can aid researchers and practitioners in understanding and managing biological invasions.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) to extract significant ecological information from literature on invasion biology. It seeks to identify species names, locations, habitats, and ecosystems, which are essential for tracking species dispersal and guiding conservation strategies. Traditional text mining techniques struggle with the intricacies of ecological language; hence, this research evaluates the effectiveness of general LLMs in handling such complexities without domain-specific tuning. The findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in ecology, paving the way for future automated tools that could enhance our understanding and management of biological invasions. **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** Strengths: 1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper applies cutting-edge technology (LLMs) in an emerging field (invasion biology), presenting a modern method for a long-standing problem. 2. **Practical Relevance**: By focusing on the extraction of essential ecological entities, the study addresses real-world challenges associated with biological invasions and conservation efforts, thus contributing toward significant ecological sustainability. 3. **Foundation for Future Work**: The exploratory nature of the study suggests a path forward for more refined tools in knowledge extraction, indicating good foresight into developing automated solutions. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Fine-Tuning**: The decision to use general-purpose LLMs without domain-specific fine-tuning may restrict the accuracy and depth of the findings. This choice might lead to less reliable results when dealing with nuanced ecological data. 2. **Lack of Concrete Results**: The paper may present findings that are largely preliminary, which could hinder immediate applicability and impact within the field. The effectiveness of these LLMs could be further measured against traditional methods to highlight any advancements or deficiencies. 3. **Generalizability**: While the results regarding LLM performance are valuable, they may not extend across diverse ecological contexts or other areas of biodiversity research, limiting broader applicability. Overall, while the paper presents a noteworthy application of modern technology to ecological data extraction, its reliance on general-purpose models without necessary adaptations may undermine the overall effectiveness of the approach. Consequently, it offers foundational ideas but largely remains exploratory with limited immediate impact. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a good balance of novelty and relevance to the field, acknowledging the potential for future advancements while recognizing the limitations of the current study. The application forms a solid groundwork for further research, suggesting that while the innovation is commendable, the immediate impact could be enhanced through more targeted strategies.

### Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18320v1)
- **Authors**: Tianpeng Pan, Wenqiang Pu, Licheng Zhao, Rui Zhou
- **Abstract**: Automated optimization modeling (AOM) has evoked considerable interest with the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering, utilizing meticulously designed expert response chains or structured guidance. However, prompt-based techniques have failed to perform well in the sensor array signal processing (SASP) area due the lack of specific domain knowledge. To address this issue, we propose an automated modeling approach based on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique, which consists of two principal components: a multi-agent (MA) structure and a graph-based RAG (Graph-RAG) process. The MA structure is tailored for the architectural AOM process, with each agent being designed based on principles of human modeling procedure. The Graph-RAG process serves to match user query with specific SASP modeling knowledge, thereby enhancing the modeling result. Results on ten classical signal processing problems demonstrate that the proposed approach (termed as MAG-RAG) outperforms several AOM benchmarks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Leveraging LLM Agents for Automated Optimization Modeling for SASP Problems: A Graph-RAG based Approach" discusses a novel method for Automated Optimization Modeling (AOM) specific to sensor array signal processing (SASP) issues. The authors highlight the limitations of current prompt engineering techniques which inadequately address the complexities of SASP due to insufficient domain knowledge. To overcome this limitation, the researchers introduce a dual-component approach known as MAG-RAG. The first component is a multi-agent (MA) structure that mimics human modeling processes. The second component is a graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (Graph-RAG) process that links user queries to pertinent SASP modeling knowledge. The proposed method is tested on ten classical signal processing problems, demonstrating superior performance over existing AOM benchmarks. **Rigorous and Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a timely exploration in the steadily evolving domain of optimization modeling, particularly with the integration of large language models which have garnered considerable attention in recent years. The novelty primarily lies in the application of a multi-agent framework combined with a graph-based retrieval mechanism, tailored specifically for SASP problems, which are often complex and data-heavy. This targeted approach seems to bridge a gap in current methodologies that largely rely on general prompt engineering without domain-specific adaptations. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Methodology:** The introduction of the MA structure draws inspiration from human cognitive processes, which could enhance the way models are generated. 2. **Specific Application:** By focusing on SASP, the authors contribute directly to an under-researched area where prompt engineering has fallen short. 3. **Empirical Evidence:** The validation of their approach across ten distinct signal processing problems provides strong support for its practical applicability and effectiveness. 4. **Clear Problem Statement:** The paper clearly identifies and addresses a significant limitation in existing methodologies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Scope of Testing:** While the results are promising, the paper does not indicate the diversity of the tested problems beyond mentioning ten classical ones. This raises questions about generalizability. 2. **Limited Comparison Metrics:** The benchmarks for comparison could be elaborated upon to fully contextualize the improvements made by MAG-RAG. A deeper comparative analysis with more existing AOM techniques might have strengthened their claim. 3. **Lack of Theoretical Foundation:** The theoretical underpinning of the MA structure and its relationship to human cognitive processes is minimally explored, missing an opportunity to ground their model in robust cognitive science. Overall, the paper seems to offer a valuable and innovative contribution to the fields of optimization modeling and signal processing. Its application of LLMs in a structured, domain-specific context potentially opens new avenues for research in automated modeling. Given these factors, I would assign the paper a score of **7**. While it demonstrates novelty and significant implications within its specific niche, it does possess some weaknesses regarding generalization and theoretical elaboration. Nonetheless, the proposed approach may drive further exploration and development in the field of automated modeling.  **Score: 7**

### A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18322v1)
- **Authors**: Valérie Castin, Pierre Ablin, José Antonio Carrillo, Gabriel Peyré
- **Abstract**: Transformers, which are state-of-the-art in most machine learning tasks, represent the data as sequences of vectors called tokens. This representation is then exploited by the attention function, which learns dependencies between tokens and is key to the success of Transformers. However, the iterative application of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to be fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence with a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called Transformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure. Our first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We show the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an interacting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis to several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention, Sinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a conditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the first to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on Gaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the Transformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to analyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical behaviors. This Gaussian analysis captures the evolution of data anisotropy through a deep Transformer. In particular, we highlight a clustering phenomenon that parallels previous results in the non-normalized discrete case.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "A Unified Perspective on the Dynamics of Deep Transformers" seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics that underlie the operation of Transformer models in machine learning. The authors frame the analysis through a probabilistic lens by modeling the input sequences as probability measures, resulting in a Vlasov equation termed the Transformer PDE. They investigate two primary settings: one with compactly supported initial data where they prove well-posedness of the Transformer PDE and extend prior analysis to various types of attention mechanisms (e.g., multi-head and Sigmoid attention). The second focus is on non-compactly supported initial conditions, specifically Gaussian measures, showing the PDE's ability to maintain the Gaussian measure space and uncovering significant behaviors such as data anisotropy evolution and clustering phenomena typical of deep Transformers. **Evaluation:** In evaluating the novelty and significance of this research, several points emerge: **Strengths:** 1. **Theoretical Contributions:** The introduction of the Transformer PDE provides a framework to understand the dynamics of attention in Transformers, which is an essential aspect of their functioning. This novel perspective offers avenues for future research, particularly in rigorous mathematical analyses of self-attention mechanisms. 2. **Generality and Extension:** By covering various types of self-attention and including results for both compact and non-compact initial conditions, the paper makes a strong case for the versatility and robustness of its findings across different model architectures. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The examination of Gaussian initialization and the identification of the clustering phenomenon add empirical credibility to their theoretical claims, making the paper relevant both theoretically and practically. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity of Concepts:** The mathematical framework might present a steep learning curve for practitioners or researchers who are not well-versed in measure theory or PDEs, potentially limiting its immediate applicability to other researchers in the field. 2. **Depth of Empirical Analysis:** While the paper alludes to numerical simulations of results, the extent and detail of empirical analysis supporting its claims could have been elaborated upon. The finding is intriguing but demands robust empirical backing to help demonstrate its real-world implications. 3. **Risk of Over-generalization:** By attempting to create a unified framework, there is a risk of oversimplifying the inherently complex behaviors of different attention mechanisms or missing nuances that could lead to a better understanding of their specific dynamics. **Conclusion:** The paper contributes a significant theoretical advance in understanding Transformer dynamics through the introduction of the Transformer PDE. It tackles both compact and non-compact cases, extending existing literature and providing strong avenues for future exploration. However, the complexity involved and potentially insufficient empirical analysis may impede its broader outreach. Overall, considering these factors, the significance of the contribution is notable but not without its limitations. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Yiteng Tu, Weihang Su, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu, Qingyao Ai
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge retrieved from a knowledge base. However, its effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the reliability of both the retriever and the knowledge base. In real-world scenarios, imperfections in these components often lead to the retrieval of noisy, irrelevant, or misleading counterfactual information, ultimately undermining the trustworthiness of RAG systems. To address this challenge, we propose Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT), a method designed to enhance the resilience of LLMs against retrieval defects through two targeted fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RbFT significantly improves the robustness of RAG systems across diverse retrieval conditions, surpassing existing methods while maintaining high inference efficiency and compatibility with other robustness techniques.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces Robust Fine-Tuning (RbFT), a method aimed at improving the resilience of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, which combine large language models with external knowledge sources. It addresses the primary challenges posed by unreliable retrieval systems and defective knowledge bases, which can lead to the integration of inaccurate or irrelevant information. RbFT incorporates two specific fine-tuning tasks that aim to mitigate the effects of these retrieval defects. Experimental results indicate that RbFT enhances the robustness of RAG systems significantly when compared to previous approaches, while preserving high efficiency and compatibility with existing robustness strategies. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the field of natural language processing, especially in enhancing the effectiveness of RAG systems. This is increasingly important as these systems scale in application and complexity. The novelty lies in the introduction of a structured fine-tuning process specifically aimed at counteracting the downsides of retrieval impurities.  Strengths: 1. Relevance: The problem tackled is timely and significant, given the growing reliance on RAG systems in practical applications. 2. Methodology: The proposed RbFT technique is detailed and appears to methodologically address specific retrieval issues, suggesting a thoughtful approach to enhancing model robustness. 3. Experimental Validation: The results demonstrate a clear improvement over existing techniques, validating the proposed approach effectively. Weaknesses: 1. Generalizability: While improvements are shown, it remains to be seen how RbFT performs across various datasets and different domains that may introduce unique retrieval challenges. 2. Comparative Analysis: The paper could benefit from a deeper comparative analysis with not just past methods, but emerging alternatives in the field, to contextualize its advantages. 3. External Validation: Discussion on how RbFT might interact with various retrieval architectures or knowledge databases could enhance the understanding of its applicability. In summary, RbFT is a meaningful contribution that seems to improve the robustness of retrieval-augmented generation, addressing a critical need in the field. The paper builds on existing ideas while introducing something conceptually new, though the extent of its influence over time will depend on further validation in diverse environments and comprehensive comparative studies. **Score: 8**

### Function Encoders: A Principled Approach to Transfer Learning in Hilbert Spaces
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18373v1)
- **Authors**: Tyler Ingebrand, Adam J. Thorpe, Ufuk Topcu
- **Abstract**: A central challenge in transfer learning is designing algorithms that can quickly adapt and generalize to new tasks without retraining. Yet, the conditions of when and how algorithms can effectively transfer to new tasks is poorly characterized. We introduce a geometric characterization of transfer in Hilbert spaces and define three types of inductive transfer: interpolation within the convex hull, extrapolation to the linear span, and extrapolation outside the span. We propose a method grounded in the theory of function encoders to achieve all three types of transfer. Specifically, we introduce a novel training scheme for function encoders using least-squares optimization, prove a universal approximation theorem for function encoders, and provide a comprehensive comparison with existing approaches such as transformers and meta-learning on four diverse benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the function encoder outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark tasks and on all three types of transfer.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "Function Encoders: A Principled Approach to Transfer Learning in Hilbert Spaces" addresses a significant challenge in transfer learning: enabling algorithms to adapt to new tasks efficiently without the need for retraining. The authors present a geometric framework that categorizes transfer in Hilbert spaces into three distinct types—interpolation within the convex hull, extrapolation to the linear span, and extrapolation beyond the span. They propose a novel approach utilizing function encoders supported by least-squares optimization to facilitate these transfers. A universal approximation theorem is established for function encoders, and the proposed method is compared to existing techniques like transformers and meta-learning across four distinct benchmarks. The findings suggest that function encoders achieve superior performance across all transfer scenarios and tasks evaluated. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents an intriguing approach to transfer learning grounded in a geometrical perspective on function encoders, which appears to be a novel addition to the field. The author’s ability to define and categorize transfer types offers a structured way to think about transfer learning problems, which is valuable for researchers looking to understand the nuances of task generalization. Strengths: 1. **Novel Framework:** The geometric characterization of transfer in Hilbert spaces is original and deepens the theoretical understanding of transfer learning. 2. **Comprehensive Comparison:** The empirical evaluation against well-known methods, such as transformers and meta-learning, strengthens the claims of performance superiority. 3. **Universal Approximation Theorem:** Establishing a universal approximation theorem for function encoders is a significant theoretical contribution. 4. **Diverse Benchmarks:** Testing across four different benchmarks demonstrates the method's robustness and generalizability. Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope of Benchmarks:** While the four benchmarks showcase performance, they might not encompass the full variability of real-world tasks, which could limit the generalizability of the findings. 2. **Complexity of the Method:** The training scheme using least-squares optimization, while theoretically sound, could introduce practical challenges regarding implementation and efficiency in real-world applications. 3. **Lack of Interpretability:** Like many advanced machine learning models, function encoders may possess interpretability issues, which is increasingly a concern within the research community. Overall, the paper provides a meaningful contribution to the field by proposing a new method for transfer learning and setting a theoretical foundation for future research in this area. While it does have some limitations, the strengths of novel theory, empirical performance, and structured analysis suggest that this work will influence ongoing research in transfer learning, potentially guiding future explorations into the geometry of learning tasks. **Score: 8**

### MatIR: A Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Image Restoration Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18401v1)
- **Authors**: Juan Wen, Weiyan Hou, Luc Van Gool, Radu Timofte
- **Abstract**: In recent years, Transformers-based models have made significant progress in the field of image restoration by leveraging their inherent ability to capture complex contextual features. Recently, Mamba models have made a splash in the field of computer vision due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and their significant computational efficiency compared to Transformers. However, Mamba currently lags behind Transformers in contextual learning capabilities. To overcome the limitations of these two models, we propose a Mamba-Transformer hybrid image restoration model called MatIR. Specifically, MatIR cross-cycles the blocks of the Transformer layer and the Mamba layer to extract features, thereby taking full advantage of the advantages of the two architectures. In the Mamba module, we introduce the Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module, which traverses along four scan paths to achieve efficient processing of long sequence data. In the Transformer module, we combine triangular window-based local attention with channel-based global attention to effectively activate the attention mechanism over a wider range of image pixels. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper presents MatIR, a hybrid model that integrates Mamba and Transformer architectures to enhance image restoration tasks. Mamba models are noted for their computational efficiency and ability to manage long-range dependencies, while Transformer models excel at contextual feature extraction. MatIR aims to leverage the strengths of both models by implementing a cross-cycling mechanism between the two architectures. It introduces an Image Inpainting State Space (IRSS) module within the Mamba layer for efficient processing and enhances the Transformer layer with triangular window-based local attention combined with channel-based global attention, thus improving the attention mechanism across image pixels. Experiments and ablation studies validate the model's effectiveness in image restoration. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Significance:** Strengths: 1. **Innovative Hybrid Approach**: The integration of Mamba and Transformer models is a novel contribution that seeks to maximize the strengths of both architectures, addressing specific limitations such as contextual learning and computational efficiency. 2. **Effective Mechanisms**: The introduction of the IRSS module for efficient data processing along multiple scan paths marks a significant advancement in how long sequence data can be handled, suggesting practical improvements in image restoration tasks. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The extensive experimental results and ablation studies strengthen the validity of the claims made in the paper, demonstrating that the hybrid approach indeed yields better performance compared to using either model independently. Weaknesses: 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the performance of MatIR is well-illustrated, there may be a lack of deeper comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art hybrid models that also aim to combine the benefits of different architectures. 2. **Scalability Concerns**: The paper does not address how well the model scales with varying sizes of image data, which is a critical aspect of practical deployment in real-world scenarios where images can vary significantly in resolution and complexity. 3. **Generality of Findings**: The findings may be limited to specific types of image restoration tasks without evidence that this approach generalizes well across the broader spectrum of image processing challenges. Overall, while MatIR shows promise and incorporates innovative elements, its full impact on the field will depend on its robustness across different datasets and tasks. The combination approach is interesting, but it would require more exploration and comparison with existing models to truly ascertain its place in the landscape of image restoration. **Score: 7**  This score reflects the paper's innovative approach, effective use of architectures, and thorough evaluation, balanced against the need for further comparative and scalability analyses. While it presents a solid contribution, it likely does not redefine the field entirely and leaves room for improvement in broader applicability and depth of comparisons.

- **Authors**: Youngjoon Lee, Taehyun Park, Yunho Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang
- **Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly being adopted in military collaborations to develop Large Language Models (LLMs) while preserving data sovereignty. However, prompt injection attacks-malicious manipulations of input prompts-pose new threats that may undermine operational security, disrupt decision-making, and erode trust among allies. This perspective paper highlights four potential vulnerabilities in federated military LLMs: secret data leakage, free-rider exploitation, system disruption, and misinformation spread. To address these potential risks, we propose a human-AI collaborative framework that introduces both technical and policy countermeasures. On the technical side, our framework uses red/blue team wargaming and quality assurance to detect and mitigate adversarial behaviors of shared LLM weights. On the policy side, it promotes joint AI-human policy development and verification of security protocols. Our findings will guide future research and emphasize proactive strategies for emerging military contexts.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper investigates the vulnerabilities presented by prompt injection attacks within the context of Federated Learning (FL) for military-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs). It highlights four significant vulnerabilities: the risk of secret data leakage, exploitation by free-riders, disruption of systems, and the potential for misinformation propagation. To counter these threats, the authors propose a collaborative framework that integrates both technical measures—like red/blue team wargaming for adversarial behavior detection—and policy initiatives focused on the development and verification of joint AI-human security protocols. The paper aims to guide future research and underline proactive strategies related to military applications of LLMs. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a timely and relevant issue at the convergence of artificial intelligence, military operations, and data security. The exploration of prompt injection attacks within federated military LLMs is a notable addition to the existing literature, which has primarily focused on concerns like data privacy and model accuracy without sufficiently addressing adversarial inputs. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The topic directly addresses emerging security concerns in military AI applications, making it timely and significant. 2. **Comprehensive Approach:** The dual focus on both technical and policy aspects of risk mitigation provides a holistic view of the challenges and potential solutions. 3. **Proactive Strategy:** Highlighting the need for proactive measures contributes positively to how military organizations could adapt to the evolving threat landscape. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Novelty:** While the focus on prompt injection in the military context is relatively novel, the concept of adversarial attacks is not entirely new. The novelty may be limited when considering existing research on adversarial machine learning. 2. **Lack of Empirical Evidence:** The framework proposed is conceptual, and the paper would benefit from empirical studies or case analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of the recommended strategies. 3. **Potential Overreliance on Collaboration:** The suggestion for a collaborative framework might imply a reliance on human operators who may not always be equipped with sufficient expertise or situational awareness, potentially slowing down response times in critical scenarios. Given these considerations, the paper does present valuable insights and holds significance for ongoing discourse regarding military applications of AI. However, it doesn't fully break new ground in the wider field of adversarial machine learning or military AI due to its conceptual nature and lack of concrete evidence supporting its claims. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: This paper presents SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer for efficient scaling in text-to-image generation. Building upon SANA-1.0, we introduce three key innovations: (1) Efficient Training Scaling: A depth-growth paradigm that enables scaling from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with significantly reduced computational resources, combined with a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. (2) Model Depth Pruning: A block importance analysis technique for efficient model compression to arbitrary sizes with minimal quality loss. (3) Inference-time Scaling: A repeated sampling strategy that trades computation for model capacity, enabling smaller models to match larger model quality at inference time. Through these strategies, SANA-1.5 achieves a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on GenEval, which can be further improved to 0.80 through inference scaling, establishing a new SoTA on GenEval benchmark. These innovations enable efficient model scaling across different compute budgets while maintaining high quality, making high-quality image generation more accessible.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces SANA-1.5, a linear Diffusion Transformer aimed at improving efficiency in text-to-image generation. It builds on the previous version, SANA-1.0, and presents three major innovations:  1. **Efficient Training Scaling**: A depth-growth approach allowing scalability from 1.6B to 4.8B parameters with reduced computational demands and using a memory-efficient 8-bit optimizer. 2. **Model Depth Pruning**: A technique that analyzes block importance to enable model compression to arbitrary sizes while maintaining quality. 3. **Inference-time Scaling**: A sampling strategy that allows smaller models to reach the quality of larger models, enhancing efficiency in inference processes. These innovations result in achieving a text-image alignment score of 0.72 on the GenEval benchmark, with potential improvement to 0.80 through inference scaling, thus setting a new state-of-the-art (SoTA) in this domain. The paper argues that these advancements make high-quality image generation more accessible across diverse computational resources. --- **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents notable advancements in the field, particularly in addressing the scalability and efficiency concerns associated with large language models applied to image generation tasks.  **Strengths:** 1. **Scalability Innovations**: The depth-growth paradigm and the memory-efficient optimizer are significant contributions, aiming to reduce the computational burden while accommodating increased model sizes. This is particularly timely given the growing demand for larger neural networks and the constraints of available computational resources. 2. **Model Compression**: The model depth pruning technique is advantageous as it can potentially democratize access to high-quality generative models by allowing deployment on less powerful hardware without substantial quality trade-offs. 3. **Inference Efficiency**: Introducing a repeated sampling strategy redefines how inference can be optimized, allowing practical applications of models typically restricted to high-end setups. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Competitiveness of Results**: While the reported scores on GenEval are commendable, the paper does not sufficiently compare against recent state-of-the-art results in detail, which could provide better context regarding the significance of the improvements. 2. **Limited Novelty of Techniques**: Some methods, such as model pruning and efficient inference via sampling, are not entirely novel and have been previously explored in literature. This may diminish the novelty of their application in this specific context. **Overall Impact**:  As the paper proposes techniques that could significantly enhance the accessibility and efficiency of large models, it is likely to inspire further research in this area. Its contributions may accelerate the adoption of such systems in practical applications. However, to fully establish its standing, further benchmarking against recent advancements in text-to-image generation could be beneficial. **Score: 8**  This reflects a strong contribution to the field, with innovative methodologies that address critical issues of scalability and efficiency, despite some limitations in the novelty of certain techniques and a need for more comprehensive comparison with existing works.

- **Authors**: Huaiyuan Ying, Hongyi Yuan, Jinsen Lu, Zitian Qu, Yang Zhao, Zhengyun Zhao, Isaac Kohane, Tianxi Cai, Sheng Yu
- **Abstract**: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold immense potential for advancing healthcare, offering rich, longitudinal data that combines structured information with valuable insights from unstructured clinical notes. However, the unstructured nature of clinical text poses significant challenges for secondary applications. Traditional methods for structuring EHR free-text data, such as rule-based systems and multi-stage pipelines, are often limited by their time-consuming configurations and inability to adapt across clinical notes from diverse healthcare settings. Few systems provide a comprehensive attribute extraction for terminologies. While giant large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA 405B excel at structuring tasks, they are slow, costly, and impractical for large-scale use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GENIE, a Generative Note Information Extraction system that leverages LLMs to streamline the structuring of unstructured clinical text into usable data with standardized format. GENIE processes entire paragraphs in a single pass, extracting entities, assertion statuses, locations, modifiers, values, and purposes with high accuracy. Its unified, end-to-end approach simplifies workflows, reduces errors, and eliminates the need for extensive manual intervention. Using a robust data preparation pipeline and fine-tuned small scale LLMs, GENIE achieves competitive performance across multiple information extraction tasks, outperforming traditional tools like cTAKES and MetaMap and can handle extra attributes to be extracted. GENIE strongly enhances real-world applicability and scalability in healthcare systems. By open-sourcing the model and test data, we aim to encourage collaboration and drive further advancements in EHR structurization.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces GENIE, a Generative Note Information Extraction model designed to address the challenges of structuring unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHRs). While existing methods have limitations, such as being cumbersome and inflexible, GENIE utilizes fine-tuned smaller large language models (LLMs) to efficiently process clinical notes. It extracts various attributes—including entities, assertion statuses, and modifiers—accurately and in a single pass. This approach not only enhances workflow efficiency but also improves scalability across diverse healthcare environments. By outshining traditional tools like cTAKES and MetaMap, GENIE offers a significant leap in information extraction capabilities. The authors also commit to open-sourcing the model and test data to promote collaboration and innovation in this domain. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper demonstrates substantial novelty by proposing a new model (GENIE) that effectively combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with a specialized focus on EHR data extraction. Its strengths include its potential to streamline workflows and reduce manual configuration efforts, which have been persistent challenges in the field. The model’s ability to extract multiple attributes in a single pass represents an advancement over traditional methods, which often require multiline pipelines and extensive pre- and post-processing. However, one area of concern is the reliance on smaller LLMs despite the existence of larger, more powerful models available in the field. While the authors argue that GENIE’s efficiency justifies the use of these smaller models, the paper does not sufficiently address comparative performance metrics between small LLMs and more substantial models when scaled up for large datasets. Additionally, while the authors mention improved accuracy over existing systems, they could strengthen their argument with more comprehensive quantitative evaluations, particularly in diverse clinical settings. Moreover, the implications of this work could be hindered if the model lacks adaptability to various healthcare systems that employ highly customized clinical notes. Therefore, further validation across different clinical scenarios would enhance the robustness of their findings. In conclusion, while GENIE represents an important step forward in EHR data structuring, it may be perceived as an incremental improvement rather than a revolutionary one due to its partial reliance on existing technologies and methodologies. **Score: 7**  This score reflects both the innovative aspects of the proposed methodology and its practical implications for healthcare data management, balanced against potential limitations regarding model scalability and comprehensive evaluation across diverse clinical notes.

### CALM: Unleashing the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning Ability of Language Model Question Answering
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18457v1)
- **Authors**: Yumeng Wang, Zhiyuan Fan, Qingyun Wang, May Fung, Heng Ji
- **Abstract**: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pretrained on extensive multilingual corpora to acquire both language-specific cultural knowledge and general knowledge. Ideally, while LLMs should provide consistent responses to culture-independent questions across languages, we observe significant performance disparities. To address this, we explore the Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models (CALM) to align knowledge across languages. Specifically, for a given question, we sample multiple responses across different languages, and select the most self-consistent response as the target, leaving the remaining responses as negative examples. We then employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to align the model's knowledge across different languages. Evaluations on the MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets demonstrate CALM's effectiveness in enhancing cross-lingual knowledge question answering, both in zero-shot and retrieval augmented settings. We also found that increasing the number of languages involved in CALM training leads to even higher accuracy and consistency. We offer a qualitative analysis of how cross-lingual consistency can enhance knowledge alignment and explore the method's generalizability. The source code and data of this paper are available on GitHub.
- **Summary**: **Summary**:   The paper introduces CALM (Cross-Lingual Self-Aligning ability of Language Models), which aims to reconcile the performance disparities noted in large language models (LLMs) when answering culture-independent questions across multiple languages. It proposes a method where multiple model responses to a single question are sampled in various languages. From these responses, the most consistent answer is selected while others are treated as negative examples. The authors employ direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve knowledge alignment across languages. Testing on MEDQA and X-CSQA datasets shows that CALM significantly enhances cross-lingual question answering performance, particularly emphasizing that incorporating more languages into the training process yields better accuracy and consistency. The paper also discusses the implications of cross-lingual consistency on knowledge alignment and the generalizability of the method. The associated code and data are made publicly available on GitHub. **Evaluation**:   In terms of novelty, the idea of leveraging self-consistency across languages to enhance the capabilities of LLMs is relatively innovative. It identifies a tangible gap in how LLMs manage cultural contexts and aligns them effectively, which is critical for improving cross-lingual tasks. By using DPO for this alignment, the authors present a new angle in optimizing language models, suggesting a practical application that could potentially improve various multilingual applications. Strengths include: 1. **Clear Motivation**: The introduction of performance disparities among LLMs showcases the need for cross-lingual consistency, making a compelling case. 2. **Robust Experimental Framework**: The evaluation across different datasets demonstrates CALM’s effectiveness in both zero-shot and retrieval-augmented settings, reinforcing the proposed methodology. 3. **Scalability**: The finding that incorporating more languages increases performance suggests a scalable approach that could benefit future research. On the downside: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the method is effective, the paper does not explore potential limitations or pitfalls of aligning responses; for example, how it handles culturally nuanced questions that may have no suitable consensus across languages. 2. **Generality Concerns**: The paper's claims regarding generalizability could be further substantiated with broader testing across more diverse datasets or tasks. In conclusion, CALM contributes significantly to the understanding of language model alignment and cross-lingual capabilities, and its findings could influence future research into multilingual NLP tasks. However, the paper could improve its impact by addressing the limitations of its approach and providing more robustness in its claims regarding generalizability and practical applications.  **Score: 8**

### ExeCoder: Empowering Large Language Models with Executability Representation for Code Translation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18460v1)
- **Authors**: Minghua He, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Wenjie Yin, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang
- **Abstract**: Code translation is a crucial activity in the software development and maintenance process, and researchers have recently begun to focus on using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for code translation. However, existing LLMs only learn the contextual semantics of code during pre-training, neglecting executability information closely related to the execution state of the code, which results in unguaranteed code executability and unreliable automated code translation. To address this issue, we propose ExeCoder, an LLM specifically designed for code translation, aimed at utilizing executability representations such as functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in code translation. To evaluate the effectiveness of ExeCoder, we manually enhanced the widely used benchmark TransCoder-test, resulting in a benchmark called TransCoder-test-X that serves LLMs. Evaluation of TransCoder-test-X indicates that ExeCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in code translation, surpassing existing open-source code LLMs by over 10.88% to 38.78% and over 27.44% to 42.97% on two metrics, and even outperforms the renowned closed-source LLM GPT-4o. Website: https://execoder4trans.github.io/
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper:  **Title:** ExeCoder: Empowering Large Language Models with Executability Representation for Code Translation The paper presents ExeCoder, a novel large language model (LLM) specifically geared towards improving automated code translation by incorporating executability representations. Traditional LLMs, while adept at understanding the contextual semantics of code, often overlook executability aspects, which can lead to unreliable code translation results. ExeCoder aims to bridge this gap by leveraging representations such as functional semantics, syntax structures, and variable dependencies. To assess its performance, the authors enhanced the existing benchmark TransCoder-test into TransCoder-test-X, demonstrating that ExeCoder significantly outperforms both open-source code LLMs and the well-known closed-source model GPT-4o by notable margins on various metrics.  ### Critical Evaluation: #### Novelty: ExeCoder introduces a significant enhancement to the state of the art in code translation by specifically addressing the lack of executability information in pre-trained models. While the application of LLMs in code translation is not new, the focus on executability representations is a vital and somewhat underexplored area. By foregrounding how functional semantics and variable dependencies can be integrated into LLM architectures, this paper presents a distinct conceptual leap, which is valuable. #### Significance: The influence of ExeCoder extends beyond mere performance improvements; it potentially shifts the paradigm of how LLMs can be applied in practical programming contexts, making automated code generation and translation more reliable. The results suggest that incorporating executability can lead to significant advancements in both the accuracy and efficiency of code translation tools, which is critical in software development and maintenance. #### Strengths: - The introduction of a new benchmark (TransCoder-test-X) adds to the field, allowing for more rigorous evaluation of code translation models. - The reported performance improvements (10.88% to 42.97% over existing models) indicate a substantial advancement. - The framework of executability representation is conceptually sound and could inspire further research into integrating execution state in other applications of LLMs. #### Weaknesses: - The paper may not fully address the scalability of ExeCoder; how well it performs on less structured or more diverse code might need further exploration. - It remains to be seen how extensible the proposed method is across different programming languages or coding paradigms. - While comparisons with models like GPT-4o are informative, more detailed analysis of the trade-offs related to model size and training requirements could enhance understanding of practical implications. #### Overall Assessment: ExeCoder represents a meaningful advance in the application of LLMs for code translation by addressing a crucial oversight in traditional model designs. Its introduction of executability representation shows promise for enhancing the reliability of automated coding tools and could influence future research directions significantly.  Given the balance of its strengths and potential limitations, I assign a score of **8/10**. This reflects strong novelty and significant contributions while recognizing that further exploration of scalability and practical applicability remains necessary. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18475v1)
- **Authors**: Yanxia Deng, Aozhong Zhang, Naigang Wang, Selcuk Gurses, Zi Yang, Penghang Yin
- **Abstract**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a highly efficient approach for downstream tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources. However, applying LoRA techniques to quantized LLMs poses unique challenges due to the reduced representational precision of quantized weights. In this paper, we introduce CLoQ (Calibrated LoRA initialization for Quantized LLMs), a simplistic initialization strategy designed to overcome these challenges. Our approach focuses on minimizing the layer-wise discrepancy between the original LLM and its quantized counterpart with LoRA components during initialization. By leveraging a small calibration dataset, CLoQ quantizes a pre-trained LLM and determines the optimal LoRA components for each layer, ensuring a strong foundation for subsequent fine-tuning. A key contribution of this work is a novel theoretical result that enables the accurate and closed-form construction of these optimal LoRA components. We validate the efficacy of CLoQ across multiple tasks such as language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms existing LoRA fine-tuning methods for quantized LLMs, especially at ultra low-bit widths.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CLoQ, a novel initialization strategy for fine-tuning quantized large language models (LLMs) using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Fine-tuning with LoRA is advantageous for limited computational resources; however, the quantization of LLMs presents representational challenges that CLoQ addresses. CLoQ minimizes discrepancies between original and quantized LLMs during initialization by using a small calibration dataset to optimize LoRA components layer-wise. The authors present a theoretical framework for constructing these components accurately and validate their approach across various tasks—including language generation, arithmetic reasoning, and commonsense reasoning—demonstrating that CLoQ outperforms existing methods, particularly at ultra low-bit quantization. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of CLoQ lies in its tailored approach to initializing LoRA components for quantized models, which is essential given the unique challenges posed by quantization, such as reduced representational ability. The theoretical advancement presented in the accurate, closed-form construction of LoRA components enriches the existing literature and provides a clear pathway for practitioners working with quantized models. The experimental validation across varied tasks further strengthens the relevance and application of the proposed method. However, some weaknesses can be identified. The paper presents a specific scenario (ultra low-bit widths) which may limit the generalizability of the findings to broader contexts of LLM usage, particularly in scenarios where high-precision models are preferred. Additionally, while the results show improved performance, further comparative studies with other emerging techniques or combinations of techniques would provide deeper insights into the approach’s adaptability and integration into existing frameworks. In terms of significance, the work offers considerable potential to optimize fine-tuning practices for quantized LLMs, particularly in light of the rising need for efficiency in deploying large models in resource-constrained environments. CLoQ could pave the way for future research focusing on hybrid methods that leverage quantization alongside efficient fine-tuning. Overall, this paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field, addressing practical challenges with innovative solutions and theoretical backing.  Score: 8

### A Tool for In-depth Analysis of Code Execution Reasoning of Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18482v1)
- **Authors**: Changshu Liu, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand
- **Abstract**: Code Executing Reasoning is becoming a new non-functional metric that assesses the ability of large language models (LLMs) in programming tasks. State-of-the-art frameworks (CodeMind or REval) and benchmarks (CruxEval) usually focus on LLM's prediction of a given code's input/output or intermediate variable states/values on limited programs. However, there is no tool for more in-depth analysis of the results. Without such a tool, the observations about LLM's code execution reasoning cannot be generalized to more datasets, preventing the research community and practitioners from devising the next generation of LLMs with better code execution reasoning abilities. This paper introduces ExeRScope, a series of tools and heuristics to analyze the result of code execution reasoning frameworks to understand better the impact of code properties in the studied benchmarks on the code execution reasoning. With such tooling, analysis can be generalized to code with similar properties without the urgent need to design more benchmarks, which is a cumbersome effort.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces ExeRScope, a novel tool designed for in-depth analysis of large language models (LLMs) in programming tasks, specifically focusing on their code execution reasoning abilities. Existing frameworks like CodeMind and REval primarily evaluate LLMs based on their ability to predict input/output relationships or variable states for limited programming tasks. However, these methods lack the capacity for broader analysis, which hampers the generalization of findings across different datasets and restricts advancements in LLMs with enhanced code execution reasoning. ExeRScope addresses this gap by providing a systematic approach for analyzing and interpreting how code properties influence LLM performance. This tool aims to facilitate generalization of insights across various code scenarios without the necessity of creating additional benchmarks, thus streamlining the research process. **Evaluation:** The paper presents a significant advancement in the evaluation of LLMs in programming contexts, which is an increasingly relevant area of research as AI continues to integrate into software development. The introduction of ExeRScope is both timely and necessary, given the limitations of current frameworks in providing comprehensive insights into code execution reasoning. The ability to generalize findings across similar sets of code can lead to more robust future developments in LLMs, enhancing their practical utility and effectiveness. **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The tool offers a fresh perspective on addressing existing gaps in the assessment of code execution reasoning, moving beyond simplistic input/output evaluations. 2. **Utility**: By facilitating analysis across various code properties without developing new benchmarks, ExeRScope promises to save time and resources in LLM research. 3. **Relevance**: The topic is highly relevant as LLMs are increasingly being employed in programming and software development tasks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Methodological Clarity**: The paper could benefit from clearer elaboration on the specific tools and heuristics included in ExeRScope, as well as their implementation. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: A more robust comparative analysis between ExeRScope and existing methodologies would strengthen the paper’s claims regarding its superiority and effectiveness. Overall, while the paper presents a novel and useful tool, there is room for improvement in clarity and competitive exposition. However, its potential impact on the field, particularly in guiding the development of LLMs with better reasoning capabilities, warrants a positive assessment. **Score: 8**

### Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch

- **Abstract**: Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a large number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and parameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient step, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth communication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits. Recently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location constraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where synchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means that workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links without affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication across workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the synchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In this paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets of parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak bandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, which decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by workers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining these modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of billion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing required bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Streaming DiLoCo with overlapping communication: Towards a Distributed Free Lunch" discusses advancements in the training of large language models (LLMs) using a distributed framework that mitigates the need for co-located accelerators and high-bandwidth communication. The authors present an enhanced version of the existing DiLoCo algorithm by implementing three key modifications:  1. They synchronize only subsets of model parameters sequentially instead of all parameters at once, significantly reducing the peak bandwidth requirement during training. 2. They allow workers to continue training while synchronizing, leading to improved wall clock time efficiency. 3. They use quantization to minimize the data exchanged between workers, further cutting down on bandwidth needs. Through experimental validation, the authors demonstrate that these modifications enable the distributed training of billion-parameter models while maintaining a comparable learning quality to previous methods, achieving a bandwidth reduction by two orders of magnitude. **Evaluation:** This paper presents notable innovations in the field of distributed training of LLMs, targeting the critical issues associated with bandwidth and communication efficiency. The proposed modifications to the original DiLoCo framework—especially the ability to synchronize only subsets of parameters and continue training during synchronization—offer practical enhancements that could be highly beneficial in real-world scenarios where communication constraints are a significant bottleneck. **Strengths:** - The paper addresses a fundamental limitation in distributed systems by allowing for more flexible communication strategies. - The empirical results indicating substantial bandwidth reduction while preserving model performance suggest that the proposed methods could lead to widespread applicability across various settings. - The innovative approach of partially synchronizing parameters and overlapping communication while training is a significant step forward. **Weaknesses:** - While the methods are theoretically and empirically promising, the paper may require further validation on diverse datasets and training scenarios to prove robustness. - The impact of quantization on model performance could be explored more thoroughly to ensure it does not lead to any unintended degradation in quality. - Potential implications on the complexity and implementation overhead of the new scheme are not discussed and could pose barriers to adoption in practice. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper represents a solid advancement in the field of distributed learning and addresses critical concerns about bandwidth efficiency. While there are areas for further investigation and validation, the innovative approaches taken present enough merit to have a substantial influence on the field moving forward. **Score: 8**

### Learn from the Past: Language-conditioned Object Rearrangement with Large Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18516v1)
- **Authors**: Guanqun Cao, Ryan Mckenna, John Oyekan
- **Abstract**: Object rearrangement is a significant task for collaborative robots, where they are directed to manipulate objects into a specified goal state. Determining the placement of objects is a major challenge that influences the efficiency of the rearrangement process. Most current methods heavily rely on pre-collected datasets to train the model for predicting the goal position and are restricted to specific instructions, which limits their broader applicability and effectiveness.In this paper, we propose a framework of language-conditioned object rearrangement based on the Large Language Model (LLM). Particularly, our approach mimics human reasoning by using past successful experiences as a reference to infer the desired goal position. Based on LLM's strong natural language comprehension and inference ability, our method can generalise to handle various everyday objects and free-form language instructions in a zero-shot manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods can effectively execute the robotic rearrangement tasks, even those involving long sequential orders.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel framework for language-conditioned object rearrangement using Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the limitations of existing methods that rely heavily on pre-collected datasets for training and struggle with specific instructions. The proposed approach utilizes past successful experiences as references to infer target object placements, effectively mimicking human reasoning. Leveraging the strong natural language comprehension abilities of LLMs, the method allows for the generalization to various object types and free-form language instructions without prior training on specific datasets. Experimental results highlight the efficiency of this framework in executing tasks involving complex and lengthy sequential orders. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The paper demonstrates notable novelty primarily through its unique integration of LLMs into the object rearrangement task.

- **Authors**: Anmol Goel, Yaxi Hu, Iryna Gurevych, Amartya Sanyal
- **Abstract**: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the \textit{\underline{P}rivate \underline{S}teering for LLM \underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa, Qwen, Mistral and Gemma). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation editing and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated probabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our \textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Differentially Private Steering for Large Language Model Alignment" addresses the critical issue of aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values while preventing the leakage of private information from datasets used for training. The authors introduce a novel algorithm called Private Steering for LLM Alignment (PSA), which employs differential privacy (DP) techniques during activation editing—a method that modifies LLM representations based on private demonstrations to steer the models toward desirable outcomes. Through extensive experimentation on various LLMs and benchmarks, the proposed PSA algorithm is shown to maintain performance metrics related to alignment and text generation quality while offering robustness against potential privacy threats. Additionally, the authors introduce a new Membership Inference Attack (MIA) specifically designed for this context to assess the effectiveness of their privacy guarantees. **Critical Evaluation:** In terms of **novelty**, the paper introduces a significant advancement in the intersection of privacy and AI alignment, which is a burgeoning area of research. The introduction of the PSA algorithm and its integration of differential privacy into the activation editing process offers a fresh perspective on addressing privacy concerns that arise when using private datasets for model training. The exploration of membership inference attacks tailored for activation editing also adds a unique angle, as it opens new avenues for evaluating privacy guarantees in LLMs. **Significance** is evident in that aligning LLMs with human values while safeguarding privacy is an urgent need in AI ethics. The stakes are high due to the potential for models to unintentionally expose sensitive information, making the authors' contributions highly relevant and timely. However, the paper could have been strengthened by a more comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between privacy and performance. While the authors claim minimal performance loss, detailed comparisons with existing methods should have been more rigorously framed to solidify the argument. Furthermore, the method's applicability across diverse datasets and real-world scenarios remains somewhat speculative, and more empirical validation in varied contexts would enhance the study's robustness. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Integration:** Combines differential privacy with LLM alignment, addressing a critical intersection between privacy and ethical AI use. 2. **Empirical Validation:** Comprehensive experiments across multiple models lend credibility to the proposed method. 3. **New Evaluation Metric:** The introduction of a tailored Membership Inference Attack for activation editing contributes to the field's understanding of LLM privacy. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Trade-off Analysis:** More rigorous discussions on privacy-versus-performance trade-offs would provide greater insight into practical implications. 2. **Scope of Experiments:** Future work could benefit from broader datasets and evaluation metrics for wider applicability. Given the paper's contributions to an important and timely topic, its novel method of ensuring privacy in LLM alignment, and the introduction of a tailored attack for privacy evaluation, I would assign the paper a score of **8**. This score reflects both its significant contributions and the areas where further work is needed to fully validate and extend the findings. **Score: 8**

### Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18533v1)
- **Authors**: Yi Ding, Lijun Li, Bing Cao, Jing Shao
- **Abstract**: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their deployment in safety-critical domains poses significant challenges. Existing safety fine-tuning methods, which focus on textual or multimodal content, fall short in addressing challenging cases or disrupt the balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. Our evaluation highlights a safety reasoning gap: these methods lack safety visual reasoning ability, leading to such bottlenecks. To address this limitation and enhance both visual perception and reasoning in safety-critical contexts, we propose a novel dataset that integrates multi-image inputs with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels as fine-grained reasoning logic to improve model performance. Specifically, we introduce the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, an instruction-following dataset tailored for multi-image safety scenarios, consisting of training and test splits. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning InternVL2.5-8B with MIS significantly outperforms both powerful open-source models and API-based models in challenging multi-image tasks requiring safety-related visual reasoning. This approach not only delivers exceptional safety performance but also preserves general capabilities without any trade-offs. Specifically, fine-tuning with MIS increases average accuracy by 0.83% across five general benchmarks and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) on multiple safety benchmarks by a large margin. Data and Models are released under: \href{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}{\texttt{https://dripnowhy.github.io/MIS/}}
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Rethinking Bottlenecks in Safety Fine-Tuning of Vision Language Models" addresses critical challenges associated with deploying large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in safety-sensitive applications. While these models excel in various tasks, existing safety fine-tuning approaches primarily concentrate on textual or multimodal inputs and do not adequately resolve complex safety scenarios or maintain a balance between helpfulness and harmlessness. The authors identify a distinct "safety reasoning gap," where current methods lack effective safety visual reasoning capabilities. To overcome these issues, the study introduces a new dataset called the Multi-Image Safety (MIS) dataset, which enriches the training process by incorporating multi-image inputs along with safety Chain-of-Thought (CoT) labels that indicate detailed reasoning logic. This dataset is designed specifically for improving models in safety-related scenarios involving multiple images. Through experimentation, the paper demonstrates that fine-tuning the InternVL2.5-8B model with the MIS dataset leads to substantial improvements in performance on challenging multi-image tasks that require robust safety-related visual reasoning. Notably, the fine-tuning approach achieves a 0.83% average accuracy increase across five general benchmarks and significantly lowers the Attack Success Rate on various safety benchmarks. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The introduction of the MIS dataset is a significant contribution that addresses a recognized gap in the current state of VLMs in safety domains. While many existing datasets mainly focus on single-image or textual contexts, the novel integration of multi-image inputs with CoT labels is a progressive step toward enhancing safety fine-tuning methodologies. **Significance:** The findings suggest that by centering safety reasoning in training VLMs, the proposed approach leads to substantial gains in safety performance without compromising overall model capabilities. Given the rising concern over the deployment of AI in safety-critical applications, this research contributes vital insights that can influence future developments and best practices in safety model training. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing a Critical Gap:** The paper identifies and tackles a significant shortcoming of current safety fine-tuning methods. 2. **Comprehensive Dataset:** The design and release of the MIS dataset provide valuable resources for further research in safety-related visual reasoning. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The experiments yield positive results that validate the practical efficacy of the proposed methodology. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Benchmarking:** While the experiments are promising, the benchmarks may not cover all possible safety scenarios. Further testing in diverse real-world applications could strengthen the findings. 2. **Potential Over-reliance on the Dataset:** The dependence on the MIS dataset may limit generalization to scenarios not represented in the dataset. Overall, the paper presents a noteworthy development in the safety fine-tuning of VLMs. The emphasis on visual reasoning and the data-driven approach is commendable and reflects a growing trend towards more responsible AI. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's significant contribution while recognizing some limitations in scope and the need for broader validation. The research holds notable potential for influencing future work within the field of AI safety and model training methodologies.

- **Abstract**: In recent years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) especially multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has enabled it to understand text, images, videos, and other multimedia data, allowing AI systems to execute various tasks based on human-provided prompts. However, AI-powered bots have increasingly been able to bypass most existing CAPTCHA systems, posing significant security threats to web applications. This makes the design of new CAPTCHA mechanisms an urgent priority. We observe that humans are highly sensitive to shifts and abrupt changes in videos, while current AI systems still struggle to comprehend and respond to such situations effectively. Based on this observation, we design and implement BounTCHA, a CAPTCHA mechanism that leverages human perception of boundaries in video transitions and disruptions. By utilizing AI's capability to expand original videos with prompts, we introduce unexpected twists and changes to create a pipeline for generating short videos for CAPTCHA purposes. We develop a prototype and conduct experiments to collect data on humans' time biases in boundary identification. This data serves as a basis for distinguishing between human users and bots. Additionally, we perform a detailed security analysis of BounTCHA, demonstrating its resilience against various types of attacks. We hope that BounTCHA will act as a robust defense, safeguarding millions of web applications in the AI-driven era.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "BounTCHA: A CAPTCHA Utilizing Boundary Identification in AI-extended Videos" addresses the growing security risks posed by AI-powered bots that can bypass traditional CAPTCHA systems. The authors propose a novel CAPTCHA mechanism named BounTCHA, which takes advantage of human sensitivity to abrupt visual changes in videos while identifying limitations in current AI's understanding of video contexts. BounTCHA involves generating videos that introduce unexpected shifts and transitions, thereby assessing users’ ability to identify boundaries within the visual content. The paper includes a prototype implementation and data collection on human response times in identifying these boundaries, aiming to clearly differentiate human users from AI bots. The authors also provide a comprehensive security analysis to demonstrate BounTCHA's effectiveness against potential attacks. The anticipated outcome is to enhance security for web applications in an increasingly AI-dominant landscape. ### Evaluation **Novelty:** BounTCHA is notable for its unique approach to CAPTCHA design, leveraging the human perception of boundaries in videos—a technique not typically employed in traditional text or image-based CAPTCHAs. This innovative use of multi-modal inputs and the focus on AI's current limitations in processing video content marks a significant conceptual advancement in the field. **Significance:** The paper's significance lies in its potential to improve web security in the face of advancing AI capabilities. By framing the CAPTCHA challenge around video disruptions and transitions, BounTCHA addresses a critical need as automated systems become more adept at solving conventional CAPTCHAs. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach**: The idea of using human perceptual strengths showcases a thoughtful understanding of where current AI systems falter. 2. **Empirical Basis**: The incorporation of experimental data regarding human time biases in boundary identification strengthens the argument for BounTCHA's effectiveness. 3. **Security Analysis**: Conducting a comprehensive security analysis adds credibility to the proposed solution and addresses potential practical concerns. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependency on Video Quality**: The efficacy of BounTCHA may be influenced by video quality, format, and environmental factors that can affect user engagement and response times. 2. **Implementation Feasibility**: The practicality of implementing such a CAPTCHA system across various web applications may pose challenges, especially in terms of user experience and accessibility. 3. **Scalability Concerns**: The system's ability to scale effectively and remain robust against increasingly sophisticated AI systems over time is not thoroughly discussed. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper offers a valuable contribution to the evolving domain of CAPTCHA systems by proposing a method tailored to exploit perceptual differences between humans and bots in video content.

### Token-Hungry, Yet Precise: DeepSeek R1 Highlights the Need for Multi-Step Reasoning Over Speed in MATH
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18576v1)
- **Authors**: Evgenii Evstafev
- **Abstract**: This study investigates the performance of the DeepSeek R1 language model on 30 challenging mathematical problems derived from the MATH dataset, problems that previously proved unsolvable by other models under time constraints. Unlike prior work, this research removes time limitations to explore whether DeepSeek R1's architecture, known for its reliance on token-based reasoning, can achieve accurate solutions through a multi-step process. The study compares DeepSeek R1 with four other models (gemini-1.5-flash-8b, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, llama3.1:8b, and mistral-8b-latest) across 11 temperature settings. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves superior accuracy on these complex problems but generates significantly more tokens than other models, confirming its token-intensive approach. The findings highlight a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in mathematical problem-solving with large language models: while DeepSeek R1 excels in accuracy, its reliance on extensive token generation may not be optimal for applications requiring rapid responses. The study underscores the importance of considering task-specific requirements when selecting an LLM and emphasizes the role of temperature settings in optimizing performance.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Token-Hungry, Yet Precise: DeepSeek R1 Highlights the Need for Multi-Step Reasoning Over Speed in MATH" investigates the performance of the DeepSeek R1 language model against 30 challenging mathematical problems from the MATH dataset. The study removes time constraints to assess whether DeepSeek R1 can utilize its token-based reasoning architecture to achieve accurate solutions via multi-step processes. In comparison with four other language models—including gemini-1.5-flash-8b and gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18—across 11 different temperature settings, results indicate that DeepSeek R1 outperforms its peers in terms of accuracy but produces a significantly higher number of tokens. This highlights a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in large language models for solving mathematical problems and emphasizes the influence of temperature settings on model performance. The research suggests that while DeepSeek R1 is adept at accuracy, it may not be the best choice for scenarios requiring quick responses, underscoring the importance of aligning model capabilities with task-specific demands. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The study presents a notable approach by examining the performance of DeepSeek R1 without time constraints, aiming to discern the implications of its token-intensive nature in mathematical problem-solving. Many prior studies have focused on speed or raw numbers in performance evaluations, while this paper emphasizes accuracy alongside the multi-step reasoning process. This methodological distinction contributes to a deeper understanding of language model capabilities. However, the exploration itself isn't entirely novel as the relationship between token generation and model performance has been somewhat documented in other studies. The choice of models for comparison is also a frequently employed methodology in model evaluations, not bringing high novelty in that respect. **Significance:** The significance of this paper lies in its exploration of the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. By providing empirical evidence that supports the notion that a more token-intensive strategy does yield higher accuracy, the study could inform future research directions and practical applications of language models in mathematics and possibly other domains. A potential limitation is that the focus on mathematical problems may narrow the applicability of the findings. While math is an essential domain, the broader implications for language models in general, especially in more diverse tasks, remain somewhat unaddressed. **Strengths:** - The study's systematic approach to including temperature settings is insightful, as it provides a nuanced understanding of the model's performance across various configurations. - The clear articulation of the accuracy versus efficiency dilemma is timely and relevant, particularly as large language models continue to proliferate in various applications. **Weaknesses:** - The paper could benefit from a discussion on the implications of high token generation in real-world applications, such as computational resource concerns. - A broader evaluation against a wider variety of tasks rather than concentrating solely on mathematical problems would enhance its significance. Considering the combination of these elements, the paper offers an important contribution, although with limitations in its scope and novelty. The trade-offs highlighted are crucial for practical decision-making in deploying language models. **Score:** 7

- **Authors**: Yue Wang, Qiuzhi Liu, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Xingyu Chen, Zhiwei He, Linfeng Song, Dian Yu, Juntao Li, Zhuosheng Zhang, Rui Wang, Zhaopeng Tu, Haitao Mi, Dong Yu
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's o1 have demonstrated remarkable abilities in complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute and exhibiting human-like deep thinking. However, we identify a phenomenon we term underthinking, where o1-like LLMs frequently switch between different reasoning thoughts without sufficiently exploring promising paths to reach a correct solution. This behavior leads to inadequate depth of reasoning and decreased performance, particularly on challenging mathematical problems. To systematically analyze this issue, we conduct experiments on three challenging test sets and two representative open-source o1-like models, revealing that frequent thought switching correlates with incorrect responses. We introduce a novel metric to quantify underthinking by measuring token efficiency in incorrect answers. To address underthinking, we propose a decoding strategy with thought switching penalty TIP that discourages premature transitions between thoughts, encouraging deeper exploration of each reasoning path. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy across challenging datasets without requiring model fine-tuning. Our findings contribute to understanding reasoning inefficiencies in o1-like LLMs and offer a practical solution to enhance their problem-solving capabilities.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Thoughts Are All Over the Place: On the Underthinking of o1-Like LLMs" highlights a critical issue observed in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's o1, termed "underthinking." This phenomenon involves the models' tendency to switch between different reasoning thoughts too rapidly, resulting in a lack of deep exploration of promising solution paths, particularly impacting their performance on complex mathematical tasks. The authors conduct experiments on several challenging test sets and o1-like models, demonstrating that frequent thought transitions are associated with incorrect answers. They introduce a new metric to measure underthinking based on token efficiency in incorrect responses. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose a decoding strategy called TIP that imposes a penalty on rapid thought switching, encouraging more in-depth exploration without needing to fine-tune the model. Their experimental results indicate an improvement in accuracy on challenging datasets, adding valuable insights into the reasoning inefficiencies of LLMs and offering actionable solutions for enhancing their problem-solving capabilities. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a distinctive angle on the performance limitations of LLMs by investigating the concept of "underthinking." This focus on reasoning depth rather than merely input-output capabilities is a noteworthy addition to the discourse surrounding LLMs, which typically emphasizes scaling and training data rather than cognitive processes. The introduction of a novel metric for quantifying this phenomenon is a significant contribution, as it provides a concrete way to evaluate underthinking, bolstering future research in this area. The proposal of the TIP decoding strategy is practical as it does not necessitate fine-tuning, making it accessible for immediate implementation in various applications. Experimental validation of the proposed solutions adds further credibility to the findings. However, the paper could be strengthened by including a broader range of models beyond the two analyzed and providing more extensive comparisons against existing methods aimed at improving reasoning in LLMs. Moreover, while the novel concepts introduced are compelling, the implications for the broader field of AI and LLMs might still be limited if the solutions cannot be generalized beyond mathematical reasoning tasks. The paper does not explore potential limitations or challenges in implementing the proposed strategies, which would give a more balanced perspective. **Score: 8** The paper demonstrates significant novelty by addressing an underexplored aspect of LLM performance. Its contributions to understanding reasoning inefficiencies and providing a practical solution through TIP make a meaningful impact in the field. However, the analysis could benefit from broader model examinations and a more thorough discussion of potential limitations, justifying a score of 8.

- **Authors**: Ruofan Liang, Zan Gojcic, Huan Ling, Jacob Munkberg, Jon Hasselgren, Zhi-Hao Lin, Jun Gao, Alexander Keller, Nandita Vijaykumar, Sanja Fidler, Zian Wang
- **Abstract**: Understanding and modeling lighting effects are fundamental tasks in computer vision and graphics. Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce DiffusionRenderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Experiments demonstrate that DiffusionRenderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our model enables practical applications from a single video input--including relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "DiffusionRenderer: Neural Inverse and Forward Rendering with Video Diffusion Models" introduces DiffusionRenderer, a novel neural framework aimed at addressing the challenges of both inverse and forward rendering in computer graphics and vision. Traditional physically-based rendering (PBR) methods require detailed scene information, such as accurate 3D geometry, material properties, and lighting conditions, which may not always be feasible to obtain from real-world scenarios. The authors propose DiffusionRenderer as a solution that utilizes video diffusion models to estimate G-buffers from real-world videos in an inverse rendering context. This process not only facilitates image editing but also generates training data for the rendering model. Furthermore, the forward rendering aspect of DiffusionRenderer creates photorealistic images from the estimated G-buffers, bypassing the need for explicit light transport simulations. The experimental results indicate that DiffusionRenderer surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for practical applications like relighting, material editing, and realistic object insertion using just a single video input. --- **Evaluation:** **Novelty and Significance:** The introduction of DiffusionRenderer reflects a significant step toward making rendering processes more accessible by leveraging neural networks, particularly video diffusion models, which have rapidly gained traction in recent years. The dual-focus on both inverse and forward rendering is a noteworthy aspect, as it offers a more integrated approach compared to separate traditional methods. This integration can streamline workflows for computer vision and graphics practitioners, particularly in scenarios where obtaining detailed scene representations is challenging. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The use of video diffusion models to simultaneously tackle inverse and forward rendering is innovative and could influence further research in the domain. 2. **Real-World Application:** The ability to perform complex image manipulations based solely on video inputs offers a substantial advancement for practical applications in multiple industries, such as film production, virtual reality, and game development. 3. **Experimental Results:** The reported superiority of the model over existing methods strengthens the paper's claim of effectiveness and establishes it as a promising alternative. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Video Quality:** The performance of DiffusionRenderer may heavily rely on the quality of the input video, which could limit its applicability in scenarios where videos are noisy or poorly captured. 2. **Generalization:** While experiments demonstrate high performance, the extent to which the model generalizes across diverse types of scenes, lighting conditions, and materials remains uncertain. 3. **Complexity of Implementation:** The reliance on neural networks and video models may introduce complexity that could hinder adoption by practitioners who lack the necessary computational resources or expertise. Overall, considering the balance between its innovative contributions and its current limitations, I believe DiffusionRenderer represents a noteworthy advancement in the field, but with areas needing improvement before it can be broadly implemented. **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in learning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a simple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations for image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning objective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image tokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our insight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current state-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of heuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on non-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We show design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to scale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show that DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the current state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves competitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and downstream image generation tasks.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces a novel approach to image tokenization through a method called Diffusion Tokenizer (DiTo), which utilizes a diffusion L2 loss as its single learning objective. This method aims to create compact visual representations conducive to image generation models. The authors argue that DiTo simplifies the training process compared to current state-of-the-art tokenizers that depend on a complex mix of heuristics and various losses along with supervised pretraining. The paper provides both theoretical grounding and practical design choices to scale DiTo effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that DiTo offers competitive or superior performance in image reconstruction and related tasks, positioning it as a simpler and scalable self-supervised alternative to existing supervised tokenization methods. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its approach to simplifying the image tokenization process. By leveraging a single, effective learning objective (diffusion L2 loss) within the established framework of diffusion models for image generation, the authors present a compelling case for reducing the complexity typically associated with training image tokenizers. This simplification could have significant implications for researchers and practitioners looking to build or improve generative models without the burden of managing intricate training recipes. Strengths of the paper include: 1. **Simplicity and Scalability:** DiTo’s approach reduces training complexity while maintaining performance, which is attractive for broader applicability. 2. **Competitive Results:** Demonstrating performance that matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods adds credibility to the proposed method. 3. **Theoretical Immersion:** The inclusion of theoretical grounding provides a sound basis for the proposed approach, allowing the community to better understand its foundations. However, there are several weaknesses to consider: 1. **Empirical Validation:** While the paper claims competitive performance, more extensive comparisons with other tokenizers across diverse datasets and more complex tasks would strengthen claims. 2. **Lack of Novel Mechanisms:** The reliance on the established diffusion process does not contribute new mechanisms to the field but rather a reapplication in a slightly different context. 3. **Broader Impact:** The significance of DiTo in the broader context of generative modeling and related tasks could be further elaborated.  Given these strengths and weaknesses, I would assign a score of **7**. The paper does present a valuable contribution to simplifying image tokenization through a novel application of diffusion processes and provides competitive performance insights. However, the lack of new underlying mechanisms and the need for broader empirical validation limit its novelty and impact to some extent. Overall, it represents a meaningful step forward, but not as groundbreaking as works that introduce fundamentally new architectures or paradigms.  **Score: 7**
