- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910v1)
- **Authors**: Michael Muehlebach, Zhiyu He, Michael I. Jordan
- **Abstract**: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper explores the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in nonlinear dynamical systems, focusing on systems with continuous state and action spaces. It proposes an algorithm that achieves a policy regret characterized as $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$ across a broad range of dynamical systems, including finite nonlinear models and those defined by bounded metrics. For systems with compact, real-valued parameter spaces—common in contemporary models like neural networks—the regret is reduced to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, thus extending previous findings from linear systems to more complex settings. The algorithms are noted for their simplicity, applicability of prior knowledge, and stable initial performance. **Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The study provides a significant contribution by extending well-established sample complexity results from linear time-invariant systems to a more general context including nonlinear systems and various forms of dynamics. This expansion is crucial as many real-world systems exhibit nonlinear characteristics, making the findings highly relevant. **Significance:** The results have the potential to impact both theoretical understanding and practical applications in reinforcement learning, particularly in complex environments where incorporating prior knowledge and having robust performance in transient phases are beneficial. Additionally, the discussion on packing numbers adds a nuanced perspective to the existing navigation of function approximations in learning systems, which is a notable addition. **Strengths:** 1. **Broad Applicability:** The inclusion of diverse dynamical systems expands the algorithm's potential utility across different applications. 2. **Rigorous Analysis:** The mathematical rigor in deriving regret bounds contributes to the theoretical foundation of the field. 3. **Practical Relevance:** The focus on simple algorithms that incorporate prior knowledge can enhance practitioners' ability to deploy these methods effectively. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity in Implementation:** While the theoretical frameworks are compelling, the practical implementation of the proposed algorithms for diverse systems can be complex. Clear guidelines or case studies illustrating this could improve accessibility. 2. **Limited Novel Implementation Details:** The paper discusses algorithms in a theoretical context but could enhance its contribution by providing examples or experimental results showcasing how these algorithms perform in simulated environments. **Conclusion:** Overall, the paper represents an important step in understanding online reinforcement learning in nonlinear contexts. Its approach to sample complexity is novel and expands the horizon of potential applications. However, the practical implications and full realization of the theoretical results still require further exploration and validation. The combination of theory and a call to practice merits a high evaluation but is moderated by the need for applied depth. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15915v1)
- **Authors**: Weihang Su, Yichen Tang, Qingyao Ai, Junxi Yan, Changyue Wang, Hongning Wang, Ziyi Ye, Yujia Zhou, Yiqun Liu
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have emerged as a promising solution to enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs) by addressing issues like hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and domain adaptation. In particular, existing RAG methods append relevant documents retrieved from external corpus or databases to the input of LLMs to guide their generation process, which we refer to as the in-context knowledge injection method. While this approach is simple and often effective, it has inherent limitations. Firstly, increasing the context length and number of relevant documents can lead to higher computational overhead and degraded performance, especially in complex reasoning tasks. More importantly, in-context knowledge injection operates primarily at the input level, but LLMs store their internal knowledge in their parameters. This gap fundamentally limits the capacity of in-context methods. To this end, we introduce Parametric retrieval-augmented generation (Parametric RAG), a new RAG paradigm that integrates external knowledge directly into the parameters of feed-forward networks (FFN) of an LLM through document parameterization. This approach not only saves online computational costs by eliminating the need to inject multiple documents into the LLMs' input context, but also deepens the integration of external knowledge into the parametric knowledge space of the LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that Parametric RAG substantially enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation in LLMs. Also, it can be combined with in-context RAG methods to achieve even better performance. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models in the following anonymized GitHub link: https://github.com/oneal2000/PRAG
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation" discusses a novel approach to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques that enhance the reliability of large language models (LLMs). Traditional RAG methods utilize in-context knowledge injection, where relevant documents are appended to the input of LLMs to guide generation. However, this method has limitations such as increased computational costs and limited integration of external knowledge into the model’s internal parameters.  To address these shortcomings, the authors propose "Parametric RAG," which integrates external knowledge directly into the feed-forward network parameters of LLMs using document parameterization. This integration reduces the overhead of processing multiple documents at the input level and deepens the assimilation of external knowledge into the model's inherent knowledge structure. The experimental results indicate that Parametric RAG significantly improves both the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge augmentation. Additionally, the authors mention that this method can be combined with traditional in-context RAG approaches for enhanced performance. The paper's code, data, and models have been made publicly available. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty and Contribution:**  The introduction of Parametric RAG presents a significant advancement in the field of LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation. While in-context knowledge injection has been widely accepted, it suffers from performance and efficiency issues that the proposed mechanism directly addresses. The notion of integrating external documents into the model's internal parameters, rather than through input context alone, is an innovative approach that has the potential to reshape how knowledge is utilized within LLMs. This paradigm shift indicates a deeper embedding of external information which is a major strength.  **Strengths:** 1. **Efficiency Improvement:** The paper convincingly argues that the Parametric RAG approach lowers computational costs, an important consideration given the increasing resource demands of LLMs. 2. **Enhanced Capability:** By allowing a deeper integration of knowledge, the approach likely improves the overall capability of LLMs, particularly in reasoning tasks where contextual understanding is crucial. 3. **Practical Relevance:** The authors have made their work accessible through open-sourcing, enhancing the potential for adoption and further research. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Parameterization:** The method’s reliance on document parameterization requires careful consideration of the quality and diversity of the documents being parameterized, which could impact model performance. 2. **Experimental Validation:** While the paper reports significant improvements, details on evaluations across various real-world tasks, datasets, and comparisons to more established methods (like traditional RAG) would strengthen the claims. 3. **Scalability Concerns:** The method may face challenges scaling to extremely large models or corpora, which could limit its applicability in some contexts. **Overall Impact:** The proposed methodology is poised to influence future research directions in how knowledge is incorporated into LLMs, potentially inspiring more work on parameter-based integration strategies rather than solely in-context methods. However, the overall impact is contingent on thorough experimental validation across diverse tasks and datasets. ### Score: 8 This score reflects the paper's substantial innovations in addressing pressing limitations of existing RAG methods and its promising implications for improving LLMs. However, the exploratory nature combined with some unresolved scalability and validation concerns prevents a higher score. The contributions are relevant and significant, but further exploration is needed to fully establish their effectiveness across varying contexts.

- **Authors**: Benjamin C. Carter, Jonathan Rivas Contreras, Carlos A. Llanes Villegas, Pawan Acharya, Jack Utzerath, Adonijah O. Farner, Hunter Jenkins, Dylan Johnson, Jacob Penney, Igor Steinmacher, Marco A. Gerosa, Fabio Santos
- **Abstract**: New contributors often struggle to find tasks that they can tackle when onboarding onto a new Open Source Software (OSS) project. One reason for this difficulty is that issue trackers lack explanations about the knowledge or skills needed to complete a given task successfully. These explanations can be complex and time-consuming to produce. Past research has partially addressed this problem by labeling issues with issue types, issue difficulty level, and issue skills. However, current approaches are limited to a small set of labels and lack in-depth details about their semantics, which may not sufficiently help contributors identify suitable issues. To surmount this limitation, this paper explores large language models (LLMs) and Random Forest (RF) to predict the multilevel skills required to solve the open issues. We introduce a novel tool, SkillScope, which retrieves current issues from Java projects hosted on GitHub and predicts the multilevel programming skills required to resolve these issues. In a case study, we demonstrate that SkillScope could predict 217 multilevel skills for tasks with 91% precision, 88% recall, and 89% F-measure on average. Practitioners can use this tool to better delegate or choose tasks to solve in OSS projects.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents SkillScope, a tool designed to aid new contributors in Open Source Software (OSS) projects by predicting the specific skills needed to tackle ongoing issues on GitHub. It identifies a significant barrier that new contributors face: the absence of detailed explanations about the skills required for tasks in issue trackers. Previous research has made strides in this area by categorizing issues by type, difficulty, and skills but has not gone into sufficient depth. SkillScope uses large language models (LLMs) and Random Forest techniques to extract and predict a comprehensive set of multilevel programming skills from current issues in Java projects on GitHub. In a validation case study, SkillScope achieved impressive predictive performance, reporting a precision of 91%, recall of 88%, and an F-measure of 89%. The tool has practical implications, enabling project maintainers to better assign and manage tasks within OSS projects. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this paper lies primarily in its approach to enhancing issue tracking systems for OSS. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques (specifically LLMs and Random Forest) to predict fine-grained skill requirements, the paper addresses a critical pain point in the OSS community: onboarding new contributors effectively. This suggests a step forward from simply categorizing issues, as it attempts to provide a deeper understanding of contributor needs. **Strengths:** 1. **Technical Innovation**: The use of advanced machine learning models to derive meaningful skill insights is commendable and indicates a modern approach to problem-solving in software development. 2. **High Prediction Performance**: The reported metrics (91% precision, 88% recall, 89% F-measure) suggest that the tool is highly effective, which is critical for practical adoption by OSS communities. 3. **Real-world Application**: The focus on current issues in popular programming languages like Java ensures relevance, enhancing the likelihood of tool adoption. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While promising, the study primarily focuses on Java projects. Its effectiveness across different programming languages or frameworks has not been evaluated, which could limit its applicability. 2. **Scalability**: The performance metrics are derived from a case study; the paper could benefit from a broader evaluation across various OSS projects to demonstrate scalability and robustness. 3. **User-Centric Considerations**: The paper could further explore the user interface and experience aspects of the SkillScope tool, as usability will significantly influence adoption rates among OSS contributors. In conclusion, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of software engineering, particularly in the context of Open Source Software development. Given its innovative approach, solid metrics, and practical utility, it holds significant potential for future research and application. However, to reach its full impact, the tool's effectiveness should be validated in a broader context beyond Java. **Score: 8**

- **Authors**: Zhang Liu, Dusit Niyato, Jiacheng Wang, Geng Sun, Lianfen Huang, Zhibin Gao, Xianbin Wang
- **Abstract**: Lyapunov optimization theory has recently emerged as a powerful mathematical framework for solving complex stochastic optimization problems by transforming long-term objectives into a sequence of real-time short-term decisions while ensuring system stability. This theory is particularly valuable in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking scenarios, where it could effectively address inherent challenges of dynamic network conditions, multiple optimization objectives, and stability requirements. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has garnered significant attention for its unprecedented capability to generate diverse digital content. Extending beyond content generation, in this paper, we propose a framework integrating generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to address Lyapunov optimization problems in UAV-based LAE networking. We begin by introducing the fundamentals of Lyapunov optimization theory and analyzing the limitations of both conventional methods and traditional AI-enabled approaches. We then examine various GenAI models and comprehensively analyze their potential contributions to Lyapunov optimization. Subsequently, we develop a Lyapunov-guided generative diffusion model-based reinforcement learning framework and validate its effectiveness through a UAV-based LAE networking case study. Finally, we outline several directions for future research.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents a novel integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and Lyapunov optimization theory to tackle the challenges posed by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based low-altitude economy (LAE) networking. The authors describe Lyapunov optimization as a framework that allows for real-time short-term decision-making while maintaining system stability in the face of dynamics and multiple optimization objectives typical in UAV scenarios. They introduce a framework that combines generative diffusion models with reinforcement learning to enhance the efficiency of solving Lyapunov optimization problems. The paper includes a critical analysis of conventional optimization methods and AI techniques, explores the capabilities of various GenAI models, and validates the proposed framework through a UAV-based case study. Directions for further research are also discussed to encourage continued exploration in this area. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The integration of GenAI with Lyapunov optimization is relatively pioneering, especially within the specific context of UAV-based applications. While Lyapunov optimization is well-established, the fresh approach of combining it with generative models and reinforcement learning establishes a new frontier in operationalizing complex optimization scenarios in real-time environments. The novelty lies in the potential for this combination to address dynamic network conditions that UAVs face, which traditional optimization methods struggle to manage. **Significance:** The application of this work is significant for the fast-developing field of drone networking, particularly as it relates to optimizing network performance and stability in low-altitude conditions, which are expected to grow in importance with the increasing use of UAVs for various applications. However, the success of this work relies on its practical implementation and evaluation beyond theoretical frameworks. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of generative models and reinforcements learning with Lyapunov optimization could set a new standard for efficiently tackling complex optimization issues in fast-evolving environments like UAV networks. 2. **Comprehensive Analysis:** The exploration of various GenAI models and traditional optimization methods ensures that the authors provide a well-rounded examination of the topic. 3. **Future Research Directions:** By outlining prospective avenues for further inquiry, the paper encourages ongoing academic exploration, which can enhance the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Evaluation Limits:** The case study serves as validation for the proposed framework, but it would benefit from more in-depth experiments across different scenarios to better understand the model's robustness and scalability. 2. **Complexity Issues:** The integration of advanced AI techniques might lead to higher computational complexity, and without careful consideration, it could become less feasible in real-world applications. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, while the paper demonstrates significant innovation and relevance, particularly in the context of UAV networking and dynamic optimization, the evaluation methodology and practical considerations such as scaling and efficiency still require further clarity. The contributions made here have the potential to impact the field positively, primarily as UAV applications expand. **Score: 8**  This score reflects high, but not exemplary, novelty and impact, as the proposed framework opens avenues for advancements but requires additional empirical validation and practical efficacy considerations to fully realize its potential in the field.

### Leveraging multi-task learning to improve the detection of SATD and vulnerability
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15934v1)
- **Authors**: Barbara Russo, Jorge Melegati, Moritz Mock
- **Abstract**: Multi-task learning is a paradigm that leverages information from related tasks to improve the performance of machine learning. Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) are comments in the code that indicate not-quite-right code introduced for short-term needs, i.e., technical debt (TD). Previous research has provided evidence of a possible relationship between SATD and the existence of vulnerabilities in the code. In this work, we investigate if multi-task learning could leverage the information shared between SATD and vulnerabilities to improve the automatic detection of these issues. To this aim, we implemented VulSATD, a deep learner that detects vulnerable and SATD code based on CodeBERT, a pre-trained transformers model. We evaluated VulSATD on MADE-WIC, a fused dataset of functions annotated for TD (through SATD) and vulnerability. We compared the results using single and multi-task approaches, obtaining no significant differences even after employing a weighted loss. Our findings indicate the need for further investigation into the relationship between these two aspects of low-quality code. Specifically, it is possible that only a subset of technical debt is directly associated with security concerns. Therefore, the relationship between different types of technical debt and software vulnerabilities deserves future exploration and a deeper understanding.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Leveraging multi-task learning to improve the detection of SATD and vulnerability" investigates the application of multi-task learning to enhance the detection of Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) and software vulnerabilities. SATD refers to code comments that acknowledge suboptimal solutions made for short-term necessity, which can potentially contribute to vulnerabilities. The authors implemented a model named VulSATD, based on CodeBERT, to automatically identify both SATD and code vulnerabilities. They evaluated this model using the MADE-WIC dataset, which combines functions annotated for both SATD and vulnerabilities. The results indicated no significant difference in detection performance between single-task and multi-task approaches, despite attempts to improve outcomes with a weighted loss function. The study concludes that further investigation into the associations between different types of technical debt and security vulnerabilities is warranted, suggesting that only specific categories of SATD may relate to security concerns. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper presents a relevant investigation in a critical area of software quality, linking SATD and vulnerabilities through machine learning techniques. However, while the application of multi-task learning is a contemporary and promising approach in machine learning, its utility in this particular instance appears limited as indicated by the lack of significant performance improvements compared to single-task methods. **Strengths:** 1. **Relevance:** The topic addresses important issues in software engineering, particularly the management of technical debt and its implications for security vulnerabilities. 2. **Methodology:** The paper employs a solid technical framework (CodeBERT) and offers an interesting intersection of machine learning with software maintenance practices. 3. **Future Implications:** It opens avenues for further research by suggesting that not all SATD is equally associated with vulnerabilities, which may direct future studies to focus on more specific technical debt categorizations. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Significant Findings:** The central claim of improved detection via multi-task learning is unsubstantiated, with no significant performance difference found, which undermines the paper's main contribution. 2. **Depth of Analysis:** The paper could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of why the expected relationships and performance improvements did not materialize. Additionally, the examination of the nuances within SATD and their varied impacts seems underexplored. 3. **Limited Empirical Contribution:** Given that the findings do not yield substantial new knowledge, it raises questions about how the insights can contribute to practical applications or further advancements in the field. In conclusion, while the research is positioned in a critical area of software engineering, the lack of significant findings and limited exploration of the implications restricts its novelty and impact. The need for deeper analysis and exploration of the relationships established shows that while the research is promising, it does not substantially advance the current understanding or applications in the field. **Score: 5**

- **Abstract**: Time series neural networks perform exceptionally well in real-world applications but encounter challenges such as limited scalability, poor generalization, and suboptimal zero-shot performance. Inspired by large language models, there is interest in developing large time series models (LTM) to address these issues. However, current methods struggle with training complexity, adapting human feedback, and achieving high predictive accuracy. We introduce TimeHF, a novel pipeline for creating LTMs with 6 billion parameters, incorporating human feedback. We use patch convolutional embedding to capture long time series information and design a human feedback mechanism called time-series policy optimization. Deployed in JD.com's supply chain, TimeHF handles automated replenishment for over 20,000 products, improving prediction accuracy by 33.21% over existing methods. This work advances LTM technology and shows significant industrial benefits.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces TimeHF, a new approach to large time series models (LTM) that integrates human feedback to enhance scalability, generalization, and predictive accuracy in time series forecasting. TimeHF comprises 6 billion parameters and employs patch convolutional embedding for effective long-term feature extraction. The innovative time-series policy optimization mechanism leverages human input to refine the model's performance.

Its emphasis on human feedback could inspire future research into interactive machine learning methods in various domains. **Score Justification:** Considering the strengths in novelty, the practical demonstration of impact, and the potential for inspiring future work, TimeHF merits a score on the higher end of the scale. However, some limitations regarding complexity and domain specificity prevent it from reaching the very top score. **Score: 8**

### MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15981v1)
- **Authors**: Michael Birsak, John Femiani, Biao Zhang, Peter Wonka
- **Abstract**: Assigning realistic materials to 3D models remains a significant challenge in computer graphics. We propose MatCLIP, a novel method that extracts shape- and lighting-insensitive descriptors of Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to assign plausible textures to 3D objects based on images, such as the output of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) or photographs. Matching PBR materials to static images is challenging because the PBR representation captures the dynamic appearance of materials under varying viewing angles, shapes, and lighting conditions. By extending an Alpha-CLIP-based model on material renderings across diverse shapes and lighting, and encoding multiple viewing conditions for PBR materials, our approach generates descriptors that bridge the domains of PBR representations with photographs or renderings, including LDM outputs. This enables consistent material assignments without requiring explicit knowledge of material relationships between different parts of an object. MatCLIP achieves a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points on publicly available datasets. Our method can be used to construct material assignments for 3D shape datasets such as ShapeNet, 3DCoMPaT++, and Objaverse. All code and data will be released.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "MatCLIP: Light- and Shape-Insensitive Assignment of PBR Material Models" introduces MatCLIP, an innovative approach for assigning realistic Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials to 3D models in the context of varying shapes and lighting conditions. It highlights the complexities involved in matching PBR materials to static images—especially given the dynamic nature of these materials under different viewing angles. MatCLIP builds on the Alpha-CLIP framework to create descriptors that link PBR material representations with images generated by Diffusion Models or photographs, effectively allowing for the transfer of material attributes without needing detailed knowledge about the relationships between different parts of a 3D object. The authors report impressive results, achieving a top-1 classification accuracy of 76.6%, which surpasses existing methods like PhotoShape and MatAtlas by over 15 percentage points across various datasets such as ShapeNet and 3DCoMPaT++. The authors commit to releasing all associated code and data, promoting further research and practical application of their findings. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty:**  MatCLIP presents a notable advancement in the integration of PBR materials with static images, addressing a long-standing challenge in the graphics community. The incorporation of Alpha-CLIP to generate light- and shape-insensitive descriptors marks a significant methodological innovation. This is particularly relevant given the increasing reliance on machine learning to bridge the gap between traditional rendering techniques and realistic material representations.  **Significance:**  The improvement in classification accuracy (76.6%) relative to existing state-of-the-art methods (15 percentage points better than PhotoShape and MatAtlas) indicates not only a technical achievement but also practical applicability, which enhances its significance. The focus on making material assignments consistent across various conditions can influence workflows in computer graphics and gaming, as well as in fields such as virtual reality and architecture. **Strengths:** 1. **Robust Methodology:** The use of an extended Alpha-CLIP model shows robust theoretical grounding and application. 2. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides extensive validation of its results against established methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. 3. **Open Access Commitment:** The promise to release code and data encourages reproducibility and fosters further research in the field. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Specificity of Application:** While the method shows promising results, its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific characteristics of the objects and images used, a factor that could limit broader applicability. 2. **Lack of Deep Comparative Analysis:** There is limited discussion on why MatCLIP outperforms its competitors beyond accuracy metrics; an in-depth analysis of the model’s performance on different object types or conditions would have provided more insight. **Potential Influence:**  The methodology proposed in MatCLIP represents a key step towards more automated and accurate assignment of PBR materials, which could streamline workflows in various industries reliant on 3D modeling, including gaming, film, and design. **Score Justification:** Taking into account the methodological contributions, empirical results, and practical significance, but balancing this against the limitations in application specificity and comparative analysis depth, a score of 8 is warranted. This reflects strong novelty and potential impact, while acknowledging room for further exploration and validation in diverse contexts. Score: 8

### Improving Tropical Cyclone Forecasting With Video Diffusion Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16003v1)
- **Authors**: Zhibo Ren, Pritthijit Nath, Pancham Shukla
- **Abstract**: Tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting is crucial for disaster preparedness and mitigation. While recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, existing methods often treat TC evolution as a series of independent frame-to-frame predictions, limiting their ability to capture long-term dynamics. We present a novel application of video diffusion models for TC forecasting that explicitly models temporal dependencies through additional temporal layers. Our approach enables the model to generate multiple frames simultaneously, better capturing cyclone evolution patterns. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that significantly improves individual-frame quality and performance in low-data regimes. Experimental results show our method outperforms the previous approach of Nath et al. by 19.3% in MAE, 16.2% in PSNR, and 36.1% in SSIM. Most notably, we extend the reliable forecasting horizon from 36 to 50 hours. Through comprehensive evaluation using both traditional metrics and Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD), we demonstrate that our approach produces more temporally coherent forecasts while maintaining competitive single-frame quality. Code accessible at https://github.com/Ren-creater/forecast-video-diffmodels.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents an innovative application of video diffusion models for improving tropical cyclone (TC) forecasting, addressing limitations in current deep learning approaches that fail to adequately capture the temporal dynamics of cyclone evolution. By incorporating additional temporal layers and a two-stage training strategy, the method allows for simultaneous generation of multiple prediction frames, enhancing the model's ability to predict cyclone behavior over time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over previous methods by Nath et al., quantifiable by metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). The approach extends the reliable forecast window from 36 to 50 hours, showing both superior temporal coherence and competitive single-frame quality. Code for the methodology is publicly accessible for further use and exploration. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of this work lies primarily in the employment of video diffusion models with a focus on TC forecasting—a relatively underexplored area within computational meteorology. While there has been a rise in deep learning techniques applied to various aspects of weather prediction, extending the reliable forecasting horizon and improving the quality of predictions are both critical areas that would benefit from advanced methodologies. The paper effectively addresses the shortcomings of treating cyclone evolution as a sequence of independent frames, therefore presenting a meaningful advancement in understanding and predicting TC behavior. However, the paper's impact could be nuanced by a few factors. Firstly, while improvements in forecasting metrics are notable, the benchmark comparisons rest on one previous approach (Nath et al.), potentially limiting the assessment of the method's relative performance within a broader scope of existing approaches. Additionally, the methodology assumes that better temporal coherence directly correlates with improved predictive capabilities, which could benefit from more extensive validation against real-world cyclone events. More real-world testing, alongside comparisons with a wider array of state-of-the-art methodologies, would strengthen the validity of the claims made. Furthermore, the complexity of implementation (i.e., a two-stage training strategy) might hinder replication and wider adoption in operational settings. This could impact the overall applicability of the findings in real-world scenarios, as practitioners might seek simpler and more direct methods for TC forecasting. Despite these weaknesses, the paper represents a progressive step in TC forecasting by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. The explicit modeling of temporal dependencies could stimulate further research and development in this domain, promoting more robust forecasting methods overall. **Score: 8**  This score reflects strong novelty and potential significance within the field of TC forecasting, while acknowledging the need for broader validation and assessment against other methodologies to fully establish its impact.

- **Authors**: Jack Min Ong, Matthew Di Ferrante, Aaron Pazdera, Ryan Garner, Sami Jaghouar, Manveer Basra, Johannes Hagemann
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be very capable, but access to the best models currently rely on inference providers which introduces trust challenges -- how can we be sure that the provider is using the model configuration they claim? We propose TOPLOC, a novel method for verifiable inference that addresses this problem. TOPLOC leverages a compact locality sensitive hashing mechanism for intermediate activations which can detect unauthorized modifications to models, prompts, or precision with 100% accuracy, achieving no false positives or negatives in our empirical evaluations. Our approach is robust across diverse hardware configurations, GPU types, and algebraic reorderings, which allows for validation speeds significantly faster than the original inference. By introducing a polynomial encoding scheme, TOPLOC minimizes memory overhead of the generated commits by $1000\times$, requiring only 258 bytes of storage per 32 new tokens compared to the 262KB requirement of storing the token embeddings directly for Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our method empowers users to verify LLM inference computations efficiently, fostering greater trust and transparency in open ecosystems and lays a foundation for decentralized and verifiable AI services.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces TOPLOC, a novel locality sensitive hashing scheme designed to ensure verifiable inference from large language models (LLMs) while addressing trust issues with inference providers. The proposed method detects unauthorized changes to models or inputs with absolute accuracy, reporting no false positives or negatives during testing. TOPLOC is hardware-agnostic, allowing for rapid validation of inference processes. Importantly, it employs a polynomial encoding strategy that drastically reduces the memory footprint required for storing intermediate results, compressing data needs by 1000 times—for instance, requiring only 258 bytes for 32 tokens compared to the traditional 262KB. This innovative approach enhances user verification capabilities, thereby promoting transparency and trust in AI services within decentralized frameworks. **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  TOPLOC presents a unique solution to a pressing issue in the field of LLMs, where reliance on third-party providers often introduces significant trust concerns. By leveraging locality-sensitive hashing for intermediate activations, the paper contributes a fresh perspective on model verification that is both practical and scalable. The mathematical innovation in encoding further enhances its novelty by addressing the usual memory constraints associated with model verification. **Significance:** The significance of TOPLOC is considerable, particularly in an age where AI transparency is paramount. With increasing instances of malicious model tampering and rising importance on ethical AI, the ability for users to definitively verify the integrity of LLM computations can lead to more accountable AI ecosystems. Additionally, the approach's applicability across various platforms mitigates concerns about hardware specificity, increasing its potential adoption. **Strengths:** - The empirical results supporting the 100% accuracy claim are a strong point, as they suggest a reliable methodology. - The 1000× compression of memory usage is a substantial technical accomplishment, making the scheme desirable for real-world applications where resources are limited. - The broad hardware compatibility enhances its practicality. **Weaknesses:** - While the paper claims no false positives or negatives, the long-term reliability of TOPLOC in diverse, untested operational contexts remains to be seen in future work. - The paper could benefit from a comparativa analysis with existing verification techniques to better contextualize its advantages. - The paper does not discuss potential vulnerabilities or limitations, such as the implications of different types of attacks beyond standard model tampering. **Conclusion:** Overall, TOPLOC represents a meaningful advancement in the verifiability of model inference, addressing a crucial gap in the trust landscape associated with LLMs. Its conceptual and practical contributions mark it as significant; however, the recognition of potential weaknesses indicates areas for further exploration and enhancement. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's substantial contributions and innovative approach to a real-world problem within the AI field while acknowledging some limitations and the need for further validation in wider contexts.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029v1)
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Fu, Junfan Chen, Hongyu Sun, Ting Yang, Ruidong Li, Yuqing Zhang
- **Abstract**: Using large language models (LLMs) integration platforms without transparency about which LLM is being invoked can lead to potential security risks. Specifically, attackers may exploit this black-box scenario to deploy malicious models and embed viruses in the code provided to users. In this context, it is increasingly urgent for users to clearly identify the LLM they are interacting with, in order to avoid unknowingly becoming victims of malicious models. However, existing studies primarily focus on mixed classification of human and machine-generated text, with limited attention to classifying texts generated solely by different models. Current research also faces dual bottlenecks: poor quality of LLM-generated text (LLMGT) datasets and limited coverage of detectable LLMs, resulting in poor detection performance for various LLMGT in black-box scenarios. We propose the first LLMGT fingerprint detection model, \textbf{FDLLM}, based on Qwen2.5-7B and fine-tuned using LoRA to address these challenges. FDLLM can more efficiently handle detection tasks across multilingual and multi-domain scenarios. Furthermore, we constructed a dataset named \textbf{FD-Datasets}, consisting of 90,000 samples that span multiple languages and domains, covering 20 different LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that FDLLM achieves a macro F1 score 16.7\% higher than the best baseline method, LM-D.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel method termed FDLLM, designed for detecting text fingerprints from large language models (LLMs) in environments characterized by their black-box nature. The authors highlight the security concerns associated with the opaque integration of LLMs, where users might inadvertently engage with malicious models. To mitigate this risk, the paper addresses the limitations of existing research which often fails to focus specifically on distinguishing texts generated by various models, rather only categorizing human versus machine-generated content. The authors introduce FDLLM, which utilizes the Qwen2.5-7B model and employs fine-tuning via LoRA to improve detection capabilities across multiple languages and domains. They also developed a new dataset, FD-Datasets, consisting of 90,000 samples from 20 LLMs, to facilitate effective training and evaluation. Experimental results showed that FDLLM outperforms the best existing method (LM-D) by a significant margin of 16.7% in macro F1 score, underscoring its potential utility in enhancing LLM recognition in black-box settings. ### Evaluation #### Novelty and Significance The novelty of FDLLM lies in its focus on text fingerprint detection from LLMs in a black-box environment, an area that has been underexplored in previous research. By creating a dedicated pipeline to differentiate between outputs of various LLMs, the authors address a crucial gap pertinent to security and accountability. The implementation of a multilingual and multi-domain approach reflects an understanding of the diverse contexts in which LLMs are employed today, reinforcing its applicability. However, the paper does present some weaknesses. The reliance on the LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2.5-7B model could introduce limitations if future models exceed the capabilities of Qwen2.5-7B in generating text. Moreover, while the dataset FD-Datasets is extensive, questions remain regarding its quality and representativeness, particularly in capturing the nuances of LLM responses across different contexts. This could affect the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, as the field of LLMs evolves rapidly, there is a risk that detection methods may soon become obsolete if they do not continuously adapt to new models and architectures. In terms of influence, the paper is likely to resonate with researchers and developers concerned with the ethical use of LLMs and the security of automated systems. The identification of malicious models is particularly relevant as the number of LLM applications continues to rise.  Overall, while the study makes a significant contribution to the field by addressing a clear and pressing need, its reliance on existing models and the potential shortcomings in dataset representation warrant a balanced perspective. **Score: 8**  This score reflects solid novelty and impact within the context of security in LLM utilization but acknowledges potential execution limitations related to model dependency and dataset quality, which could influence practical application and future research avenues.

- **Authors**: Xing Zhang, Jiaheng Wen, Fangkai Yang, Pu Zhao, Yu Kang, Junhao Wang, Maoquan Wang, Yufan Huang, Elsie Nallipogu, Qingwei Lin, Yingnong Dang, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang, Qi Zhang
- **Abstract**: The advancement of large language models has intensified the need to modernize enterprise applications and migrate legacy systems to secure, versatile languages. However, existing code translation benchmarks primarily focus on individual functions, overlooking the complexities involved in translating entire repositories, such as maintaining inter-module coherence and managing dependencies. While some recent repository-level translation benchmarks attempt to address these challenges, they still face limitations, including poor maintainability and overly coarse evaluation granularity, which make them less developer-friendly. We introduce Skeleton-Guided-Translation, a framework for repository-level Java to C# code translation with fine-grained quality evaluation. It uses a two-step process: first translating the repository's structural "skeletons", then translating the full repository guided by these skeletons. Building on this, we present TRANSREPO-BENCH, a benchmark of high quality open-source Java repositories and their corresponding C# skeletons, including matching unit tests and build configurations. Our unit tests are fixed and can be applied across multiple or incremental translations without manual adjustments, enhancing automation and scalability in evaluations. Additionally, we develop fine-grained evaluation metrics that assess translation quality at the individual test case level, addressing traditional binary metrics' inability to distinguish when build failures cause all tests to fail. Evaluations using TRANSREPO-BENCH highlight key challenges and advance more accurate repository level code translation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces "Skeleton-Guided-Translation," a new framework aimed at improving the translation of code repositories, specifically from Java to C#, while addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that focus largely on individual functions. The authors identify limitations in current repository-level benchmarks, such as lack of maintainability and insufficiently detailed evaluations. Their proposed method involves a two-step translation process: initially converting the repository's structural components ("skeletons"), followed by a complete translation guided by these skeletons. They present the TRANSREPO-BENCH, which consists of high-quality open-source Java repositories paired with corresponding C# skeletons, unit tests, and build configurations. This enables superior automation and scalability of evaluations through fixed unit tests that adapt for multiple translations. Additionally, they introduce fine-grained evaluation metrics that analyze translation quality at a detailed level, overcoming the limitations of traditional binary assessment methods. Results showcase the framework's capability to address significant challenges in repository-level code translation. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The paper presents an innovative framework and evaluation benchmarking system that addresses significant gaps in the existing methodologies for code translation. By focusing on repository-level translation instead of isolated functions, it acknowledges the complexities and challenges developers face in real-world applications. The introduction of a two-step translation process and the development of fine-grained evaluation metrics add substantial novelty, especially in terms of offering practical solutions to critical issues in code translation. **Significance:** The significance of this work is marked by its potential impact on enterprise applications and dependency management in code migration projects. As enterprises increasingly adopt advanced programming methodologies, tools that facilitate this transition are highly sought after. The paper contributes valuable insights and methodologies that could lead to improved practices in legacy system modernization. **Strengths:** 1. **Addressing Real-World Challenges:** The focus on repository-level translation and inter-module coherence is highly relevant and filled an observable gap in the existing literature. 2. **Automation and Scalability:** The framework’s emphasis on automated unit tests enables greater scalability for developers and contributes to efficiency in quality evaluation. 3. **Fine-Grained Evaluation Metrics:** These metrics represent a significant advancement over traditional methods, allowing for more nuanced assessments of translation quality. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limitations of Scope:** While the framework targets Java to C# translation, it remains to be seen how well it could adapt to other programming languages or paradigms, potentially limiting broader applicability. 2. **Evaluation of Practical Use Cases:** The paper would benefit from detailed case studies or user feedback that assesses the framework's practicality and effectiveness in various real-world scenarios. 3. **Complexity in Implementation:** The skeleton-guided approach could introduce complexity in implementation compared to simpler translation frameworks, potentially restraining adoption in time-constrained environments. **Conclusion:** Overall, "Skeleton-Guided-Translation" provides a significant contribution to code translation benchmarks, empowering developers with improved methodologies and metrics to facilitate accurate and efficient code migration strategies. The strengths of the innovative framework largely outweigh its weaknesses, affirmatively influencing the field and providing groundwork for future advancements. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16075v1)
- **Authors**: Maxime Louis, Hervé Déjean, Stéphane Clinchant
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents, but they face scalability issues due to high inference costs and limited context size. Document compression is a practical solution, but current soft compression methods suffer from accuracy losses and require extensive pretraining. In this paper, we introduce PISCO, a novel method that achieves a 16x compression rate with minimal accuracy loss (0-3%) across diverse RAG-based question-answering (QA) tasks. Unlike existing approaches, PISCO requires no pretraining or annotated data, relying solely on sequence-level knowledge distillation from document-based questions. With the ability to fine-tune a 7-10B LLM in 48 hours on a single A100 GPU, PISCO offers a highly efficient and scalable solution. We present comprehensive experiments showing that PISCO outperforms existing compression models by 8% in accuracy.

### Using Generative Models to Produce Realistic Populations of UK Windstorms
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16110v1)
- **Authors**: Yee Chun Tsoi, Kieran M. R. Hunt, Len Shaffrey, Atta Badii, Richard Dixon, Ludovico Nicotina
- **Abstract**: This study evaluates the potential of generative models, trained on historical ERA5 reanalysis data, for simulating windstorms over the UK. Four generative models, including a standard GAN, a WGAN-GP, a U-net diffusion model, and a diffusion-GAN were assessed based on their ability to replicate spatial and statistical characteristics of windstorms. Different models have distinct strengths and limitations. The standard GAN displayed broader variability and limited alignment on the PCA dimensions. The WGAN-GP had a more balanced performance but occasionally misrepresented extreme events. The U-net diffusion model produced high-quality spatial patterns but consistently underestimated windstorm intensities. The diffusion-GAN performed better than the other models in general but overestimated extremes. An ensemble approach combining the strengths of these models could potentially improve their overall reliability. This study provides a foundation for such generative models in meteorological research and could potentially be applied in windstorm analysis and risk assessment.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper investigates the effectiveness of various generative models, trained with historical ERA5 reanalysis data, in simulating UK windstorms. It compares four different models: a standard GAN, WGAN-GP, U-net diffusion model, and diffusion-GAN, focusing on their ability to accurately represent both spatial and statistical features of windstorms. Findings suggest that each model has unique strengths; for example, the GAN demonstrated variability but lacked alignment on PCA dimensions, while the WGAN-GP performed reasonably well but struggled with extreme events. The U-net diffusion model excelled in spatial pattern generation but failed to capture windstorm intensities accurately. Conversely, the diffusion-GAN showed overall better performance but overestimated extreme conditions. An ensemble approach that leverages the strengths of the individual models is suggested for enhanced reliability. The paper lays groundwork for utilizing generative models in the context of meteorological research and risk assessment for windstorms. ### Critical Evaluation: The paper presents a significant endeavor to apply state-of-the-art generative modeling techniques to a specific area of meteorological research, which is relatively novel. The use of generative models for simulating extreme weather events such as windstorms holds transformative potential as these models can potentially predict and analyze future climatic conditions based on historical data. This could lead to improved forecasting, risk assessment, and preparedness strategies. Strengths of the paper include: - **Innovative Methodology**: Employing diverse generative models provides a comprehensive framework for comparison and identifies their respective strengths and weaknesses.  - **Substantive Findings**: The results offer insights into which models perform well and under what conditions, contributing to the broader understanding of generative models' applications in meteorology. - **Foundation for Future Research**: The suggestion of using an ensemble approach opens new avenues for integrating multiple models, which is vital for improving predictive reliability. However, there are also notable weaknesses: - **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: While the paper evaluates four models, more depth in analysis of extreme event performances could be beneficial, particularly regarding the implications of misrepresenting such events. - **Data Limitations**: The reliance on historical ERA5 reanalysis data may limit the generalizability of the findings. Examination of a broader range of datasets could strengthen the conclusions made regarding model performance. - **Lack of Real-World Application Discussion**: While the paper introduces the innovative use of generative models, a more explicit discussion on practical applications, such as real-world implementations in storm prediction frameworks, would enhance its impact. Overall, the paper contributes positively to the field, with a focus on an emerging area of research that could prompt further investigations and applications. However, it would benefit from a more extensive exploration of model limitations in real-world scenarios. **Score: 7**  The score reflects a solid contribution that is innovative and potentially impactful, while acknowledging some limitations in scope and practical application. Nonetheless, the foundation laid by this research for future studies in using generative models in meteorological analyses warrants a favorable yet critical evaluation.

### SampleLLM: Optimizing Tabular Data Synthesis in Recommendations
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16125v1)
- **Authors**: Jingtong Gao, Zhaocheng Du, Xiaopeng Li, Xiangyu Zhao, Yichao Wang, Xiangyang Li, Huifeng Guo, Ruiming Tang
- **Abstract**: Tabular data synthesis is crucial in machine learning, yet existing general methods-primarily based on statistical or deep learning models-are highly data-dependent and often fall short in recommender systems. This limitation arises from their difficulty in capturing complex distributions and understanding feature relationships from sparse and limited data, along with their inability to grasp semantic feature relations. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating synthetic data samples through few-shot learning and semantic understanding. However, they often suffer from inconsistent distribution and lack of diversity due to their inherent distribution disparity with the target dataset. To address these challenges and enhance tabular data synthesis for recommendation tasks, we propose a novel two-stage framework named SampleLLM to improve the quality of LLM-based tabular data synthesis for recommendations by ensuring better distribution alignment. In the first stage, SampleLLM employs LLMs with Chain-of-Thought prompts and diverse exemplars to generate data that closely aligns with the target dataset distribution, even when input samples are limited. The second stage uses an advanced feature attribution-based importance sampling method to refine feature relationships within the synthesized data, reducing any distribution biases introduced by the LLM. Experimental results on three recommendation datasets, two general datasets, and online deployment illustrate that SampleLLM significantly surpasses existing methods for recommendation tasks and holds promise for a broader range of tabular data scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper "SampleLLM: Optimizing Tabular Data Synthesis in Recommendations" presents a new framework for generating synthetic tabular data tailored for recommendation tasks. The authors identify limitations of existing methods, particularly their inefficiency in handling sparse data and capturing complex feature relationships. They propose SampleLLM, a two-stage process that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to align generated data distributions with target datasets through Chain-of-Thought prompting and advanced importance sampling. The first stage focuses on generating data that fits the target distribution, while the second stage refines this data to rectify any biases. Experimental results show that SampleLLM outperforms conventional methods across various datasets, demonstrating its potential utility beyond recommendation systems. **Critical Evaluation:** This paper contributes meaningfully to the field of data synthesis for machine learning, particularly in the context of recommendation systems. The novelty lies in leveraging LLMs, which have not seen widespread application in tabular data synthesis, and the introduction of a two-stage framework that addresses specific shortcomings of existing techniques. **Strengths:** 1. **Novel Approach:** The integration of LLMs for synthetic data generation in tabular contexts represents a significant step forward. By utilizing Chain-of-Thought prompts and exemplars, the authors improve alignment with target distributions, a common challenge in the field. 2. **Rigorous Methodology:** The two-stage framework strategically targets both generation and refinement, addressing potential biases that can arise in data synthesis, which is a well-thought-out approach. 3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper presents robust experimental results across multiple datasets, showcasing the method's effectiveness in practical scenarios. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability:** While the results are promising, the framework may require extensive customization to work effectively across different domains outside recommendations. The performance on extremely diverse datasets may not mirror the results showcased. 2. **Complex Implementation:** The approach involves a complex pipeline that may present challenges in implementation and interpretation for practitioners who are not deeply versed in LLMs or feature attribution methods. 3. **Lack of Comparison on Real-world Applications:** Although the paper includes online deployment testing, further exploration of performance in real-world settings and integration with existing systems would enhance its applicability and validation. **Conclusion:** The findings and methodology proposed in this paper have the potential to influence future research on data synthesis, particularly in recommendation systems and tabular data contexts. However, challenges related to generalizability and practicality of implementation temper the impact of the work. **Score: 8**  This score reflects the paper's strong innovative approach and empirical backing, balanced by concerns regarding broader applicability and complexity in real-world use.

### Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16147v1)
- **Authors**: Zhiyuan Lu, Hao Lu, Hua Huang
- **Abstract**: Learning effective deep portrait matting models requires training data of both high quality and large quantity. Neither quality nor quantity can be easily met for portrait matting, however. Since the most accurate ground-truth portrait mattes are acquired in front of the green screen, it is almost impossible to harvest a large-scale portrait matting dataset in reality. This work shows that one can leverage text prompts and the recent Layer Diffusion model to generate high-quality portrait foregrounds and extract latent portrait mattes. However, the portrait mattes cannot be readily in use due to significant generation artifacts. Inspired by the connectivity priors observed in portrait images, that is, the border of portrait foregrounds always appears connected, a connectivity-aware approach is introduced to refine portrait mattes. Building on this, a large-scale portrait matting dataset is created, termed LD-Portrait-20K, with $20,051$ portrait foregrounds and high-quality alpha mattes. Extensive experiments demonstrated the value of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, with models trained on it significantly outperforming those trained on other datasets. In addition, comparisons with the chroma keying algorithm and an ablation study on dataset capacity further confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed matte creation approach. Further, the dataset also contributes to state-of-the-art video portrait matting, implemented by simple video segmentation and a trimap-based image matting model trained on this dataset.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Efficient Portrait Matte Creation With Layer Diffusion and Connectivity Priors" addresses the challenges of acquiring sufficient high-quality training data for deep portrait matting models. The authors highlight the difficulty of obtaining large datasets, particularly as the best ground-truth data is typically collected using green screens. To overcome this limitation, they introduce a method that utilizes text prompts alongside a recent Layer Diffusion model to generate portrait foregrounds and derive latent portrait mattes. However, initial models suffer from generation artifacts, prompting the authors to develop a connectivity-aware approach to refine these mattes based on observed connectivity in portrait images. The authors subsequently created the LD-Portrait-20K dataset, which encompasses 20,051 portrait foregrounds paired with high-quality alpha mattes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that models trained using this dataset outperform those using alternate datasets. The authors also compare their approach with traditional chroma keying methods and conduct an ablation study regarding dataset capacity, validating the effectiveness of their approach. Finally, they indicate that the dataset also advances video portrait matting applications through a straightforward video segmentation and trimap-based image matting model. ### Critical Evaluation: #### Novelty: The paper exhibits significant novelty by introducing a method that leverages both generative techniques and connectivity priors, a combination that is less explored in the context of portrait matting. The creation of the LD-Portrait-20K dataset represents a substantial contribution by providing high-quality training data vital for improving model performance in portrait matting—a topic that suffers from a lack of datasets. Moreover, the connectivity-aware approach to refining generated mattes offers an innovative solution to a common problem in image generation. #### Significance: The significance of this work is underscored by its practical implications in both portrait and video matting applications. By enhancing the quality of generated mattes and creating a large, useful dataset, the authors set a new benchmark for future studies in this field. The demonstrated performance improvements over previous datasets mark a notable advancement in portrait matting methodologies.  #### Strengths: - The proposed methods effectively address a prominent limitation in deep learning for portrait matting—data scarcity. - The LD-Portrait-20K dataset provides a large-scale resource that can foster further research and application in both still and video portrait matting. - Extensive experiments corroborate the efficacy of the proposed techniques, enhancing their credibility in the academic community. #### Weaknesses: - The reliance on generative models may still raise questions regarding the consistency and fidelity of generated images compared to real-world captures. - While the connectivity-aware approach is promising, its effectiveness may vary across different portrait styles or conditions, and such limitations warrant further empirical exploration. - The paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the limitations and potential biases in the generated datasets. #### Conclusion: Overall, the paper introduces a critical advancement in portrait matting, combining innovative approaches to data generation and refinement. While it shows promise and offers significant contributions, it would benefit from clearer discussions on the limitations and implications of its methods in broader contexts. **Score: 8**

### PATCH: Empowering Large Language Model with Programmer-Intent Guidance and Collaborative-Behavior Simulation for Automatic Bug Fixing
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16149v1)
- **Authors**: Yuwei Zhang, Zhi Jin, Ying Xing, Ge Li, Fang Liu, Jiaxin Zhu, Wensheng Dou, Jun Wei
- **Abstract**: Bug fixing holds significant importance in software development and maintenance. Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs. However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor. Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage. To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH. Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches. Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs. We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "PATCH: Empowering Large Language Model with Programmer-Intent Guidance and Collaborative-Behavior Simulation for Automatic Bug Fixing" introduces a novel framework called PATCH aimed at improving the bug-fixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The authors identify a gap in current approaches, which often treat bug resolution as a single-stage task focusing solely on buggy code snippets. Instead, PATCH adopts a stage-wise approach that comprises four key phases: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. This method emphasizes the importance of collaborative behaviors inherent in software development. By enriching the context of the buggy code with dependence and intent information and simulating interactive resolutions between LLMs, PATCH aims to enhance the accuracy of patch generation. The framework leverages the dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT and demonstrates improved performance compared to existing state-of-the-art LLMs through evaluation on the BFP benchmark. ### Critical Evaluation **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Framework**: PATCH introduces a structured, stage-wise framework that addresses the collaborative nature of software bug resolution, which is a significant improvement over traditional methods that treat bug fixing as a singular task. This framework can help emulate human-like reasoning in debugging processes.    2. **Enhanced Input Context**: The focus on augmenting buggy code with relevant context and intent information is a novel approach that likely provides the model with better guidance, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of generated patches. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper reports empirical results that indicate PATCH outperforms existing LLMs on the bug-fixing benchmark BFP, providing a compelling validation of its effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on a Specific LLM**: While utilizing ChatGPT is a strength, the work's reliance on this specific model may limit its generalizability. The performance gains may not be applicable across different LLM architectures or in diverse programming contexts.    2. **Lack of Human Evaluation**: The paper primarily centers on performance metrics; however, it could benefit from qualitative assessments or human evaluations of the generated patches to gauge real-world applicability and effectiveness. 3. **Complexity in Implementation**: The multi-stage approach, while conceptually appealing, may introduce additional complexity in implementation that could deter practical adoption in real-world scenarios. **Novelty and Significance:** The novelty of PATCH lies in its holistic approach to bug fixing by incorporating programmer intent and collaborative behaviors. The framework has the potential to influence how future research is conducted in automated software maintenance and bug resolution. While the paper demonstrates important advancements, the reliance on a specific model and a somewhat narrow focus on quantitative metrics somewhat diminishes its broader applicability. In conclusion, considering the strengths of introducing an innovative framework, effective use of context, and empirical support against existing LLMs but also recognizing the weaknesses related to implementation complexity and model dependency, I would assign a score of **7**. This reflects a commendable contribution to the field with room for further exploration and validation. **Score: 7**

- **Abstract**: Instruction-based computer control agents (CCAs) execute complex action sequences on personal computers or mobile devices to fulfill tasks using the same graphical user interfaces as a human user would, provided instructions in natural language. This review offers a comprehensive overview of the emerging field of instruction-based computer control, examining available agents -- their taxonomy, development, and respective resources -- and emphasizing the shift from manually designed, specialized agents to leveraging foundation models such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We formalize the problem and establish a taxonomy of the field to analyze agents from three perspectives: (a) the environment perspective, analyzing computer environments; (b) the interaction perspective, describing observations spaces (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action spaces (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions, executable code); and (c) the agent perspective, focusing on the core principle of how an agent acts and learns to act. Our framework encompasses both specialized and foundation agents, facilitating their comparative analysis and revealing how prior solutions in specialized agents, such as an environment learning step, can guide the development of more capable foundation agents. Additionally, we review current CCA datasets and CCA evaluation methods and outline the challenges to deploying such agents in a productive setting. In total, we review and classify 86 CCAs and 33 related datasets. By highlighting trends, limitations, and future research directions, this work presents a comprehensive foundation to obtain a broad understanding of the field and push its future development.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper**:  The paper titled "AI Agents for Computer Use: A Review of Instruction-based Computer Control, GUI Automation, and Operator Assistants" presents an extensive review of computer control agents (CCAs) that utilize natural language instructions to perform tasks traditionally executed by human users through graphical user interfaces (GUIs). The authors categorize and analyze these agents based on three perspectives: the environment (different computing contexts), interaction (data representation, input modalities), and agent characteristics (action and learning mechanisms). They highlight the transition from conventional, manually-designed CCAs to those based on foundation models like large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The paper also includes a review of existing datasets and evaluation methods for CCAs, presenting insights into the challenges faced when deploying these agents. The comprehensive classification of 86 CCAs and 33 datasets and the emphasis on future research directions underscore the significance of this work in informing and advancing the field. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance**: **Strengths**: 1. **Comprehensive Taxonomy**: The creation of a structured taxonomy offers a clear framework for classifying CCAs, which has been a significant gap in the literature. This organization allows researchers to better understand the existing landscape and facilitates easier identification of research opportunities.    2. **Bridging Traditional and Modern Approaches**: By contrasting specialized agents with foundation models, the paper tackles the challenges of scalability and generalization in CCAs, emphasizing the importance of integrating AI advancements with practical applications in GUI automation. 3. **Extensive Review**: The inclusion of a detailed analysis of 86 existing CCAs and 33 datasets is particularly beneficial as it compiles a significant amount of information in one place, making it a valuable resource for future researchers. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Limited Practical Applications**: While the paper discusses trends and challenges, it lacks specific case studies or real-world applications of these agents, which could have demonstrated their practical significance beyond theoretical constructs. 2. **Potential Redundancy**: The review covers familiar concepts in AI, which could detract from its novelty. It would benefit from a clearer articulation of how its contributions distinctly advance the state of this field compared with existing reviews. 3. **Evaluation Methods**: Although the authors review current evaluation metrics for CCAs, they do not propose new methods or suggest significant improvements to existing frameworks, which could have strengthened their recommendations for best practices. **Score Justification**: The paper provides substantial insights and a structured overview of a rapidly evolving area in AI, which is crucial for both practitioners and researchers. However, its lack of novel methodologies or in-depth case studies limits its transformative impact on the field. Thus, while it serves as a solid foundation for understanding CCAs, it does not radically alter perspectives or advance techniques to a significant extent.  **Score**: 7

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16153v1)
- **Authors**: Sirui Li, Federica Bragone, Matthieu Barreau, Kateryna Morozovska
- **Abstract**: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful deep learning method capable of providing solutions and parameter estimations of physical systems. Given the complexity of their neural network structure, the convergence speed is still limited compared to numerical methods, mainly when used in applications that model realistic systems. The network initialization follows a random distribution of the initial weights, as in the case of traditional neural networks, which could lead to severe model convergence bottlenecks. To overcome this problem, we follow current studies that deal with optimal initial weights in traditional neural networks. In this paper, we use a convex optimization model to improve the initialization of the weights in PINNs and accelerate convergence. We investigate two optimization models as a first training step, defined as pre-training, one involving only the boundaries and one including physics. The optimization is focused on the first layer of the neural network part of the PINN model, while the other weights are randomly initialized. We test the methods using a practical application of the heat diffusion equation to model the temperature distribution of power transformers. The PINN model with boundary pre-training is the fastest converging method at the current stage.
- **Summary**: **Summary**: The paper presents a method to improve the convergence speed of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving parabolic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) by optimizing the initial weights of the neural network. Traditional PINN approaches typically use random weight initialization, which can lead to slow convergence. To address this issue, the authors propose a convex optimization model focused on initializing the first layer of the neural network, effectively termed "pre-training." They explore two variations of this pre-training: one based solely on boundary conditions and the other integrating physics into the initialization process. The method is tested on the heat diffusion equation, revealing that the boundary pre-training approach yields the fastest convergence among the tested methods. **Evaluation**: The paper presents a noteworthy contribution to the ongoing challenge of convergence in PINNs, particularly in the context of solving parabolic PDEs. The use of a convex optimization model for initializing weights represents a significant departure from conventional approaches, which typically rely on random initialization. This reflects a thoughtful integration of optimization techniques into deep learning, potentially paving the way for similar strategies in other applications within the field of computational physics. **Strengths**: 1. **Novel Approach**: The introduction of convex optimization for weight initialization in PINNs is innovative and addresses a critical limitation—convergence speed. 2. **Clear Practical Application**: The authors effectively demonstrate the utility of their method through a relevant application concerning the heat diffusion equation, which enhances the understanding and significance of their findings. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: By assessing two distinct pre-training strategies, the study provides valuable insights into how boundary and physics-informed approaches affect convergence. **Weaknesses**: 1. **Scope of Evaluation**: The paper predominantly focuses on one type of PDE (the heat diffusion equation). While this is valuable, additional testing on a broader range of PDEs would strengthen the findings and generalizability of their approach. 2. **Limited Discussion on Broader Implications**: While the paper identifies improved convergence as a benefit, it could discuss more explicitly how these methods could be adapted or scaled to various other applications in physics or engineering. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper effectively addresses a significant challenge in the field of PINNs and demonstrates potential for practical applications. While it presents a substantial contribution, the limited scope of the experimental validation narrows its impact. However, the innovation in methodology does position this work as a meaningful advancement in enhancing the computational efficiency of PINNs. **Score: 8**

### AdaCoT: Rethinking Cross-Lingual Factual Reasoning through Adaptive Chain-of-Thought
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16154v1)
- **Authors**: Xin Huang, Tarun Kumar Vangani, Zhengyuan Liu, Bowei Zou, Ai Ti Aw
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive multilingual capabilities through pretraining on diverse corpora. While these models show strong reasoning abilities, their performance varies significantly across languages due to uneven training data distribution. Existing approaches using machine translation, and extensive multilingual pretraining and cross-lingual tuning face scalability challenges and often fail to capture nuanced reasoning processes across languages. In this paper, we introduce AdaCoT (Adaptive Chain-of-Thought), a framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by dynamically routing thought processes through intermediary "thinking languages" before generating target-language responses. AdaCoT leverages a language-agnostic core and incorporates an adaptive, reward-based mechanism for selecting optimal reasoning pathways without requiring additional pretraining. Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates substantial improvements in both factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, with particularly strong performance gains in low-resource language settings. The results suggest that adaptive reasoning paths can effectively bridge the performance gap between high and low-resource languages while maintaining cultural and linguistic nuances.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper titled "AdaCoT: Rethinking Cross-Lingual Factual Reasoning through Adaptive Chain-of-Thought" presents a novel framework named AdaCoT designed to improve the multilingual reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While these models exhibit solid reasoning skills, their effectiveness often varies across different languages due to disparate training data availability. Previous strategies such as machine translation and extensive multilingual tuning face limitations and often do not adequately address nuanced reasoning needs.  AdaCoT introduces a method of dynamic reasoning that utilizes intermediary “thinking languages” to facilitate the thought processes leading to responses in the target language. Central to this technique is a language-agnostic core with an adaptive, reward-based mechanism that selects the most effective reasoning paths without necessitating further pretraining. The authors conduct extensive evaluations against a range of benchmarks, showcasing significant enhancements in factual reasoning quality and cross-lingual consistency, particularly benefiting low-resource languages. The findings indicate that the model can effectively narrow the performance disparities between high-resource and low-resource languages while preserving their unique cultural and linguistic features. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  AdaCoT introduces an innovative approach to multilingual reasoning by utilizing adaptive reasoning pathways through intermediary thinking languages, which stands out from conventional methods relying heavily on direct translations or extensive retraining. This concept is relatively novel compared to existing architectures. However, the notion of using intermediary representations or reasoning steps is not entirely new and has been observed in other contexts related to cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. The careful balancing of engagement with low-resource languages does offer a fresh perspective, although the idea of optimizing thought processes is a broader theme in artificial intelligence. **Significance**: The significance of AdaCoT lies in its potential impact on addressing the underperformance of LLMs in low-resource language contexts. Given the increasing need for multilingual models in global applications, this work could play a vital role in promoting inclusivity in language technology. The emphasis on retaining linguistic and cultural nuances while improving logical reasoning across languages also touches on critical ethical considerations in AI and linguistics. **Strengths**: 1. The adaptive mechanism for selecting reasoning pathways is a strong point that could lead to practical applications in real-world multilingual systems. 2. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks reinforce the claims of enhanced performance. 3. Strong results in low-resource languages address a significant gap in existing research and application. **Weaknesses**: 1. The explanations and justifications for the reward-based adaptive mechanism could be further elucidated, as they are crucial for understanding the practical applicability of AdaCoT. 2. The paper might benefit from more detailed comparisons with a wider array of existing approaches to contextualize its advancements fully. 3. The scalability of the proposed framework in even narrower low-resource situations or dialectal variations could be examined more thoroughly. In conclusion, while the paper presents promising advancements that could significantly affect future deployments of multilingual AI systems, its broader theoretical implications and practical constraints warrant a cautious appraisal of its novelty relative to existing work in the field. **Score**: 7

- **Authors**: Yuwei Zhang, Qingyuan Lu, Kai Liu, Wensheng Dou, Jiaxin Zhu, Li Qian, Chunxi Zhang, Zheng Lin, Jun Wei
- **Abstract**: Unit testing plays a pivotal role in the software development lifecycle, as it ensures code quality. However, writing high-quality unit tests remains a time-consuming task for developers in practice. More recently, the application of large language models (LLMs) in automated unit test generation has demonstrated promising results. Existing approaches primarily focus on interpreted programming languages (e.g., Java), while mature solutions tailored to compiled programming languages like C++ are yet to be explored. The intricate language features of C++, such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions, pose particular challenges for LLMs in generating both executable and high-coverage unit tests. To tackle the aforementioned problems, this paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel LLM-based framework for C++ unit test generation. CITYWALK enhances LLMs by providing a comprehensive understanding of the dependency relationships within the project under test via program analysis. Furthermore, CITYWALK incorporates language-specific knowledge about C++ derived from project documentation and empirical observations, significantly improving the correctness of the LLM-generated unit tests. We implement CITYWALK by employing the widely popular LLM GPT-4o. The experimental results show that CITYWALK outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches on a collection of eight popular C++ projects. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CITYWALK in generating high-quality C++ unit tests.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces CITYWALK, a novel framework designed for enhancing automatic unit test generation in C++ using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4. Unlike existing methods that focus on interpreted languages like Java, CITYWALK addresses the unique challenges posed by C++ features such as pointers, templates, and virtual functions. By analyzing project dependency relationships and leveraging language-specific knowledge from project documentation, CITYWALK improves the correctness and coverage of generated unit tests. Experimental results indicate that CITYWALK outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches across eight popular C++ projects, highlighting its effectiveness in producing high-quality unit tests. **Evaluation:** This paper presents a significant advancement in the use of LLMs for unit testing, particularly targeting C++, a language that offers unique challenges in automated software engineering tasks.  **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty**: The introduction of CITYWALK fills a gap in the research landscape by focusing on C++, which has been largely underrepresented in automated test generation literature. This focus on compiled languages opens up new avenues for using AI in software engineering. 2. **Comprehensive Approach**: By combining program analysis and project-specific knowledge, CITYWALK applies a robust methodology that is likely to yield more accurate and relevant test cases than previous approaches. 3. **Empirical Validation**: The paper offers a detailed experimental evaluation against multiple C++ projects, reinforcing the claims about CITYWALK’s effectiveness and robustness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limitations of Language-Specific Knowledge**: While leveraging language-specific insights is a strength, it may also limit the framework's applicability to other programming paradigms or languages. Future research might need to explore how this framework could adapt to other languages or handle hybrid environments. 2. **Generalization of Results**: The experiments are limited to eight projects, which raises questions about the scalability of the results. More diverse test cases or an expanded dataset would provide a better insight into the framework's performance across different scenarios. 3. **Dependence on LLMs**: The effectiveness of CITYWALK rests on the underlying LLM (GPT-4), and as LLMs evolve, the results may vary. This dependence invites scrutiny about the sustainability of the framework as LLM technology progresses. **Significance**: Overall, CITYWALK represents a meaningful leap forward in automated unit test generation for C++, which is critical for enhancing code quality in real-world applications. The contributions could inspire further research into similar methodologies for other compiled languages and integrate more dynamic approaches to leverage AI in software testing. Based on these considerations, I would assign this paper a **score of 8**. The novelty and empirical validation stand out positively, but there are notable concerns regarding generalizability and dependency, which prevent a perfect score.  **Score: 8**

- **Summary**: **Summary:**   The paper presents MetaDecorator, a user-centric framework designed to enhance virtual tours by enabling the customization of virtual spaces. Utilizing text prompts and image synthesis, MetaDecorator improves static panoramas from 360-degree imaging to create visually engaging environments. This approach enhances the realism and interactivity of virtual experiences when compared to conventional virtual tour offerings. Additionally, the authors explore the incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) and haptic feedback in virtual reality applications to deepen user immersion. **Critical Evaluation:**   The novelty of MetaDecorator lies in its fusion of various technological elements—text-driven prompts, image synthesis, LLMs, and haptic feedback—into a cohesive framework for personalized virtual experiences.

- **Abstract**: While recent advancements have shown remarkable progress in general 3D shape generation models, the challenge of leveraging these approaches to automatically generate wearable 3D assets remains unexplored. To this end, we present BAG, a Body-aligned Asset Generation method to output 3D wearable asset that can be automatically dressed on given 3D human bodies. This is achived by controlling the 3D generation process using human body shape and pose information. Specifically, we first build a general single-image to consistent multiview image diffusion model, and train it on the large Objaverse dataset to achieve diversity and generalizability. Then we train a Controlnet to guide the multiview generator to produce body-aligned multiview images. The control signal utilizes the multiview 2D projections of the target human body, where pixel values represent the XYZ coordinates of the body surface in a canonical space. The body-conditioned multiview diffusion generates body-aligned multiview images, which are then fed into a native 3D diffusion model to produce the 3D shape of the asset. Finally, by recovering the similarity transformation using multiview silhouette supervision and addressing asset-body penetration with physics simulators, the 3D asset can be accurately fitted onto the target human body. Experimental results demonstrate significant advantages over existing methods in terms of image prompt-following capability, shape diversity, and shape quality. Our project page is available at https://bag-3d.github.io/.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper presents BAG (Body-Aligned Asset Generation), a method designed to generate 3D wearable assets that can be automatically fitted onto 3D human bodies. The authors tackle the challenge of 3D shape generation for wearables, which has not been adequately explored in prior works. BAG operates by leveraging body shape and pose data to guide the generation process. Initially, a single-image to multi-view image diffusion model is developed using the Objaverse dataset, ensuring diversity and generalizability. A Controlnet is then trained to produce body-aligned multi-view images from the 2D projections of the target body. This data feeds into a 3D diffusion model to create the final asset shape. The methodology includes recovering transformation details to prevent asset-body penetration through physics simulation, resulting in accurately fitted 3D assets. Experimental results indicate improved capability over existing methods, particularly in image prompt adherence, shape diversity, and quality. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper reveals several notable strengths and potential weaknesses that shape its overall significance in the field: **Strengths:** 1. **Novelty in Application**: The exploration of 3D asset generation specific to wearables is a fresh area of investigation, addressing a significant gap in existing 3D shape generation models which primarily focus on non-wearable shapes. 2. **Comprehensive Methodology**: The use of human body shape and pose to condition the generation process is innovative. This body-alignment approach is a crucial aspect that enhances output relevance to actual human forms. 3. **Utilization of Large Datasets**: Training on the expansive Objaverse dataset should theoretically enhance the model’s performance across different body shapes and styles, which is critical for generating diverse and realistic wearables. 4. **Integration of Physics Simulation**: Addressing penetration through physics is a practical enhancement that adds realism and usability to generated assets, setting it apart from simpler shape generation methods. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependence on Dataset Quality**: The performance directly relies on the quality and diversity of the Objaverse dataset. If the dataset lacks specific styles or types of clothing, this may limit the utility of the BAG model. 2. **Complexity and Computational Costs**: The multifaceted approach involving various models may introduce high computational costs, making it less accessible for developers working with limited resources. 3. **Evaluation Metrics**: While the authors claim significant improvements over existing methods, a deeper analysis with more quantitative results and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods would solidify their claims. **Potential Influence**: The impact of BAG on fields like fashion design, virtual fittings, and gaming can be profound, given the increasing intersection of 3D modeling with augmented reality and virtual try-on technologies. However, the method's reliance on complex processing could hinder widespread adoption among smaller enterprises or individual developers. **Conclusion**: Overall, while BAG addresses a significant challenge in 3D asset generation, some reliance on dataset quality and complexity issues could restrict its immediate applicability. The potential for future research and commercial applications is clear, indicating a promising direction for further explorations in 3D wearable asset generation. **Score: 8**

### SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)
- **Authors**: Wenxuan Xie, Fanpu Cao
- **Abstract**: In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/LancelotXWX/SWIFT.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces SWIFT, a lightweight model designed for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) in resource-constrained environments like edge devices. The model leverages three innovative strategies: (i) wavelet transform for lossless downsampling of time series, (ii) a learnable filter for cross-band information fusion, and (iii) a compact mapping of sub-series using a single shared linear layer or a shallow Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Through comprehensive experiments, SWIFT has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, showcasing its efficiency and efficacy in deployment. Notably, the parameter count of SWIFT-Linear is only 25% compared to a traditional single-layer linear model for time-domain predictions, enhancing its suitability for practical applications. The accompanying code is accessible for further research and implementation. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:** The core novelty in the paper lies in the combination of wavelet decomposition for data downsampling and cross-band information fusion through a learnable filter, which can significantly improve model performance on non-stationary data. The focus on resource efficiency while maintaining accuracy is particularly relevant in today's context where edge computing is increasingly prevalent for time-series forecasting. However, while the techniques employed are interesting, wavelet transformations and MLP mappings are established methodologies within the field. The combination is relatively less common, though not groundbreaking.  **Significance:** The implications of SWIFT are substantial for practitioners in scenarios with limited computational resources. By achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters, the model addresses a critical gap in the literature regarding the scalability of forecasting models on edge devices. The focus on LTSF also broadens the applicability of this research, potentially transforming how industries like finance and IoT handle predictive analytics. **Strengths:** - The approach is well-justified and grounded in existing methodologies while introducing useful innovations. - The paper's experimental validation shows strong results, contributing to its credibility. - Open sourcing the code enhances reproducibility and allows for further exploration by the research community. **Weaknesses:** - The paper may lack depth in comparing against a wider array of lightweight models or more comprehensive baselines, potentially overselling its advantages. - There is limited exploration of the practical limitations and trade-offs in deploying SWIFT in real-world settings beyond computational efficiency. - The novelty of integrating pieces from existing methodologies raises questions about the extent of the incremental advancement. Considering these dimensions, the paper presents a balanced contribution through novel integration of methods while addressing a significant need within the field. However, its reliance on pre-established concepts and the comparative scope limits its impact somewhat. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a strong, but not exceptional, contribution to the field. The work is innovative enough to warrant recognition but does not fundamentally alter existing paradigms or introduce widely new concepts.

### The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16182v1)
- **Authors**: Chuanyang Zheng
- **Abstract**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently taken computer vision by storm. However, the softmax attention underlying ViTs comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering the application of ViTs to high-resolution images. We revisit the attention design and propose a linear attention method to address the limitation, which doesn't sacrifice ViT's core advantage of capturing global representation like existing methods (e.g. local window attention of Swin). We further investigate the key difference between linear attention and softmax attention. Our empirical results suggest that linear attention lacks a fundamental property of concentrating the distribution of the attention matrix. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a local concentration module to enhance linear attention. By incorporating enhanced linear global attention and local window attention, we propose a new ViT architecture, dubbed L$^2$ViT. Notably, L$^2$ViT can effectively capture both global interactions and local representations while enjoying linear computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong performance of L$^2$ViT. On image classification, L$^2$ViT achieves 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any extra training data or label. By further pre-training on ImageNet-22k, it attains 87.0% when fine-tuned with resolution 384$^2$. For downstream tasks, L$^2$ViT delivers favorable performance as a backbone on object detection as well as semantic segmentation.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper titled "The Linear Attention Resurrection in Vision Transformer" addresses the limitations posed by the softmax attention mechanism in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which suffers from quadratic time and memory complexity, making it less feasible for high-resolution images. The authors propose a new linear attention method that maintains the Fähigkeit of ViTs to capture global representations without the computational inefficiencies of traditional methods like Swin’s local window attention. They identify that linear attention misses a key feature of softmax attention—the concentration of the attention matrix distribution. To remedy this, they introduce a local concentration module, resulting in a novel architecture known as L²ViT. This architecture effectively integrates both linear global attention and local window attention, achieving linear computational complexity while excelling in performance. The experiments demonstrate that L²ViT achieves an impressive 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without additional training data and 87.0% with further pre-training. Additionally, L²ViT shows strong performance in downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. ### Rigorous Evaluation **Novelty and Significance:** The paper offers a significant advancement in the field of computer vision by addressing a critical limitation of ViTs, specifically their computational inefficiency with high-resolution data. The formulation of a local concentration module to enhance linear attention represents a noteworthy innovation, as it directly tackles the observed shortcoming of linear attention lacking attention concentration, a fundamental property that contributes to effective visual representation. The introduction of the L²ViT architecture is particularly noteworthy, as it promises to bridge the gap between global and local attention mechanisms while retaining linear complexity. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation in Design**: The creation of a local concentration module enhances the previously developed linear attention mechanisms, which is a novel contribution to the body of knowledge. 2. **Performance Metrics**: Demonstrating high accuracy on ImageNet-1K indicates robust empirical validation of the proposed architecture, making it a compelling model for both classification and downstream tasks. 3. **Broader Applicability**: The model’s capability to efficiently process high-resolution images expands the practical applications of ViTs in various computer vision tasks. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Comparative Analysis**: While the authors provide empirical results, the paper could benefit from a more thorough exploration of comparisons with various existing attention mechanisms beyond just Swin, particularly in diverse contexts and datasets. 2. **Conceptual Clarifications**: The explanation of how linear attention fails to concentrate attention as effectively as softmax could be unpacked further, providing deeper insights into the theoretical implications of this observation. **Conclusion:** The paper presents a meaningful contribution to the field of computer vision through its innovative approach to linear attention in ViTs. By enhancing the attention mechanism while maintaining computational efficiency, it sets a foundation for future research into more scalable ViT architectures. While some aspects could be examined in greater detail, the overall impact and relevance to current challenges in the field are clear. **Score: 8**

### Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16191v1)
- **Authors**: Antony Bartlett, Cynthia Liem, Annibale Panichella
- **Abstract**: Fixing Python dependency issues is a tedious and error-prone task for developers, who must manually identify and resolve environment dependencies and version constraints of third-party modules and Python interpreters. Researchers have attempted to automate this process by relying on large knowledge graphs and database lookup tables. However, these traditional approaches face limitations due to the variety of dependency error types, large sets of possible module versions, and conflicts among transitive dependencies. This study explores the potential of using large language models (LLMs) to automatically fix dependency issues in Python programs. We introduce PLLM (pronounced "plum"), a novel technique that employs retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help an LLM infer Python versions and required modules for a given Python file. PLLM builds a testing environment that iteratively (1) prompts the LLM for module combinations, (2) tests the suggested changes, and (3) provides feedback (error messages) to the LLM to refine the fix. This feedback cycle leverages natural language processing (NLP) to intelligently parse and interpret build error messages. We benchmark PLLM on the Gistable HG2.9K dataset, a collection of challenging single-file Python gists. We compare PLLM against two state-of-the-art automatic dependency inference approaches, namely PyEGo and ReadPyE, w.r.t. the ability to resolve dependency issues. Our results indicate that PLLM can fix more dependency issues than the two baselines, with +218 (+15.97%) more fixes over ReadPyE and +281 (+21.58%) over PyEGo. Our deeper analyses suggest that PLLM is particularly beneficial for projects with many dependencies and for specific third-party numerical and machine-learning modules. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-based approaches to iteratively resolve Python dependency issues.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "Raiders of the Lost Dependency: Fixing Dependency Conflicts in Python using LLMs" addresses the challenges developers face when fixing dependency issues in Python. Traditional automation methods relying on knowledge graphs and database lookups fall short due to the complexity and variety of dependency errors. The authors introduce a novel technique called PLLM (pronounced "plum"), which leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to help a large language model (LLM) automatically resolve these issues. PLLM creates a testing environment that iteratively engages with the LLM to suggest module combinations, test them, and refine the suggestions based on error messages identified during testing. The technique was benchmarked against two leading automatic dependency resolution methods, PyEGo and ReadPyE, using the Gistable HG2.9K dataset. Results show that PLLM can fix significantly more dependency issues than the other approaches, indicating its potential, especially for projects with complex dependencies and those utilizing popular numerical and machine-learning libraries. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper offers a fresh approach to an enduring problem in software engineering—the resolution of dependency conflicts in Python. By utilizing LLMs for dependency inference, the work deviates from traditional static analysis and knowledge graph approaches. The introduction of the PLLM technique, in particular, represents a meaningful advancement, as it combines retrieval-augmented generation and a feedback mechanism from build errors to iteratively improve suggestion accuracy. **Strengths:** - **Use of LLMs:** The application of LLMs to infer module requirements is innovative, capitalizing on advancements in natural language processing. - **Empirical Evaluation:** The authors conducted rigorous benchmarking against two prominent alternatives, demonstrating substantial improvements in the ability to resolve dependency issues quantitatively. - **Iterative Improvement with RAG:** The use of feedback loops to refine suggestions based on real-time error messages is a sophisticated method that enhances the model's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** - **Scope and Generalization:** The evaluation is limited to a specific dataset (Gistable HG2.9K), and it is unclear how PLLM performs across a broader array of Python projects or with real-world applications that might have different types of dependencies. - **Complexity in Use:** While automation is a key goal, the iterative testing approach may introduce delays in environments where immediate fixes are needed. **Impact on the Field:** The implications of this research are significant, as dependency resolution often hinders software development efficiency. If circulated widely and adopted in development environments, PLLM could vastly improve developer productivity and reduce the frustration associated with dependency management. However, the cautious interpretation of results due to potential dataset bias calls for further validation in diverse coding scenarios. ### Final Score: Considering the novelty, methodology, empirical support, and potential impact, I assign the paper a score of **8**. Although it offers a commendable contribution to the automated resolution of dependency issues, the limited scope of evaluation and the practical implementation concerns temper its overall significance.  **Score: 8**

- **Abstract**: Activities in underwater environments are paramount in several scenarios, which drives the continuous development of underwater image enhancement techniques. A major challenge in this domain is the depth at which images are captured, with increasing depth resulting in a darker environment. Most existing methods for underwater image enhancement focus on noise removal and color adjustment, with few works dedicated to brightness enhancement. This work introduces a novel unsupervised learning approach to underwater image enhancement using a diffusion model. Our method, called UDBE, is based on conditional diffusion to maintain the brightness details of the unpaired input images. The input image is combined with a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation map (SNR) to ensure stable training and prevent color distortion in the output images. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves an impressive accuracy rate in the datasets UIEB, SUIM and RUIE, well-established underwater image benchmarks. Additionally, the experiments validate the robustness of our approach, regarding the image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, and UISM, indicating the good performance of the brightness enhancement process. The source code is available here: https://github.com/gusanagy/UDBE.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "UDBE: Unsupervised Diffusion-based Brightness Enhancement in Underwater Images" presents an innovative technique for enhancing the brightness of underwater images, which typically suffer from challenges such as reduced visibility with increasing depth. Unlike most existing methods that focus on noise removal and color adjustments, this work emphasizes brightness enhancement through a novel unsupervised learning approach utilizing a conditional diffusion model. The method incorporates a color map and a Signal-Noise Relation (SNR) map to maintain detail and prevent color distortion during training. The effectiveness of UDBE is demonstrated through its performance on established benchmarks (UIEB, SUIM, and RUIE) and is evaluated using multiple image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, UIQM, UISM), indicating strong robustness and performance in brightness enhancement. ### Critical Evaluation: #### Strengths: 1. **Novelty in Approach**: The method's focus on unsupervised brightness enhancement using a diffusion model is relatively unique in the domain. The integration of conditional diffusion to preserve brightness detail is a noteworthy advancement over conventional methods. 2. **Thorough Benchmarking**: The evaluation against well-established datasets underscores the reliability of the results. The authors provide detailed comparisons using commonly accepted image quality metrics, enhancing the credibility of their findings. 3. **Potential Impact**: Given the increasing significance of underwater imaging in various fields (like marine research, underwater robotics, and environmental monitoring), improving brightness could have broader implications for enhancing visibility in challenging environments. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Limited Scope**: While the paper addresses brightness enhancement, it does not comprehensively tackle other critical factors affecting underwater images, such as color balance or distortion due to varying water conditions. This might limit its applicability in more complex scenarios. 2. **Unsupplied Code Details**: Although source code availability is mentioned, the paper would benefit from further elaboration on how to implement the method, including any prerequisites or specific hardware requirements, which might restrict accessibility for some potential users. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could further strengthen its case by comparing UDBE not just with related methods in brightness enhancement but also with comprehensive image enhancement techniques that integrate multiple aspects beyond brightness adjustment. ### Conclusion: The UDBE paper represents a meaningful contribution to the niche field of underwater image processing, particularly with its innovative focus on unsupervised brightness enhancement through a diffusion-based methodology. However, its limited scope and a somewhat technical presentation might restrain its immediate applicability. In light of these factors, I assign a score of **Score: 7**. This reflects a strong contribution with considerable potential, combined with room for further exploration and integration of additional enhancement techniques in future work.

### Provence: efficient and robust context pruning for retrieval-augmented generation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16214v1)
- **Authors**: Nadezhda Chirkova, Thibault Formal, Vassilina Nikoulina, Stéphane Clinchant
- **Abstract**: Retrieval-augmented generation improves various aspects of large language models (LLMs) generation, but suffers from computational overhead caused by long contexts as well as the propagation of irrelevant retrieved information into generated responses. Context pruning deals with both aspects, by removing irrelevant parts of retrieved contexts before LLM generation. Existing context pruning approaches are however limited, and do not provide a universal model that would be both efficient and robust in a wide range of scenarios, e.g., when contexts contain a variable amount of relevant information or vary in length, or when evaluated on various domains. In this work, we close this gap and introduce Provence (Pruning and Reranking Of retrieVEd relevaNt ContExts), an efficient and robust context pruner for Question Answering, which dynamically detects the needed amount of pruning for a given context and can be used out-of-the-box for various domains. The three key ingredients of Provence are formulating the context pruning task as sequence labeling, unifying context pruning capabilities with context reranking, and training on diverse data. Our experimental results show that Provence enables context pruning with negligible to no drop in performance, in various domains and settings, at almost no cost in a standard RAG pipeline. We also conduct a deeper analysis alongside various ablations to provide insights into training context pruners for future work.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Provence: efficient and robust context pruning for retrieval-augmented generation" addresses the challenges associated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the computational overhead from long contexts and the incorporation of irrelevant information into outputs. The authors propose "Provence," a context pruning framework designed to dynamically identify and remove non-relevant parts from retrieved contexts for optimized Question Answering. This framework comprises three main components: treating the pruning task as sequence labeling, integrating pruning with context reranking, and training on a diverse dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that Provence maintains performance across various domains while significantly reducing computational costs. The paper also includes an analysis and various ablations to support future training methodologies for context pruners. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the paper lies in its synthesis of context pruning and reranking as well as the introduction of a method that adapts dynamically to varying input contexts. By framing context pruning as a sequence labeling task, it distinguishes itself from previous methods that often took a static approach. This innovative perspective can be beneficial in promoting more adaptive models which are critical given the varied nature of inputs in real-world applications of LLMs. The significance of Provence is particularly noted in its practical applicability across multiple domains, addressing a critical need for efficiency in RAG pipelines. The authors provide compelling evidence of Provence's effectiveness through extensive experimentation, presenting results that indicate negligible performance drops, an important consideration for practitioners in the field. Furthermore, the inclusion of a deeper analysis and ablation studies strengthens the paper by giving insight into how the framework can be tailored or improved for specific tasks. However, while Provence is undoubtedly beneficial, the paper could further discuss potential limitations or scenarios where pruning might lead to loss of crucial information, thereby compromising the quality of generated responses. Additionally, the authors could explore the broader implications of their methodology in more diverse and complex real-world scenarios rather than focusing on managed datasets. Overall, the paper contributes substantially to the current landscape of retrieval-augmented generation by providing a robust solution to existing limitations of contextual processing in LLMs. Its integration of pruning and reranking offers a unique approach that is likely to influence future developments in this area. **Score: 8**  The score reflects the paper's innovative approach and practical significance in enhancing LLM efficiency through context pruning, while acknowledging the need for further exploration of its limitations in complex scenarios.

### Enhancing Visual Inspection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models on Medical Time Series with Supportive Conformalized and Interpretable Small Specialized Models
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16215v1)
- **Authors**: Huayu Li, Xiwen Chen, Ci Zhang, Stuart F. Quan, William D. S. Killgore, Shu-Fen Wung, Chen X. Chen, Geng Yuan, Jin Lu, Ao Li
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities in visual inspection of medical time-series data, achieving proficiency comparable to human clinicians. However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper introduces ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support model designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in visual inspection tasks specific to medical time-series data, like arrhythmia detection and sleep staging. While LLMs have shown impressive results comparable to human clinicians, their broad application limits accuracy in specialized medical domains, and the proprietary nature of their weights prevents finer adjustments for specific tasks. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) achieve high precision in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning that complex clinical decisions require. ConMIL addresses these limitations by utilizing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to pinpoint clinically relevant segments in time-series data, combined with conformal prediction for producing calibrated outputs that improve interpretability. Experimental results indicate that integrating ConMIL significantly boosts the performance of existing LLMs, exemplified by the Qwen2-VL-7B model showing substantial gains in accuracy for specific clinical tasks. --- ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Innovation**: The integration of SSMs with LLMs via ConMIL is a notable innovation, as it effectively combines the strengths of both model types—contextual reasoning from LLMs and precision from SSMs. 2. **Contribution to Medical AI**: By focusing on enhancing interpretability and contextual reasoning in medical time-series analysis, the work is relevant to both AI research and the healthcare field, where decision support is critical. 3. **Quantitative Improvements**: The reported performance gains (from 46.13% to 94.92% in arrhythmia detection, for instance) are substantial, indicating that the method has practical applicability and might significantly aid clinicians. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Generalizability**: While the results are impressive, the paper does not sufficiently address whether the findings can be generalized across diverse medical datasets beyond those tested. 2. **Complexity**: The proposed model, although innovative, introduces additional complexity that may be a barrier for clinical adoption. The integration of two model types could complicate training and implementation in real-world settings. 3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper predominantly focuses on comparing ConMIL with specific LLMs but does not address how it compares to other emerging methods in the field of medical AI or decision support systems. **Conclusion**: Overall, the paper presents a valuable approach that bridges the gap between state-of-the-art LLM capabilities and the precision required for specific medical tasks. However, its generalizability and practical complexity could be points of concern for its widespread adoption in clinical practice.  **Score: 8**  This score reflects a strong contribution to the field of medical AI, particularly for its innovative integration of models aimed at improving clinical decision-making accuracy and interpretability. However, reservations about generalizability and practical implementation prevent it from reaching a perfect score.

- **Authors**: Abdoulatif Cissé, Xenophon Evangelopoulos, Vladimir V. Gusev, Andrew I. Cooper
- **Abstract**: Many important scientific problems involve multivariate optimization coupled with slow and laborious experimental measurements. These complex, high-dimensional searches can be defined by non-convex optimization landscapes that resemble needle-in-a-haystack surfaces, leading to entrapment in local minima. Contextualizing optimizers with human domain knowledge is a powerful approach to guide searches to localized fruitful regions. However, this approach is susceptible to human confirmation bias and it is also challenging for domain experts to keep track of the rapidly expanding scientific literature. Here, we propose the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextualizing Bayesian optimization (BO) via a hybrid optimization framework that intelligently and economically blends stochastic inference with domain knowledge-based insights from the LLM, which is used to suggest new, better-performing areas of the search space for exploration. Our method fosters user engagement by offering real-time commentary on the optimization progress, explaining the reasoning behind the search strategies. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic benchmarks with up to 15 independent variables and demonstrate the ability of LLMs to reason in four real-world experimental tasks where context-aware suggestions boost optimization performance substantially.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper The paper presents a novel approach called BORA (Language-Based Bayesian Optimization Research Assistant) that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Bayesian optimization to enhance multivariate optimization tasks. The authors address the common challenges associated with optimization in complex, high-dimensional spaces, which often lead to local minima. BORA leverages domain knowledge from LLMs to guide experimental searches, aiming to mitigate human biases and streamline the optimization process. The method involves real-time feedback and explanations of the optimization strategies, thus enhancing user interaction and understanding. The effectiveness of BORA is validated through synthetic benchmarks and real-world experimental tasks, showcasing improvements in optimization performance through context-aware suggestions. ### Critical Evaluation **Novelty**:  The integration of LLMs into Bayesian optimization represents an innovative intersection between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and domain-specific problem-solving. The concept of utilizing language models to inform and improve optimization strategies is relatively new, especially in the context of scientific research where experimental measurements are resource-intensive. This dual approach—employing stochastic methods alongside human-like reasoning—stands out against traditional optimization techniques that often overlook contextual knowledge. **Significance**:  The significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize how researchers approach optimization problems in scientific fields. By utilizing LLMs, BORA addresses the critical challenge of local minima entrapment and enhances the ability of researchers to navigate vast and rapidly expanding literature. The method's design to provide real-time commentary also adds educational and practical value to the optimization process, potentially improving the overall efficiency and outcomes of experimental research. **Strengths**: - **Integration of LLMs**: A fresh approach that enhances optimization with contextual awareness. - **User Engagement**: The feature providing real-time feedback and explanations is notable for improving research workflows. - **Validation**: The use of synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the method.    **Weaknesses**: - **Scalability**: The paper does not extensively address how the approach scales with even larger and more complex datasets or in high-dimensional settings beyond 15 variables. - **Assumptions on LLM Performance**: There might be inherent limitations or biases in LLMs that could affect the optimization results, which the authors do not deeply explore. - **Human Factors**: While the method addresses human biases to some degree, the reliance on human interaction may still introduce errors, particularly if the researcher does not interpret LLM suggestions effectively. ### Conclusion Overall, the paper provides a significant contribution to the field of optimization and applies contemporary techniques in a novel context. It has practical implications that could lead to enhanced efficiencies in scientific research, making it noteworthy. However, more detail about scalability and limitations could have strengthened the work further. **Score: 8**

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16227v1)
- **Authors**: Omar Elharrouss, Younes Akbari, Noor Almaadeed, Somaya Al-Maadeed, Fouad Khelifi, Ahmed Bouridane
- **Abstract**: Source camera identification has emerged as a vital solution to unlock incidents involving critical cases like terrorism, violence, and other criminal activities. The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper titled "PDC-ViT: Source Camera Identification using Pixel Difference Convolution and Vision Transformer" addresses the critical issue of identifying the source cameras used to capture images and videos, which can be crucial in criminal investigations. The authors propose a novel method combining Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. The PDC utilizes two techniques—Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC)—to enhance feature extraction by capturing subtle pixel variations that differentiate source cameras. In the classification stage, the method innovatively feeds PDC features into the ViT rather than directly using image patches. The evaluation of the PDC-ViT method across five datasets shows improved accuracy and robustness over existing methods, reporting accuracies of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22%, and 92.29% on different datasets, indicating a promising advancement in the domain of source camera identification. ### Critical Evaluation: #### Novelty: The integration of Pixel Difference Convolution with Vision Transformer presents a novel approach in the field of source camera identification, which has traditionally relied on less sophisticated feature extraction techniques. This unique combination of methods suggests an innovative direction for enhancing accuracy in identifying the origin of media, which is critical in forensic analysis. The exploration of PDC, particularly its sub-techniques like APDC and RPDC, adds further innovation by focusing on pixel-level differences that are often overlooked in broader image features. #### Strengths: 1. **Technical Innovation**: The paper presents a well-defined framework that merges two advanced techniques—PDC and ViT—demonstrating originality in the approach to feature extraction and classification. 2. **Robust Experimental Results**: The reported results show a clear performance improvement over existing methods, backed by evaluations on multiple diverse datasets, which enhances the credibility of the claims. 3. **Relevance**: The subject matter is timely and relevant, addressing a significant need in law enforcement for reliable source camera identification, thus having potential societal impacts. #### Weaknesses: 1. **Generalizability**: While the method performs well on the datasets used, the paper lacks comprehensive testing on other datasets or real-world scenarios. The effectiveness in more varied conditions remains to be examined. 2. **Comparative Analysis**: A detailed comparative analysis of the proposed method against a wider range of existing methods would strengthen the claims of superiority and provide deeper insights into specific advantages of the proposed approach. 3. **Complexity of Implementation**: The combination of techniques may introduce complexities that could affect practical implementation in real-world settings, particularly in terms of computational requirements. #### Potential Influence: The findings have the potential to influence developments in digital forensics and law enforcement practices significantly, as enhanced source camera identification aids investigations and can bolster evidence integrity. However, further research is needed to validate the approach under practical conditions. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of **7**. This score reflects solid novelty and potential impact due to its innovative approach and significant results, tempered by some reservations regarding generalizability and detailed comparative analyses. The PDC-ViT method stands out in advancing the field, but further validation is essential for broader acceptance and application. **Score: 7**

### Phase Transitions in Large Language Models and the $O(N)$ Model
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16241v1)
- **Authors**: Youran Sun, Babak Haghighat
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit unprecedentedly rich scaling behaviors. In physics, scaling behavior is closely related to phase transitions, critical phenomena, and field theory. To investigate the phase transition phenomena in LLMs, we reformulated the Transformer architecture as an $O(N)$ model. Our study reveals two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the temperature used in text generation and the model's parameter size, respectively. The first phase transition enables us to estimate the internal dimension of the model, while the second phase transition is of \textit{higher-depth} and signals the emergence of new capabilities. As an application, the energy of the $O(N)$ model can be used to evaluate whether an LLM's parameters are sufficient to learn the training data.
- **Summary**: ### Summary of the Paper: The paper investigates the scaling behaviors of large language models (LLMs) through the lens of physics, specifically using concepts from phase transitions and the field theory model known as the $O(N)$ model. The authors reformulate the Transformer architecture within this framework to explore two significant phase transitions. The first transition relates to the temperature during text generation processes, allowing for the estimation of the model’s internal dimensionality. The second transition, identified as a higher-order transition, suggests the emergence of advanced capabilities as model parameters increase. Additionally, the energy metrics from the $O(N)$ model provide insights into whether the parameters of an LLM are adequate for learning from the training data. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance: **Strengths:** 1. **Interdisciplinary Approach:** The paper effectively bridges the fields of machine learning and theoretical physics, opening avenues for innovative analyses of LLMs using established physical concepts. 2. **Foundational Insights:** The identification of two distinct phase transitions offers new perspectives on how LLMs scale with parameter size and text generation temperatures, contributing valuable theoretical foundations for understanding model behaviors. 3. **Implications for Design:** By relating model energy to learning sufficiency, the paper offers practical implications for researchers and practitioners in optimizing LLM architectures. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Theoretical Rigor:** While the transition identification is novel, the paper may lack detailed mathematical rigor in establishing the connections between the $O(N)$ model and real-world LLM behaviors. More empirical validation could enhance the credibility of the claims. 2. **Generalizability of Findings:** The analysis primarily focuses on the Transformer architecture; it remains unclear how widely applicable these insights may be across different architectures or applications beyond LLMs. 3. **Limited Practical Applications:** Although the discussions around phase transitions are intriguing, the immediate applicability of the findings might be limited for practitioners, who typically seek actionable insights rather than theoretical frameworks. **Overall Assessment:** This paper contributes notably to the theoretical understanding of LLMs by applying concepts from physics, illustrating significant findings regarding phase transitions and potential applications in model design evaluation. However, the limitations in theoretical rigor and practical application suggest that while the contributions are meaningful, they may not fully resonate or impact the field as widely as more actionable research outcomes. ### Score: 7 This score reflects the paper's innovative approach and valuable theoretical insights but acknowledges the need for more rigorous validation and broader applicability in practical contexts within the machine learning community.

- **Authors**: Lucas Carrasco, Felipe Urrutia, Andrés Abeliuk
- **Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel algorithm for constructing decision trees using large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner based on Classification and Regression Trees (CART) principles. Traditional decision tree induction methods rely heavily on labeled data to recursively partition data using criteria such as information gain or the Gini index. In contrast, we propose a method that uses the pre-trained knowledge embedded in LLMs to build decision trees without requiring training data. Our approach leverages LLMs to perform operations essential for decision tree construction, including attribute discretization, probability calculation, and Gini index computation based on the probabilities. We show that these zero-shot decision trees can outperform baseline zero-shot methods and achieve competitive performance compared to supervised data-driven decision trees on tabular datasets. The decision trees constructed via this method provide transparent and interpretable models, addressing data scarcity while preserving interpretability. This work establishes a new baseline in low-data machine learning, offering a principled, knowledge-driven alternative to data-driven tree construction.

- **Abstract**: We present GeoLLM-Squad, a geospatial Copilot that introduces the novel multi-agent paradigm to remote sensing (RS) workflows. Unlike existing single-agent approaches that rely on monolithic large language models (LLM), GeoLLM-Squad separates agentic orchestration from geospatial task-solving, by delegating RS tasks to specialized sub-agents.

- **Abstract**: Systematic literature review is essential for evidence-based medicine, requiring comprehensive analysis of clinical trial publications. However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical literature mining has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation across broad therapeutic areas and diverse tasks. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model for study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature. The model is trained on 633,759 instruction data points in LEADSInstruct, curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. We showed that LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge generic large language models (LLMs) on six tasks. Furthermore, LEADS enhances expert workflows by providing supportive references following expert requests, streamlining processes while maintaining high-quality results. A study with 16 clinicians and medical researchers from 14 different institutions revealed that experts collaborating with LEADS achieved a recall of 0.81 compared to 0.77 experts working alone in study selection, with a time savings of 22.6%. In data extraction tasks, experts using LEADS achieved an accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.80 without using LEADS, alongside a 26.9% time savings. These findings highlight the potential of specialized medical literature foundation models to outperform generic models, delivering significant quality and efficiency benefits when integrated into expert workflows for medical literature mining.

- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16276v1)
- **Authors**: Long Nguyen, Tho Quan
- **Abstract**: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex, specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment. Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house, lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models. Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper introduces the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, designed to improve the precision of answers provided by university admission chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It acknowledges the challenges in deploying enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, which typically involve high operational costs and complex training processes, leading to difficulties in providing accurate information in educational contexts. URAG aims to overcome these challenges by optimizing the performance of a lightweight model, allowing it to generate responses that are comparable to state-of-the-art commercial models. The effectiveness of URAG is supported by experimental results, and a case study conducted at HCMUT demonstrates its practical applicability and positive reception within the educational sector. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper makes a noteworthy contribution to the intersection of AI, Natural Language Processing, and education. Its primary strength lies in addressing the operational challenges associated with implementing RAG in university admission chatbots. By proposing a hybrid URAG Framework, the authors offer a promising solution to enhance accuracy without the accompanying complexities and costs often associated with existing state-of-the-art methods. However, the paper's novelty could be tempered by the fact that the foundational elements of RAG have been previously explored in other contexts, and while the hybrid approach is intriguing, the specific contribution to educational chatbots may not wholly encapsulate an innovative paradigm shift. A more thorough differentiation from prior works could enhance the impact of the findings. Moreover, the case study provides a practical validation, but additional metrics concerning user experience, scalability, and adaptability across different institutions would bolster its claims regarding generalizability and effectiveness. Without comprehensive data on these aspects, it is difficult to assess the framework's robustness. In terms of significance, while the findings are valuable for researchers developing chatbots, the practical influence of this work could face constraints due to the specificity of its application. The paper's reliance on positive feedback does not substitute for rigorous quantitative validation. Overall, the paper presents relevant insights that could pave the way for future research and applications in educational AI systems but could benefit from deeper analytical grounding and broader applicability.  **Score: 7**

### Do LLMs Have Visualization Literacy? An Evaluation on Modified Visualizations to Test Generalization in Data Interpretation
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16277v1)
- **Authors**: Jiayi Hong, Christian Seto, Arlen Fan, Ross Maciejewski
- **Abstract**: In this paper, we assess the visualization literacy of two prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): OpenAI's Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), the backend of ChatGPT, and Google's Gemini, previously known as Bard, to establish benchmarks for assessing their visualization capabilities. While LLMs have shown promise in generating chart descriptions, captions, and design suggestions, their potential for evaluating visualizations remains under-explored. Collecting data from humans for evaluations has been a bottleneck for visualization research in terms of both time and money, and if LLMs were able to serve, even in some limited role, as evaluators, they could be a significant resource. To investigate the feasibility of using LLMs in the visualization evaluation process, we explore the extent to which LLMs possess visualization literacy -- a crucial factor for their effective utility in the field. We conducted a series of experiments using a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT) for GPT-4 and Gemini. Our findings indicate that the LLMs we explored currently fail to achieve the same levels of visualization literacy when compared to data from the general public reported in VLAT, and LLMs heavily relied on their pre-existing knowledge to answer questions instead of utilizing the information provided by the visualization when answering questions.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper investigates the visualization literacy of two leading Large Language Models (LLMs), OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini, through a modified 53-item Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT). Despite their ability to generate descriptions and suggestions for visualizations, the study finds that these LLMs do not exhibit comparable levels of visualization literacy to the general public. Specifically, the models often relied on pre-existing knowledge rather than the information from the visualizations when answering questions. This research highlights the potential of LLMs in visualization evaluation and identifies significant limitations that hinder their effectiveness as evaluative tools in this domain. ### Evaluation The paper presents novel research by addressing a relatively unexplored area concerning the capabilities of LLMs in evaluating and interpreting visualizations. This is significant in the context of visualization research, where human data evaluation has been a bottleneck due to logistical challenges. The authors conducted rigorous experiments, providing insights into the current limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs. The paper is well-structured, detailing methodology and findings comprehensively. However, several weaknesses dampen its impact. Firstly, the study does not delve deeply enough into potential reasons for the LLMs' reliance on pre-existing knowledge, which would be beneficial for further research. Secondly, the sample size and diversity for the VLAT should be scrutinized; more context on the comparison with human performance may yield deeper insights. Lastly, while the paper touches on the implications for future research, it lacks concrete recommendations on how LLMs could be improved for better visualization literacy or how they could be integrated into visualization studies effectively. Overall, the study opens up valuable discussions and lays the groundwork for future explorations into LLM capabilities in visualization, but it also demonstrates the limitations inherent in current LLM technology. This combination of novelty and limitation justifies a moderately high but not exceptional score. Score: 7

- **Abstract**: Understanding brain disorders is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** The paper titled "Brain-Adapter: Enhancing Neurological Disorder Analysis with Adapter-Tuning Multimodal Large Language Models" introduces a novel method—Brain-Adapter—that improves the analysis of brain disorders by effectively leveraging multimodal data from both medical images and text descriptions. Unlike previous studies that focused primarily on 2D images and single-modality methods, Brain-Adapter employs a lightweight bottleneck layer for adapter-tuning, allowing it to learn and integrate new knowledge with minimal additional parameters. The method utilizes a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align various modalities into a cohesive representation. The experiments demonstrated significant enhancements in diagnostic accuracy while maintaining low computational costs, which indicates its potential application in clinical settings. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper contributes notably to the current discourse in the field of neurological disorder analysis by addressing the underutilization of 3D medical imaging and the benefits of combining multiple data modalities—text and images. This dual approach is particularly important in medical contexts where comprehensive analysis often leads to better clinical outcomes. Strengths: 1. **Novelty of Approach:** The introduction of the brain-adapter using a lightweight bottleneck layer presents a significant innovation in adapting pre-trained models for specific medical tasks without requiring extensive computational resources. 2. **Practical Relevance:** By demonstrating improvements in diagnosis accuracy, the proposed method could facilitate better clinical workflows, making it highly relevant for practitioners. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The extensive experiments highlight the robustness of the method, although details on the dataset and metrics used would strengthen this aspect.

### Mixture-of-Mamba: Enhancing Multi-Modal State-Space Models with Modality-Aware Sparsity
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16295v1)
- **Authors**: Weixin Liang, Junhong Shen, Genghan Zhang, Ning Dong, Luke Zettlemoyer, Lili Yu
- **Abstract**: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for sequential modeling, but their inability to leverage modality-specific features limits their performance in multi-modal pretraining. Here, we propose Mixture-of-Mamba, a novel SSM architecture that introduces modality-aware sparsity through modality-specific parameterization of the Mamba block. Building on Mixture-of-Transformers (W. Liang et al. arXiv:2411.04996; 2024), we extend the benefits of modality-aware sparsity to SSMs while preserving their computational efficiency. We evaluate Mixture-of-Mamba across three multi-modal pretraining settings: Transfusion (interleaved text and continuous image tokens with diffusion loss), Chameleon (interleaved text and discrete image tokens), and an extended three-modality framework incorporating speech. Mixture-of-Mamba consistently reaches the same loss values at earlier training steps with significantly reduced computational costs. In the Transfusion setting, Mixture-of-Mamba achieves equivalent image loss using only 34.76% of the training FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. In the Chameleon setting, Mixture-of-Mamba reaches similar image loss with just 42.50% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale, and similar text loss with just 65.40% of the FLOPs. In the three-modality setting, MoM matches speech loss at 24.80% of the FLOPs at the 1.4B scale. Our ablation study highlights the synergistic effects of decoupling projection components, where joint decoupling yields greater gains than individual modifications. These results establish modality-aware sparsity as a versatile and effective design principle, extending its impact from Transformers to SSMs and setting new benchmarks in multi-modal pretraining. Our code can be accessed at https://github.com/Weixin-Liang/Mixture-of-Mamba
- **Summary**: **Summary** The paper proposes Mixture-of-Mamba, an innovative state space model (SSM) architecture that improves multi-modal pretraining by introducing modality-aware sparsity. This advancement draws from the prior work of Mixture-of-Transformers, creating a framework that utilizes modality-specific parameterization to capitalize on the unique features of different data types within existing computationally efficient SSMs. The authors test the Mixture-of-Mamba model across three pretraining scenarios: Transfusion, Chameleon, and a three-modality framework involving speech. The results demonstrate that Mixture-of-Mamba achieves comparable loss values to previous models at significantly reduced computational costs, illustrating its efficiency and effectiveness in multi-modal contexts. Key findings include significantly lower training FLOPs needed to reach equivalent performance levels in comparison to traditional approaches, as well as findings from an ablation study indicating the effectiveness of decoupling model components. **Critical Evaluation** **Novelty:** Mixture-of-Mamba presents a meaningful advance in the realm of multi-modal SSMs by innovating upon the existing framework of sparse parameterization. While the idea of modality-aware sparsity is not entirely new, applying it effectively to SSMs represents a fresh approach that extends beyond Transformers. The introductory combination of modality awareness into the SSM architecture is noteworthy, and the specific applications to multi-modal pretraining paradigms reflect a careful consideration of the field's needs. **Significance:** This work has the potential to affect ongoing research in sequential modeling, especially in areas where different modalities (text, images, speech) need to be integrated efficiently. By reducing computational costs while maintaining performance, this model could facilitate wider adoption of SSMs in practical applications that handle rich, diverse datasets. **Strengths:**  - The architecture demonstrates significant computational efficiency, suggesting it could enable more robust applications in real-world scenarios. - The systematic evaluation across three distinct frameworks provides comprehensive insights into the capabilities of the proposed model. - The ablation study reinforces the findings and suggests relevant areas for future improvements and research. **Weaknesses:**  - While the model achieves reduced computational costs, the paper does not deeply address potential trade-offs in model complexity or interpretability that may arise from using sparsity. - The exploration of the model's performance in practical, less controlled environments might be beneficial. - There could be a concern regarding the generalizability of the model across other tasks that were not evaluated. **Influence on the Field:** The contributions of Mixture-of-Mamba may set a new standard for future multi-modal SSMs, providing a solid foundation for further research that incorporates modality-aware designs. However, its ultimate impact will largely depend on subsequent validation across a broader range of tasks beyond the evaluated settings. **Score: 8** This score reflects a solid contribution to the field, considering its innovative approach and potential benefits, while acknowledging the need for additional exploration into long-term effects and broader applications. The paper successfully highlights an important architectural advancement, which could pave the way for more efficient multi-modal modeling in the future.

### FALCON: Resolving Visual Redundancy and Fragmentation in High-resolution Multimodal Large Language Models via Visual Registers
- **Link**: [Link to Paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16297v1)
- **Authors**: Renshan Zhang, Rui Shao, Gongwei Chen, Kaiwen Zhou, Weili Guan, Liqiang Nie
- **Abstract**: The incorporation of high-resolution visual input equips multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with enhanced visual perception capabilities for real-world tasks. However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces FALCON, a novel model designed to enhance high-resolution multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by addressing two key problems: visual redundancy and fragmentation in visual encoding. Existing methods primarily utilize cropping techniques, which lead to increased redundancies in visual tokens and fragmentary representations. FALCON employs a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism that introduces learnable visual registers aimed at aggregating important visual information while reducing redundancies. This results in a more compact visual encoding without the need for additional compression mechanisms. Furthermore, to maintain continuity in visual encoding that may suffer due to fragmented inputs, the model incorporates a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module allows for effective interaction between visual registers, enhancing information flow and coherence across sub-images. Experimental results demonstrate that FALCON significantly reduces visual token counts while improving performance across various high-resolution benchmarks. --- **Evaluation of Novelty and Significance:** **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** FALCON introduces a fresh perspective on managing high-resolution visual data within MLLMs. The incorporation of visual registers is a novel contribution that effectively targets redundancy, a critical issue in prior methods.    2. **Performance Gains:** The reported results indicate that FALCON achieves a significant reduction in visual tokens (by 9-fold to 16-fold) while maintaining or improving model performance, suggesting that the introduced mechanisms are both effective and impactful. 3. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The authors conduct a thorough set of experiments across a diversity of benchmarks, lending credence to the claims of enhanced performance and systematic benefits of the proposed model structure. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Complexity and Applicability:** While innovative, the model's reliance on adaptive learnable components (visual registers) could complicate implementation and scalability. The effectiveness of FALCON on datasets other than those tested remains unclear and may limit its broader applicability. 2. **Comparative Baselines:** While the paper demonstrates performance improvements, it would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of existing state-of-the-art models to firmly establish its relative advantages in different scenarios. 3. **Potential Overfitting:** Introducing multiple new components might lead to risks of overfitting, especially on smaller datasets, which could be a consideration that needs addressing in future work. **Overall Assessment:** FALCON presents a compelling advancement in MLLM technology, resolving notable issues related to visual input processing effectively and innovatively. However, its complexity and the need for broader benchmarking could hinder immediate adoption. The combination of technical soundness and significant performance enhancements underscores its importance in the field. **Score: 8**  This score reflects FALCON’s strong innovative contribution and potential to influence research in multimodal models, balanced by concerns regarding implementation complexity and the need for broader validation against various models and datasets.

- **Authors**: Tzoulio Chamiti, Nikolaos Passalis, Anastasios Tefas
- **Abstract**: Autonomous aerial monitoring is an important task aimed at gathering information from areas that may not be easily accessible by humans. At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deep learning models to enhance autonomous aerial monitoring, focusing on active perception and anomaly detection. The method involves a dialogue between an LLM and a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model that controls a drone. The LLM generates exploratory questions while guiding the drone through scenes to collect information and detect anomalies. The framework operates within a high-fidelity simulation where movement commands are translated into executable actions. The interactive dialogue enriches scene descriptions beyond conventional static approaches and improves identification of potential hazards. The experimental results indicate the framework's effectiveness in actively perceiving and alerting users about anomalies. ### Critical Evaluation #### Novelty The paper introduces a unique application of LLMs in the domain of autonomous aerial monitoring, which has not been extensively explored prior to this. The interaction between the LLM and the VQA model to drive drone movement represents a creative fusion of language processing and visual analysis, setting it apart from traditional static perception systems. The concept of using a conversational AI to guide exploratory data collection in real-time is innovative and could pave the way for more dynamic UAV applications. #### Significance The proposed framework has significant implications for enhancing the capabilities of autonomous monitoring systems, particularly in environments where human interaction is limited. The potential for improved anomaly detection could translate into practical benefits in fields such as disaster response, environmental monitoring, and security. However, the impact is somewhat tempered since the research is conducted in a simulated environment, raising questions about its real-world applicability and scalability. #### Strengths - The use of dialogue between models presents a fresh approach to active perception, which could enhance data gathering significantly compared to static methods. - The interdisciplinary application of language models in robotic systems is noteworthy and contributes to both AI and robotics fields. - Detailed descriptions and insights from the generated dialogue can aid in richer scene understanding, which is critical in various monitoring applications. #### Weaknesses - The reliance on simulations may limit the external validity of the findings. Future validation in real-world scenarios is necessary to assess performance. - There is little discussion on the computational costs or real-time constraints associated with implementing the framework in actual drone operations. - The paper could further explore the limitations of the models used, including issues like misunderstanding commands or processing delays during drone operation. ### Overall Assessment The framework shows considerable promise and introduces meaningful advancements in the integration of AI into autonomous systems. However, the limitations identified warrant caution regarding the systemic applicability of the findings in practical scenarios. **Score: 7**  This score reflects a solid contribution that could influence the field of autonomous monitoring, but it acknowledges the need for further empirical validation and exploration of practical challenges.

- **Authors**: Zheng Liu, Chaofan Li, Shitao Xiao, Chaozhuo Li, Defu Lian, Yingxia Shao
- **Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) provide powerful foundations to perform fine-grained text re-ranking. However, they are often prohibitive in reality due to constraints on computation bandwidth. In this work, we propose a \textbf{flexible} architecture called \textbf{Matroyshka Re-Ranker}, which is designed to facilitate \textbf{runtime customization} of model layers and sequence lengths at each layer based on users' configurations. Consequently, the LLM-based re-rankers can be made applicable across various real-world situations. The increased flexibility may come at the cost of precision loss. To address this problem, we introduce a suite of techniques to optimize the performance. First, we propose \textbf{cascaded self-distillation}, where each sub-architecture learns to preserve a precise re-ranking performance from its super components, whose predictions can be exploited as smooth and informative teacher signals. Second, we design a \textbf{factorized compensation mechanism}, where two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules, vertical and horizontal, are jointly employed to compensate for the precision loss resulted from arbitrary combinations of layer and sequence compression. We perform comprehensive experiments based on the passage and document retrieval datasets from MSMARCO, along with all public datasets from BEIR benchmark. In our experiments, Matryoshka Re-Ranker substantially outperforms the existing methods, while effectively preserving its superior performance across various forms of compression and different application scenarios.
- **Summary**: **Summary of the Paper:** The paper introduces the Matryoshka Re-Ranker, a flexible architecture designed for fine-grained text re-ranking using large language models (LLMs). It allows custom runtime configurations for the number of layers and sequence lengths, making it suitable for various real-world scenarios while addressing computational constraints. The proposed system employs cascaded self-distillation to maintain re-ranking precision and a factorized compensation mechanism with two collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation modules to mitigate precision loss from layer and sequence compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Matryoshka Re-Ranker outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets, showcasing robust performance despite using various compression techniques. **Critical Evaluation:** The novelty of the Matryoshka Re-Ranker lies in its flexible architecture that allows for runtime customization, which is a relevant and significant addition to the field of text re-ranking. By enabling users to tailor model depth and width according to resource availability, it effectively addresses the efficiency bottlenecks often encountered with large language models in practical applications. The incorporation of techniques like cascaded self-distillation and a compensation mechanism showcases an innovative approach to dealing with the inherent trade-offs involved in flexibility versus precision. However, the paper has certain weaknesses. While it provides a strong empirical performance analysis, it lacks a deep theoretical foundation to explain why the proposed techniques such as the factorization compensation yield better results. Straightforward experiments might not fully capture the model's performance across diverse real-world applications outside the studied datasets, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the potential simplicity of the implementation may not explore all the complexities involved in high-stakes applications where precision is critical, and the implications of using reduced models can lead to systematic errors. In summary, while the Matryoshka Re-Ranker demonstrates innovative approaches to a pressing challenge in utilizing LLMs efficiently, its empirical focus could be complemented with a stronger theoretical grounding and broader testing environments. **Score: 7**

- **Authors**: Long Nguyen, Huy Nguyen, Bao Khuu, Huy Luu, Huy Le, Tuan Nguyen, Tho Quan
- **Abstract**: Retrieving events from videos using text queries has become increasingly challenging due to the rapid growth of multimedia content. Existing methods for text-based video event retrieval often focus heavily on object-level descriptions, overlooking the crucial role of contextual information. This limitation is especially apparent when queries lack sufficient context, such as missing location details or ambiguous background elements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel system called RAPID (Retrieval-Augmented Parallel Inference Drafting), which leverages advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt-based learning to semantically correct and enrich user queries with relevant contextual information. These enriched queries are then processed through parallel retrieval, followed by an evaluation step to select the most relevant results based on their alignment with the original query. Through extensive experiments on our custom-developed dataset, we demonstrate that RAPID significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods, particularly for contextually incomplete queries. Our system was validated for both speed and accuracy through participation in the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, where it successfully retrieved events from over 300 hours of video. Further evaluation comparing RAPID with the baseline proposed by the competition organizers demonstrated its superior effectiveness, highlighting the strength and robustness of our approach.

It identifies the inadequacy of existing methods that primarily focus on object-level descriptions, neglecting the importance of contextual information, especially when queries lack detailed context. The authors propose a novel system, RAPID, which enhances text queries by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to supplement missing contextual elements. The enriched queries are processed using parallel retrieval mechanisms, followed by an evaluation process selecting the most relevant video events. The system was extensively tested on a custom dataset and showed substantial improvements over traditional methods, especially for queries lacking context. Its effectiveness was also demonstrated during the Ho Chi Minh City AI Challenge 2024, outperforming competitors in both speed and accuracy with successful event retrieval from a large video dataset. --- **Critical Evaluation:** **Novelty:**  RAPID presents a notable advancement in the domain of text-based video event retrieval. By harnessing the capabilities of LLMs for context enrichment, it addresses a significant gap in existing retrieval systems that primarily focus on objects while neglecting crucial context. This is particularly relevant in real-world applications where users might formulate ambiguous or incomplete queries. The approach of combining contextual augmentation with parallel retrieval is relatively novel and suggests a creative application of prompt-based learning in this field. **Significance:** The results demonstrate that RAPID markedly improves retrieval performance, which could have a profound impact on various applications, such as video search engines, digital libraries, and even security systems where event detection is crucial. The paper's empirical validation at a reputable competition adds to its significance, showcasing its effectiveness in a competitive environment against alternative strategies. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The integration of LLMs for augmenting queries is a creative solution to the contextual shortfall in traditional methods. 2. **Robust Evaluation:** The system was tested on a custom-developed dataset, providing compelling evidence of its performance and applicability. 3. **Contextual Emphasis:** The focus on enriching queries to handle contextual ambiguities addresses a meaningful gap in current methodologies. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Dependency on LLMs:** While LLMs are a strength, their dependency may also limit the system's deployment in environments where such models are resource-intensive or impractical. 2. **Generalizability:** The performance improvement is presented based on a specific dataset.

- **Authors**: Meiyun Cao, Shaw Hu, Jason Sharp, Edward Clouser, Jason Holmes, Linda L. Lam, Xiaoning Ding, Diego Santos Toesca, Wendy S. Lindholm, Samir H. Patel, Sujay A. Vora, Peilong Wang, Wei Liu
- **Abstract**: Purpose: This study aims to use a large language model (LLM) to automate the generation of summaries from the CT simulation orders and evaluate its performance. Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference. Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.
- **Summary**: **Summary:** This paper investigates the efficacy of utilizing a large language model (LLM), specifically the Llama 3.1 405B model, to automate the summarization of CT simulation orders within the field of radiation oncology. A total of 607 CT simulation orders were sourced from a clinical database, and these were systematically categorized based on treatment modalities and disease sites. Customized prompts were developed in collaboration with therapists to guide the LLM in generating summaries. The generated summaries were compared against manually created "ground truth" summaries, with the results showing that approximately 98% of the LLM-produced summaries were accurate. Additionally, improvements in summary formatting and readability were reported. The findings highlight the LLM's consistent performance across various treatment contexts, indicating its potential utility in reducing therapist workload and enhancing workflow efficiency. **Critical Evaluation:** The paper addresses a significant area of need within radiation oncology: the automation of summarizing clinical documentation, which is a labor-intensive task for therapists. By evaluating the performance of a state-of-the-art LLM in this context, the authors provide a tangible application of artificial intelligence in improving clinical workflows. The study employs a robust methodology, including the use of a large dataset and collaboration with clinicians to inform the LLM's usage. The reported accuracy and improvements in readability of the generated summaries are notable strengths that suggest practical applicability in a clinical setting. However, there are limitations that warrant attention. While the high accuracy rate is impressive, the study would benefit from a more extensive examination of the generalizability of the Llama model across different institutions and broader clinical scenarios. Additionally, potential biases in the dataset, the methodology for deriving ground truth summaries, and the subjective evaluation by therapists could introduce inconsistencies that are not adequately addressed in the paper. The novelty of applying LLMs in summarizing medical documentation has been noted in several studies; therefore, while this study advances the field, it is not entirely pioneering in its application. Despite these weaknesses, the study's contribution to workflow efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in summarizing CT simulation orders is valuable. It points toward a future where LLMs can support clinicians significantly, potentially allowing them to focus on patient care rather than administrative documentation. **Score: 7** This score reflects the paper's significant contributions to the intersection of artificial intelligence and clinical workflows, tempered by the need for further validation and exploration of the broader applicability of the findings outside the specific context examined.

- **Abstract**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation and editing, with recent advancements enabling albedo-preserving image relighting. However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.
- **Summary**: ### Summary: The paper titled "RelightVid: Temporal-Consistent Diffusion Model for Video Relighting" presents a novel framework, RelightVid, aimed at overcoming challenges in video relighting through the application of diffusion models. While diffusion models have excelled in image generation and editing, their use in video has been hindered by issues such as the absence of paired datasets and the need for temporal consistency and fidelity. RelightVid addresses these concerns by allowing various relighting conditions, including background video, text prompts, or environment maps. The framework is trained on a diverse set of in-the-wild videos and utilizes illumination augmentations to maintain high temporal consistency. Notably, it does this without the need for intrinsic decomposition and while preserving illumination priors from image models. ### Critical Evaluation: **Novelty:** The approach of using a diffusion model for video relighting is a significant innovation as it cuts across traditional boundaries in video processing. By focusing on a framework that allows for flexible relighting inputs and is trained on diverse video sources, the authors have introduced a mechanism that is likely to set a benchmark in the field. The proposed method's capability of achieving temporal consistency while maintaining high fidelity adds to its uniqueness. **Significance:** The significance of the work is underscored by the persistent challenges in video relighting, particularly given the growing importance of video content creation and editing in various fields, including gaming, film, and virtual reality. The potential applications of this technology may influence creative processes and lead to advancements in related fields, thereby reinforcing its importance. **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The application of diffusion models to video relighting introduces fresh perspectives in the field. 2. **Performance:** The high temporal consistency achieved through training on diverse videos is impressive and addresses a key limitation in previous models. 3. **Versatile Input Conditions:** The ability to handle multiple inputs (video, text prompts, environment maps) broadens the applicability of the model significantly. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Lack of Extensive Benchmarking:** While the authors mention general performance metrics, comprehensive comparisons against existing state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the findings. 2. **Generalizability Concerns:** The effectiveness in diverse real-world scenarios and varying lighting conditions may need further exploration and validation. 3. **Decomposition Claim:** The assertion that it accomplishes relighting without intrinsic decomposition should be substantiated with rigorous empirical results, as this is typically a key aspect of photorealistic video relighting. **Potential Influence:** The paper's contribution has the potential to inspire further research into temporal video editing and set the stage for advancements in related areas, such as augmented reality and content creation tools that leverage machine learning for enhanced visual effects.
