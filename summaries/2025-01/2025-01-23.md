- **Abstract**: We propose Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), a novel approach to accelerate diffusion models' inference. ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The quality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP Image Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.
- **Summary**: ### Summary The paper presents Inner Loop Feedback (ILF), an innovative method aimed at enhancing the inference speed of diffusion models. ILF introduces a lightweight module that predicts future features during the denoising process by using outputs from a specific block in the diffusion backbone at a particular time step. The method relies on two primary insights: that outputs from adjacent time steps are typically similar and that performing partial computations on a step is more efficient than completely skipping it. The feedback module can be based on any block from the diffusion backbone, with its effect modulated by a learnable scaling factor initialized to zero. ILF is trained using distillation losses, but unlike previous approaches, the backbone is kept frozen, focusing the training on the feedback module. The goal is to achieve high image quality in fewer steps while reducing runtime effectively. Empirical results demonstrate that ILF can significantly match the performance of diffusion models that require more steps while achieving 1.7x to 1.8x speedups based on metrics like FID, CLIP score, and qualitative assessments. ### Evaluation of Novelty and Significance **Strengths:** 1. **Innovative Approach:** The Inner Loop Feedback methodology introduces an efficient mechanism to predict future features during the denoising process, which can be seen as a novel contribution in the realm of diffusion models. 2. **Practical Implications:** Reducing inference time while maintaining image quality is a significant challenge in the field. ILF demonstrates that this can be achieved by leveraging existing network structures creatively. 3. **Robust Testing:** The paper supports its claims with various quantitative metrics, such as FID and CLIP scores, providing a well-rounded validation of the proposed method's effectiveness. **Weaknesses:** 1. **Limited Scope of Improvement:** While ILF does provide speed improvements, the extent to which it impacts broader applications or more complex diffusion models remains unclear. The paper does not sufficiently explore all potential environments where this technique may or may not apply. 2. **Assumption on Similarity:** The approach relies heavily on the assumption that outputs from adjacent steps are similar. While this may hold for many cases, exceptions could limit the approach's robustness. 3. **Interaction with Other Techniques:** The paper does not extensively discuss how ILF can be integrated with or benefit from existing acceleration techniques in diffusion models, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its applicability. **Impact on the Field:** ILF's approach to deepening the understanding of the efficient use of feedback mechanisms in diffusion models may spur further research into optimizing inference speeds in other types of generative models. However, its adoption and relevance will highly depend on the community's reception and further corroboration through empirical testing in diverse scenarios. **Score Justification:** Assigning a score of 7 reflects the paper's notable innovation and practical contributions to the field, balanced with concerns regarding the limits of its assumptions and the potential for broader integration. It stands out for clarity and rigorous empirical evaluation, yet the need for wider applicability and consideration of the competitive landscape reduces the maximum impact score. **Score: 7**
